[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.720 --> 00:46.800]  Here we are, Monday, January 2nd, 2012. That's gonna take some getting used to. We're gonna
[00:46.800 --> 00:53.600]  be here for the next three hours, live. And we don't have any guests today. I want to
[00:53.600 --> 00:56.400]  have open phones throughout the three hours.
[00:56.400 --> 01:07.640]  Obviously, I wanna break down the New Year's Eve signing of the traitorous puppet in chief,
[01:07.640 --> 01:15.200]  Barack Hussein, who really knows who he is, Obama, and the treacherous Republican Congress
[01:15.200 --> 01:22.560]  that helped ram it through with the help of the Democrats, who are nothing more than errand
[01:22.560 --> 01:29.940]  boys, grocers clerks, carrying out a little errand for their masters, the foreign offshore
[01:29.940 --> 01:35.760]  banks that have taken over our society.
[01:35.760 --> 01:43.480]  I saw a clip on infowars.com, an article Kurt Nemo wrote over the weekend with another
[01:43.480 --> 01:49.300]  national talk show host and his guest caller, saying that anybody that likes Ron Paul is
[01:49.300 --> 02:00.600]  an anti-Semite. And that I'm an anti-Semite. And that if you don't like what the bankers
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.200]  are doing to you, you're an anti-Semite. I mean, always injecting that into everything.
[02:06.200 --> 02:13.720]  That's why the system is so discredited. And that's why we're in such a deep crisis. Because
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.920]  the establishment has taken over the planet through fraud and through deception, but now
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.980]  the world is waking up to it.
[02:19.980 --> 02:27.120]  And the establishment is just going ahead with everything, and it's on a collision course.
[02:27.120 --> 02:32.920]  It's not as I went to bed at about midnight, I just laid there in the bed marveling at
[02:32.920 --> 02:41.040]  how textbook and how over the top absurdist the cameras and the black uniforms and the
[02:41.040 --> 02:48.080]  ski mask and the checkpoints and the hands down the pants DSA.
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.080]  And the jumbo screens all over the country with Homeland Security head saying I'm here
[02:53.080 --> 03:03.480]  to protect you, don't trust your neighbors, and the raids on Amish. And the push for forced
[03:03.480 --> 03:10.680]  inoculation and the giant prisons everywhere, and the brainwashing of police and military
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.480]  and the announcements of indefinite detention.
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.360]  It's right out of a dystopic novel. And the reason it was hitting me so hard is I watched
[03:20.360 --> 03:25.960]  Equilibrium with Christian Bale last night when I was on the treadmill. Again, I'm trying
[03:25.960 --> 03:32.720]  to run two twice a day. And I was watching and I hadn't watched it in a few years. And
[03:32.720 --> 03:37.080]  it came out a decade ago or so and it was like the government's forced drugging people
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.220]  that's going on to the food, the water, and then overtly through pharmakeia and the illegal
[03:41.220 --> 03:44.360]  drugs they ship in, the big pharma as well.
[03:44.360 --> 03:53.340]  There's big jumbotron screens saying only trust your big brother government everywhere.
[03:53.340 --> 03:58.720]  There's police in black uniforms with machine guns. There's armored vehicles driving around
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.800]  the streets. There's paramilitary police SWAT teaming people. And that's basically where
[04:03.800 --> 04:10.660]  we are. And now they're announcing, hey, we're gonna start censoring your speech.
[04:10.660 --> 04:14.400]  And even the inventors of the Internet admit it's the end of Internet freedom as we know
[04:14.400 --> 04:22.640]  it. It's all happening. But there are 400 million guns conservatively of new manufacture.
[04:22.640 --> 04:30.500]  That's the last eight years is how they gauge it in this country. There's over 150 million
[04:30.500 --> 04:43.340]  gun owners. Record gun sales took place the last month. And you've got one guy in Washington
[04:43.340 --> 04:47.480]  State who's running from the cops, and they got hundreds of them out there for one guy
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.480]  with guns.
[04:48.480 --> 04:56.400]  I mean, it just shows you how the system is a paper tiger, but it thinks it's invincible.
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.360]  It's gonna start a war with the American people. We'll talk about it coming up.
[05:00.360 --> 05:05.020]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:05.020 --> 05:09.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.360 --> 05:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.000]  you to have.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.700]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.700 --> 05:25.040]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:25.040 --> 05:30.040]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[05:30.040 --> 05:34.260]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[05:34.260 --> 05:38.880]  power from weather related damages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[05:38.880 --> 05:43.040]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[05:43.040 --> 05:47.360]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[05:47.360 --> 05:54.360]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[05:54.360 --> 06:03.720]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365. Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to
[06:03.720 --> 06:08.320]  tell you about the silver lungs generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[06:08.320 --> 06:13.280]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[06:13.280 --> 06:17.500]  through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[06:17.500 --> 06:23.520]  pathogens and viruses. The silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self
[06:23.520 --> 06:29.640]  produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the
[06:29.640 --> 06:35.160]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products. You can
[06:35.160 --> 06:41.000]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator. Very easy
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.960]  to follow step by step instructions are provided making production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com
[06:48.960 --> 06:53.440]  today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator.
[06:53.440 --> 07:04.520]  That's www.silverlungs.com. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[07:04.520 --> 07:10.120]  alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[07:10.120 --> 07:15.640]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[07:15.640 --> 07:20.920]  on our president and Congress. And they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[07:20.920 --> 07:26.480]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies
[07:26.480 --> 07:32.480]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.400]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[07:37.400 --> 07:41.520]  They're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[07:41.520 --> 07:47.360]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall
[07:47.360 --> 07:54.040]  of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watching
[07:54.040 --> 08:03.540]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet.tv. From his central Texas command
[08:03.540 --> 08:11.000]  center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN
[08:11.000 --> 08:24.760]  radio network.
[08:24.760 --> 08:32.680]  Here we are. It is the first live radio transmission that I've engaged in in the new year. It of
[08:32.680 --> 08:42.160]  course is Monday, the second day of January, 2011, 2012, 2013. That's gonna take some getting
[08:42.160 --> 08:50.260]  used to. By the time I'm accustomed to saying 2012, it'll already be 2013. But we are gonna
[08:50.260 --> 08:57.400]  be here for the next three hours today on this Monday, the second day of January, 2012.
[08:57.400 --> 09:05.220]  And later in the transmission, I do want to give you my breakdown of what I think is going
[09:05.220 --> 09:12.260]  to unfold in 2012 and what we're going to see the establishment do in this key year.
[09:12.260 --> 09:17.900]  On so many fronts with Iran, with the global economy, with the domestic police state that's
[09:17.900 --> 09:22.880]  being duplicated, not just here in the United States, but all over the world. That is all
[09:22.880 --> 09:32.840]  coming up today. And then I have this little economist article, and the cover of it says,
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.360]  reviving the world economy, stand back, I'm a central banker.
[09:37.360 --> 09:45.400]  And it takes a famous, I guess, Dutch painting of doctors engaging in a dissection of a dead
[09:45.400 --> 09:50.880]  body. But instead, the central banker is holding defibrillators like he's gonna restart the
[09:50.880 --> 09:58.120]  heart of the economy. This would be more accurate if it showed the central bankers as vampires,
[09:58.120 --> 10:08.840]  and all sinking their teeth into the not quite yet dead person, soon to be cadaver.
[10:08.840 --> 10:15.120]  Then it would be accurate, but this is the problem. They always sell the central bankers
[10:15.120 --> 10:24.520]  as the solution to every problem when they are on its face, the complete authors of the
[10:24.520 --> 10:30.960]  architecture of the system we live under today. You can certainly partially blame the public
[10:30.960 --> 10:34.000]  for being lazy and easy to con for this happening.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.440]  We can all blame ourselves and look in the mirror at one level or another. And for all
[10:38.440 --> 10:47.080]  of us selling out at even at a subconscious level to the system. But the main drivers,
[10:47.080 --> 10:58.680]  the captains of the ship, the New World Order system, those piloting our culture are the
[10:58.680 --> 11:06.600]  six mega private banks that created the front consortiums of the so called Federal Reserve,
[11:06.600 --> 11:13.560]  European Central Bank, Bank of England, which are just their quasi government fronts to
[11:13.560 --> 11:15.680]  carry out their crimes.
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.600]  They are the enemy. They are the authors of the carbon tax, of the open borders, of the
[11:20.600 --> 11:27.380]  imperial wars, of the police state, of the medical mafia pushing forced inoculations.
[11:27.380 --> 11:33.160]  In every case, it is a handful of families that are the private shareholders of the six
[11:33.160 --> 11:40.000]  global mega banks. We've listened to them here many times, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.600]  Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and then a few other European consortium banks
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.420]  that are all really owned by the same people.
[11:49.420 --> 11:56.240]  So it's six consortiums and they are the authors of it all. I mean, I showed you The Economist
[11:56.240 --> 12:07.880]  Magazine from November. And this is the type of publication, just like the Times of London
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.440]  or the Financial Times, which is even more important, where they throw it in your face.
[12:12.440 --> 12:16.880]  Remember that article a few years ago by the foreign editor of the Financial Times of London,
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.640]  headline and now for world government? Please put that on screen. If you're a radio listener
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.520]  on XM or local AM and FM, you're saying put it on screen. Yes, we're simulcasting everything
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.340]  at prisonplanet.tv and we also have the nightly news there if you're a subscriber, but we've
[12:31.340 --> 12:36.560]  now started a system where you can watch a lower res version of the show live and not
[12:36.560 --> 12:39.720]  just the audio at mfullwars.com there on the right hand corner.
[12:39.720 --> 12:45.680]  Now everybody can basically watch if you go to mfullwars.com and click the upper watch
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.160]  the show live banner. You can actually see this for yourself. There it is. And now for
[12:50.160 --> 12:58.760]  world government, December 9, 2008. Wow, that seems like yesterday. That's actually three
[12:58.760 --> 13:05.300]  years ago. Wow, a little over three years ago. And he goes on to say, yes, there's a
[13:05.300 --> 13:07.400]  private global corporate government.
[13:07.400 --> 13:14.620]  Yes, it's authoritarian in nature. Go read the article. And yes, we're going to take
[13:14.620 --> 13:20.260]  your liberties, but it's because your nation states are primitive. That's why they have
[13:20.260 --> 13:26.140]  an image of a cave drawing there. And we know best we're technocrats and we kept a secret
[13:26.140 --> 13:31.920]  from you for your own interest. And that is exactly what The Economist, November 19th,
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.940]  the 25th weekly edition that I've covered so much here said.
[13:36.940 --> 13:41.040]  They say yes technocrats have run things in the Soviet era and didn't do probably the
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.100]  best job, but our technocrats are better. And they say in here, you can argue that this
[13:46.100 --> 13:51.800]  is the best system now and regardless that's what runs things. So it is an apologetic open
[13:51.800 --> 13:58.220]  world government article, but saying it's for your own interest.
[13:58.220 --> 14:06.460]  And that particular article is titled Minds Like Machines, technocrats. Minds like machines,
[14:06.460 --> 14:10.520]  technocracy was once a communist idea with the proletarian power administration could
[14:10.520 --> 14:21.040]  be left to experts. Yes, or we have a big computer run everything. There's the actual
[14:21.040 --> 14:24.400]  article, I have my little photocopies here so I can highlight it.
[14:24.400 --> 14:30.760]  And it goes on, technocracy and autocracy have long been natural bedfellows. Technocrats
[14:30.760 --> 14:36.400]  rule big chunks of public life, central bankers are one example. And it goes on here, even
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.560]  highly political governments set up independent or bipartisan panels that make difficult decisions.
[14:41.560 --> 14:45.340]  So spending bills originate in the super congress now, not by individual members, such as closing
[14:45.340 --> 14:50.120]  military bases, setting electoral boundaries and making spending cuts.
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.920]  No, it's supposed to be simple votes. They create independent agencies, all independent
[14:54.920 --> 14:59.800]  but the globalists run them, to run everything from healthcare to education. They put outside
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.080]  experts in top jobs such as the economist Larry Summers and the Clinton administration
[15:04.080 --> 15:10.920]  and Obama administrations that got rid of Glass-Steagall. Yeah, what great experts they
[15:10.920 --> 15:11.920]  were.
[15:11.920 --> 15:16.080]  And then you go on here, let me find the actual part. They got another quote where it says,
[15:16.080 --> 15:23.280]  and yes, you can argue that we need technocrats now, they know how to run things best. Now,
[15:23.280 --> 15:30.840]  I just showed you the, in fact, reprint me that because there were two versions. He had
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.360]  another one that was a blog responding to everybody. I don't know if that's the blog
[15:34.360 --> 15:39.920]  or the original article, scroll up for me, please, so I can read it.
[15:39.920 --> 15:51.200]  And when you read it there, he actually breaks down that it's for the betterment of everybody.
[15:51.200 --> 15:59.160]  He says, I've never believed that there is a secret. Put it back on screen for me, please.
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.360]  I've never believed that there is a secret United Nations plot to take over the US. I've
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.040]  never seen black helicopters hovering in the sky above Montana. But for the first time
[16:08.040 --> 16:13.560]  in my life, I think the formation of some sort of world government is plausible, a world
[16:13.560 --> 16:14.560]  government.
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.320]  So again, if you don't like world government, you're a kook, but we need one. And I think
[16:19.320 --> 16:23.960]  this is his blog response when he got attacked for saying we need a world government. A world
[16:23.960 --> 16:31.360]  government would involve much more than cooperation between nations. It would be an entity with
[16:31.360 --> 16:34.900]  state-like characteristics backed by a body of laws.
[16:34.900 --> 16:39.440]  The European Union has already set up a continental government for 27 countries, which could be
[16:39.440 --> 16:45.040]  the model. The EU has the Supreme Court, a currency, thousands of pages of law, a civil
[16:45.040 --> 16:54.000]  service, and an ability to deploy military force. So could the European model go global?
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.760]  There are three reasons for thinking that it might. First, it's increasingly clear that
[16:58.760 --> 17:04.040]  the most difficult issues facing national governments are international in nature.
[17:04.040 --> 17:08.360]  There is a global warming, a global financial crisis, and a global war on terror. And what
[17:08.360 --> 17:13.360]  did Club of Rome say in the 60s? We'll use the terror threat, the environmental threat,
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.920]  and other threats, global problems unify it. In fact, I just went to that article from
[17:17.920 --> 17:18.920]  memory, print it for me.
[17:18.920 --> 17:23.080]  I'm gonna highlight the parts, and I think that's the second part. There's a first part
[17:23.080 --> 17:27.560]  where he comes out and says, yes, it's authoritarian in nature. Yes, we kept it from you, but it's
[17:27.560 --> 17:36.000]  for your own good. The point is that here they are saying Larry Summers will fix everything
[17:36.000 --> 17:46.360]  when it's Larry Summers who got rid of the Glass-Steagall with Obama's progenitor, the
[17:46.360 --> 17:48.000]  Clintons.
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.480]  And then now Larry Summers is back advising under Obama. And do people expect there to
[17:53.480 --> 18:01.720]  be any change when this is the policy? We go to the people that engineered all of this
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.000]  and we read publications that they own and control who never even mentioned, hey, they're
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.680]  the ones that did all this when it's as obvious as the nose on your face.
[18:09.680 --> 18:15.920]  And so I'm gonna be breaking that down later in the broadcast. I've already started doing
[18:15.920 --> 18:23.200]  it here right now. Now when we come back from break, I'm gonna break down obviously the
[18:23.200 --> 18:28.340]  top news of the day and try to go through every angle and facet of it.
[18:28.340 --> 18:36.520]  That's why I've written here on construction paper. I got up in the middle of the night,
[18:36.520 --> 18:39.920]  was creeping around the house and the first paper I came across was some of the children's
[18:39.920 --> 18:45.680]  construction paper. So I wrote, I don't know, three, four pages of notes here, breaking
[18:45.680 --> 18:57.240]  down why the different formulae that are used, why would Obama say he'd veto the bill because
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.840]  it had indefinite detention for citizens in it, and then sign the bill.
[19:01.840 --> 19:06.140]  And then it emerges that it was the White House demanded those provisions be there and
[19:06.140 --> 19:16.720]  Obama knew that. And I break down why they deceive that way, why they do that, and what
[19:16.720 --> 19:23.240]  the NDAA does and where things are going. But where are all the people out there who
[19:23.240 --> 19:29.640]  for over 16 years said Alex Jones is a kook, there's no plan to put military on the streets.
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.520]  Now that it's in Stars and Stripes, the Army Times, the National News, now they've shifted
[19:34.520 --> 19:42.200]  from you're still a kook because you don't want the military on the streets.
[19:42.200 --> 19:47.360]  And then now I hear them defending the military doing drills to confiscate our guns. So we're
[19:47.360 --> 19:52.880]  gonna break all of that down today, then we're gonna get into what's happening in the Eurozone
[19:52.880 --> 19:58.160]  record gun sales and more. It's a very important transmission lined up. Stay with us. First

[21:34.120 --> 21:38.340]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:38.340 --> 21:42.480]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[21:42.480 --> 21:46.000]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.480]  army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[21:50.480 --> 21:57.520]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.520]  That's 800-686-2237.
[21:58.520 --> 22:06.080]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis. Everyone can feel it.
[22:06.080 --> 22:11.600]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[22:11.600 --> 22:18.740]  who love darkness, bondage and enslavement. Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take
[22:18.740 --> 22:24.160]  heart for every action. There is an equal and opposite reaction. Recently, New World
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.880]  Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war. We are in an information
[22:29.880 --> 22:36.160]  war and we are losing that war. The globalist are scared. They've overreached the future
[22:36.160 --> 22:43.120]  of the info war is in your hands. Join prison planet dot TV, download the thousands of special
[22:43.120 --> 22:48.200]  video reports, ebooks and more, and get them out to everyone you know. Continue to spread
[22:48.200 --> 22:53.540]  the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and every other globalist propaganda
[22:53.540 --> 22:58.920]  platform. We are going to use their system against them. The info war now goes into high
[22:58.920 --> 23:06.860]  gear. That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[23:06.860 --> 23:11.160]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[23:11.160 --> 23:15.980]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[23:15.980 --> 23:19.840]  makes the same light as a real television. So from outside, it looks like someone is
[23:19.840 --> 23:24.800]  home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[23:24.800 --> 23:30.080]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars cost far less than an alarm and is highly recommended
[23:30.080 --> 23:34.360]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake

[23:47.820 --> 23:57.320]  of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to fake TV.com, fake TV.com, the burglar
[23:57.320 --> 23:58.320]  deterrent.
[23:58.320 --> 24:25.560]  Okay, obviously a lot of you are going to want to respond to the NDAA. After I break
[24:25.560 --> 24:31.000]  it down, I'm gonna give the number out and hear from you on that subject or any other
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.340]  topic you wish to raise here. We are live, it is the second day of January 2012 on this
[24:38.340 --> 24:45.600]  Monday edition and it's gonna take some getting used to here obviously. Time is speeding up.
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.600]  Now we had seen some false alarms in the media saying that Obama had signed this about a
[24:50.600 --> 24:57.660]  week and a half ago, but those were not accurate. He did indeed sign it in private, the Associated
[24:57.660 --> 25:06.840]  Press reported, Saturday afternoon in Hawaii. That was in the evening Saturday here on the
[25:06.840 --> 25:10.520]  mainland and he signed it privately.
[25:10.520 --> 25:16.240]  He did not have a robo sign do it, a robot, a computerized signature which has been found
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.920]  to be unconstitutional, but so we're signing statements. And in the signing statement,
[25:21.920 --> 25:26.600]  you can read it at info.wars.com, drudgereport.com has been linked to our article about it with
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.600]  the signing statement added, but we actually put links to where Obama's lying in his signing
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.600]  statement.
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.400]  That's been on the Drudge Report since yesterday afternoon. It's now moved down the right
[25:35.400 --> 25:42.920]  hand side, halfway down, but it was the top story yesterday. Which again, I appreciate
[25:42.920 --> 25:49.240]  Drudge actually linking to a real article where we have links in Obama's statement when
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.040]  he says, I'm against the indefinite detention for citizens, but I'm still signing it.
[25:54.040 --> 25:59.540]  We have links to Carl Levin and other senators saying Obama demanded this be added. And we
[25:59.540 --> 26:08.000]  have links to him saying he wouldn't sign it with that in there. We just show the lies.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.160]  Now the question is why lie? I'm gonna explain that in a moment because when you understand
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.200]  this lie, and you peel back the layers of the onion, I've studied these people in depth,
[26:17.200 --> 26:26.040]  I know them. Then you understand how weak they are, how incredibly weak and pathetic
[26:26.040 --> 26:27.040]  they are.
[26:27.040 --> 26:30.960]  Now, you're like, well, then why are they running everything? Because we are laying
[26:30.960 --> 26:37.400]  down. I mean, if you didn't fight back against a seven year old, they could probably kill
[26:37.400 --> 26:41.480]  you. If you just laid there, they could get a sharp stick and stick it in your eye and
[26:41.480 --> 26:48.200]  cram it down into your brain probably. I mean, if you lay there in a bed of fire ants and
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.400]  don't get up, they can kill you, they're little bitty ants.
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.060]  And that's basically what it is. The New World Order are a bunch of ants and we just lay
[26:56.060 --> 27:00.720]  here with them crawling all over and stinging us. And I'm jumping up and down saying let's
[27:00.720 --> 27:09.200]  get up. But individually, I'm like a little lillipully, those little people that tie the
[27:09.200 --> 27:14.680]  giant down. I'm small, but together we're big.
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.080]  We are the body politic. The globalist are tiny, but together they're powerful and they
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.520]  know how to work together. That's what the Council on Foreign Relations and other people
[27:23.520 --> 27:29.240]  do. So I'll say it again in the new year, I'm very thankful to Matt Drudge and Joseph
[27:29.240 --> 27:32.620]  Curl and all the people over at the Drudge Report.
[27:32.620 --> 27:36.520]  Because it is the biggest news site in the world, undisputed, New York Times, others
[27:36.520 --> 27:45.500]  admit it. It drives more traffic than Twitter, Facebook combined. And all the other so-called
[27:45.500 --> 27:50.880]  conservative sites and libertarian and constitutional sites and even liberal sites mainly will not
[27:50.880 --> 27:53.440]  ever point out the emperor's wearing no clothes.
[27:53.440 --> 27:58.840]  And mfoawars.com is huge, Prison Planet's gigantic with the radio show and the YouTube
[27:58.840 --> 28:02.980]  channels and everything we do. We're big, we're one of the biggest things out there.
[28:02.980 --> 28:07.660]  But when it comes to internet, there's nothing even approaching Drudge.
[28:07.660 --> 28:15.120]  And this morning, I tuned in to talk radio and what were they talking about in San Antonio.
[28:15.120 --> 28:18.760]  And then I spent about an hour when I was on the treadmill listening to radio this morning
[28:18.760 --> 28:25.840]  instead of watching film, tuned to local radio and heard them talk about this on local 590.
[28:25.840 --> 28:33.840]  Two different shows, WOAI and 590 KLBJ here in town, and that was the two stations I listened
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.560]  to on the treadmill for 45 minutes, was because of Drudge.
[28:39.560 --> 28:43.900]  They were reading this and saying, should the government be able to secretly arrest
[28:43.900 --> 28:49.360]  citizens and have you disappear into a black hole? And they were reading from the article.
[28:49.360 --> 28:55.020]  I could care less they didn't give me any credit. All I care about is stopping this
[28:55.020 --> 28:59.960]  because I have children, because I want to be free, because I want to have a future.
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.920]  And I'm telling you, that's the power of the Drudge Report. This is not a bunch of rump
[29:04.920 --> 29:09.440]  kissing here. I'm gonna come back and actually get into the actual article and I'm signing
[29:09.440 --> 29:10.440]  it.
[29:10.440 --> 29:13.840]  It's just that Infowars, yeah, we can put an article out and sometimes it breaks into
[29:13.840 --> 29:19.420]  the quote mainstream and really goes mega viral. But with Drudge, it's guaranteed every
[29:19.420 --> 29:25.080]  time. And so it's the Drudge is saying the Emperor is not wearing clothes. Here's Obama
[29:25.080 --> 29:30.400]  lying and links to it. That's a big deal. So I just give thanks to that in the new year
[29:30.400 --> 29:36.080]  and give thanks that the Internet is still here in somewhat of a free position for now.
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.640]  But even AP Reuters, the top scientists that invented the Internet, all of them are public
[29:40.640 --> 29:46.080]  right now, even Politico, saying this SOPA bill is the end of the Internet and the end
[29:46.080 --> 29:49.960]  of free speech and the end of due process.
[29:49.960 --> 29:58.480]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.480 --> 30:04.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing nonhybrid
[30:04.560 --> 30:09.720]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[30:09.720 --> 30:13.720]  nonhybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[30:13.720 --> 30:18.080]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[30:18.080 --> 30:23.280]  So our friends at Solutions from Science put together the perfect mix of nonhybrid seeds.
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.320]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.840]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[30:32.840 --> 30:38.200]  modified in any way. You actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[30:38.200 --> 30:43.880]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[30:43.880 --> 30:55.560]  a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, nonhybrid seeds
[30:55.560 --> 30:59.440]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[32:15.000 --> 32:20.480]  oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret

[33:09.840 --> 33:16.800]  so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:16.800 --> 33:25.520]  All right, my friends, we are back live here. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm gonna
[33:25.520 --> 33:30.680]  give the number out here in just a few minutes. Coming up, it's littered with cuss words,
[33:30.680 --> 33:35.200]  but we're gonna bleep them out and air it on the nightly news this evening.
[33:35.200 --> 33:40.440]  Disturbing video that shows US soldiers blowing up a dog in Iraq for fun. There are hundreds
[33:40.440 --> 33:49.720]  of these videos. The US troops killing people's sheep, cows, horses for fun, blowing up people's
[33:49.720 --> 33:55.380]  dogs, killing puppies. And when we showed one of these videos a few years ago, a fake
[33:55.380 --> 34:00.720]  conservative who goes along with the entire system, Michelle Malkin, came out and said,
[34:00.720 --> 34:05.560]  I was a liar, and that it was a toy dog.
[34:05.560 --> 34:09.540]  Now clearly it was a puppy holding its feet up when you hold a mother scrub of the neck.
[34:09.540 --> 34:13.720]  Hopefully they kill it. The Marines had an investigation and confirmed it was real. And
[34:13.720 --> 34:18.040]  they didn't care. Malkin continued to say it wasn't real and that I was a liar. So when
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.200]  I ran into her, she had these local Republican college bloggers with her.
[34:23.200 --> 34:27.420]  They posed as if they were with us wearing mask and hats and screamed, kill Michelle
[34:27.420 --> 34:33.480]  Malkin. And then put out a blog saying, I said, kill her. And national so-called conservative
[34:33.480 --> 34:40.400]  radio went with, I'm calling for killing Michelle Malkin. And even the Denver Post ran with
[34:40.400 --> 34:41.400]  it.
[34:41.400 --> 34:48.560]  National TV ran with it. They sent extra out. It was clearly a psy-op and interviewed me
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.640]  there in Denver when I was at the DNC and said, why did you say kill her? And I showed
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.480]  him my own video and the reporter basically laughed at me and left and never even showed
[34:57.480 --> 35:01.000]  that. And I still get emails saying, how dare you say kill her?
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.200]  It's on the video. I'm screaming, how dare you say I'm a liar? They killed that dog.
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.640]  Admit it's real. It's been admitted it's real. And they just said, you know what? Kill Michelle
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.340]  Malkin. They screamed behind me, crouching down, psy-op experts. And then they all left
[35:15.340 --> 35:20.040]  with her. They all walked off, got in cars and left with her. That's what they think
[35:20.040 --> 35:21.040]  is cute.
[35:21.040 --> 35:27.460]  They think it's fun to deceive the public, to pose as conservatives so you can lead the
[35:27.460 --> 35:35.480]  opposition to the new world order as loyal opposition and lead it down a rat hole. And
[35:35.480 --> 35:38.800]  there's a new video out today. The only reason I'm covering it is it happened to be in the
[35:38.800 --> 35:39.800]  newspaper.
[35:39.800 --> 35:46.560]  I mean, I don't even, if I wanted to quote, just bash the troops, I could have these every
[35:46.560 --> 35:54.520]  day. Forget killing dogs. I've got British troops, US troops, contractors sitting off
[35:54.520 --> 36:00.320]  the side of highways, just shooting families in minivans and Lincoln town cars. And men
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.020]  and women rolling out, bleeding and shooting them and shooting women while they walk down
[36:05.020 --> 36:09.540]  a desert road with a four year old holding their hand and they laugh as the 50 cal blows
[36:09.540 --> 36:11.620]  her head off.
[36:11.620 --> 36:16.680]  And I've got them torturing children, just beating them and beating them. I think I oughta
[36:16.680 --> 36:21.800]  put a US troop compilation torture together. We'll do that. It'll take a few days to compile
[36:21.800 --> 36:27.480]  it though. Wednesday or Thursday on the nightly news, cuz we gotta bleep out all the cussing.
[36:27.480 --> 36:40.680]  We will leave in the pit demon noises though. The psycho masochistic demon surfacing. The
[36:40.680 --> 36:42.560]  demon surfacing part we'll leave in.
[36:42.560 --> 36:51.600]  Okay, I'm gonna leave all that in. You think I'm joking. We're gonna get it all together.
[36:51.600 --> 37:00.880]  We've heard those here before. Yes, yes. Bad little child. Naughty, naughty little boy.
[37:00.880 --> 37:07.880]  Guys, we have that in the computer. It's something like British troops beat children. Yeah, but
[37:07.880 --> 37:16.400]  you always hear that same noise. In these videos, American troops, British contractors,
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.720]  always when they're doing it, you hear the demonic entity.
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.860]  Come to the surface and it's having a vampire feeding frenzy. And it just totally takes
[37:26.860 --> 37:31.960]  them over. And boy, do we get death threats and everything when we play this stuff. Cuz
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.360]  they don't want that known. They call that anti US military. No, letting our military
[37:38.360 --> 37:46.880]  be taken over by a culture of demonic little creatures.
[37:46.880 --> 37:51.640]  That is destroying our military and our name worldwide, because this is all over TV worldwide.
[37:51.640 --> 37:58.320]  In fact, it's come out the CIA globally releases the photos and the videos of this, but only
[37:58.320 --> 38:04.680]  for foreign use for our future destruction. Domestically, you're not meant to see this.
[38:04.680 --> 38:12.400]  Remember, the United States is the main enemy. The Republic is the enemy. So while they use
[38:12.400 --> 38:19.240]  America to set up this world government, when they're done with us, the world's got to completely
[38:19.240 --> 38:21.000]  absolutely hate us.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.400]  Then they'll trigger a civil war here in the US with attempted gun confiscation. This is
[38:25.400 --> 38:31.760]  one of their main plans. Marching the police and military off to certain death in gun confiscation,
[38:31.760 --> 38:37.320]  certain death. And that's part of the plan. Then the I-4 UN global troops will come in.
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.540]  That's now in all the official FEMA Homeland Security documents. I used to have to get
[38:41.540 --> 38:47.240]  military officers like Colonel Craig Robertson, who's like, yeah, my nephew, after his graduation
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.020]  at West Point was sent to this base.
[38:49.020 --> 38:52.600]  And here's the names of the generals that said that during an emergency, they will use
[38:52.600 --> 38:56.180]  foreign troops to fight domestic terrorists. Now that's in the Washington Post and New
[38:56.180 --> 39:01.720]  York Times. Then yes, during crises, we will use foreign troops to deal with domestic
[39:01.720 --> 39:04.040]  problems.
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.880]  But that's after the police and military, many of which are honorable good people, are
[39:08.880 --> 39:14.160]  marched off against the general public. And of course, the breakdown of society will be
[39:14.160 --> 39:22.720]  so horrible at that point that many of the public will say, sure, arrest political dissidents.
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.840]  Just bring back the prosperity. And of course, when you go along with the tyranny, it won't
[39:28.840 --> 39:34.080]  bring back the prosperity. Just like I told you four years ago, the 2008 bailouts, I said,
[39:34.080 --> 39:35.480]  this is not gonna fix things.
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.680]  This is gonna make things worse. Next, they're gonna implode Europe. Then they're gonna take
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.400]  over with austerity, raising taxes, cutting benefits, not to pay public debts, but to
[39:44.400 --> 39:49.420]  pay for the bankers Ponzi scheme that they've gotten the public to sign on to, that they
[39:49.420 --> 39:52.080]  then spin and say is the public debt.
[39:52.080 --> 40:00.480]  And they have all these different media outlets running around, pushing it. Give me a document
[40:00.480 --> 40:03.600]  cam shot of this. Here's the cover of The Economist. If you're in storage, you'll see
[40:03.600 --> 40:10.520]  it on newsstands. Reviving the world economy, stand back, I'm a central banker. They take
[40:10.520 --> 40:18.200]  a famous, it's maybe a Rembrandt, a Dutch painting of a dissection of a corpse.
[40:18.200 --> 40:25.080]  I guess what they wrote Grey's Anatomy from. And he's got defibrillators about to start
[40:25.080 --> 40:29.880]  the debt economy's heart. And of course, they say the central bankers will fix it. And of
[40:29.880 --> 40:34.400]  course, it's all the exact names that engineered this. They're not gonna fix anything. Their
[40:34.400 --> 40:37.160]  takeover is working the way they want it to.
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.800]  But they're gonna bombard you with they'll fix it. Just give them total power. Again,
[40:42.800 --> 40:49.720]  this was an accurate Photoshop of a famous painting. They would all be vampires with
[40:49.720 --> 40:57.600]  straws drinking this person's blood, assanguinating him, sucking him dry. We'll be going over
[40:57.600 --> 40:59.800]  that a little bit later.
[40:59.800 --> 41:04.880]  Now continuing here, so I'm gonna get into the big news and then your calls. But we'll
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.960]  get to the troops killing him in a minute, but it all ties together. NDAA, the troops
[41:09.960 --> 41:17.640]  killing dogs, sheep, cows, horses, any chance they can. The army murdering them, again,
[41:17.640 --> 41:19.760]  people don't even get upset when it's a family.
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.600]  And you see them shooting the minivan off the road and the family falling out and people
[41:23.600 --> 41:28.320]  trying to grab their kids and the troops are laughing and then the gibbering starts. Like,
[41:28.320 --> 41:34.860]  whoa, demon just surfaced. It's in full feeding mode. It doesn't matter, every nationality.
[41:34.860 --> 41:43.720]  I've seen Russian troop stuff and it's the same gibbering noise. I mean, you can say
[41:43.720 --> 41:45.240]  there's no such thing as demons, whatever.
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.720]  A section of the brain that does that, okay? It's the same signature, it's the same thing.
[41:50.720 --> 41:53.280]  You wanna know what a psychopath's doing when they're torturing some three-year-old they
[41:53.280 --> 42:00.040]  kidnapped in some dungeon for six months? That's going on. And the psychopaths tell
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.440]  the psychiatrist about, they love sucking the essence out of it. They call it using
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.520]  someone up and they feed off the fear and the pain.
[42:11.520 --> 42:18.280]  It's an enjoyment. And so if you support the troops, you're supposed to say, this is wonderful.
[42:18.280 --> 42:21.440]  And defend it and say, they're just blowing off some steam. In fact, I remember that Rush
[42:21.440 --> 42:26.120]  Limbaugh clip where it came out about Abu Ghraib and torture of children. And he said,
[42:26.120 --> 42:32.000]  folks, you ever been under stress? You ever blown off some steam?
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.300]  Just type it in, Rush Limbaugh talks about torture is blowing off steam. And we're talking
[42:37.300 --> 42:41.840]  about four-year-olds in front of their parents being raped with objects dripping with battery
[42:41.840 --> 42:46.920]  acid. That's in the Army's own report. Just type in Army Abu Ghraib torture report. You'll
[42:46.920 --> 42:50.240]  get AP, MSNBC, the Army's report.
[42:50.240 --> 42:59.920]  It's 14 pages long, read it. 30 plus camps, 24-7 gang raping, torturing, murdering, killing.
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.080]  Pit demons, absolute pit of hell. This is what you've signed on to. Preemptive war,
[43:05.080 --> 43:10.520]  all of it. This is what happens. This is what the Nazis did. This is what the communist
[43:10.520 --> 43:18.480]  Chinese did and do. This is what the psycho armies want.
[43:18.480 --> 43:24.320]  And we've shown you internal memos, where in Texas they say, we're only hiring former
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.680]  military right now. Do not distribute this memo. Remember that we were sent that four
[43:28.680 --> 43:36.000]  months ago. It says right now we've been directed to only focus on military. I guess you might
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.740]  be able to get hired if you're not for military.
[43:37.740 --> 43:42.520]  But again, not just regular military. They have tests they give them that if you're damaged
[43:42.520 --> 43:56.200]  goods, you're gonna get the job. And you're gonna wage war against the American people.
[43:56.200 --> 44:00.840]  That's what they want. That's why I have the New York Times. Don't believe me, just type
[44:00.840 --> 44:03.360]  in scouts trained to fight terrorists and more.
[44:03.360 --> 44:09.920]  And the first line says, the 14 year olds trained to kill disgruntled veterans. In this
[44:09.920 --> 44:15.240]  drill, the Iraq vet is holed up. They quickly move in and take him out. You can see the
[44:15.240 --> 44:26.380]  photos of him training to kill veterans. Because you see, they want the PTSD 456 violent, fearless
[44:26.380 --> 44:28.800]  people to join their ranks.
[44:28.800 --> 44:33.480]  But they also know that there's gonna be giant groups who aren't turned over to evil, but
[44:33.480 --> 44:40.300]  are just as tough or tougher, who are gonna then fight the forces of evil. But there's
[44:40.300 --> 44:45.520]  also gonna be a third group, people that just go off the rails who don't get hired as cops
[44:45.520 --> 44:46.560]  or whatever.
[44:46.560 --> 44:49.880]  And that's like this guy. And when I get to after the Obama, I'll show you this article.
[44:49.880 --> 44:56.260]  We'll put it on screen. Massive manhunt after Ranger Slane and Rainier. We'll pull this
[44:56.260 --> 45:04.800]  up for later. And it says he is a former, several tours, what, Marines. And there was
[45:04.800 --> 45:07.080]  supposedly a shootout at a party.
[45:07.080 --> 45:11.300]  So he ran with his body armor and everything, reportedly to the local national park. They
[45:11.300 --> 45:16.640]  set up a roadblock. He got out, opened fire, more police showed up. And they sat there
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.560]  for hours while the park ranger bled to death because he was shooting at him. And now there's
[45:21.560 --> 45:27.180]  hundreds of federal police and others on the scene. And they're basically cowering a day
[45:27.180 --> 45:29.120]  later afraid to go after him.
[45:29.120 --> 45:35.640]  Okay, now what's gonna happen when you start secretly arresting people and you start going
[45:35.640 --> 45:40.880]  out trying to confiscate guns? 150 million, it's more like 200 million now. There's a
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.400]  massive armament going on. Millions of it, more like 2 million. They're saying a million
[45:45.400 --> 45:49.560]  and a half plus background checks in the month of December, all time record.
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.120]  Most sales are going on privately. You got 400 plus million guns out there. You've got
[45:54.120 --> 45:59.000]  all of this happening, all of this unfolding. And what's gonna happen when the government
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.360]  run by these criminal bankers who are sitting offshore, try to march the police and military
[46:03.360 --> 46:09.640]  off in asymmetrical warfare to take people's guns and to take political prisoners away?
[46:09.640 --> 46:18.360]  If 1% fights back, that's a million 500,000 of this guy. And I'm not saying he's a good
[46:18.360 --> 46:26.520]  guy. Late night party, got drunk, some kind of fight happened, shootout began. Just like
[46:26.520 --> 46:31.740]  Poplovski, drunk, gets home, has another pit bull urinating all over the carpet.
[46:31.740 --> 46:40.320]  His mother says, get out of here. She calls the police. He shoots and kills three of them.
[46:40.320 --> 46:45.520]  The point is, is that you train these people to just mow Iraqis down all day and laugh
[46:45.520 --> 46:51.480]  at dead kids and kill dogs and murder people and do all this. Of course, they've got record
[46:51.480 --> 46:54.560]  suicides, all time records. Of course, they're coming home.
[46:54.560 --> 47:00.420]  They had one Delta Force wing or squadron as they call them. What was it, five years
[47:00.420 --> 47:07.000]  ago in one weekend killed four families. Well, in one case, the family got away, he burned
[47:07.000 --> 47:13.800]  the house down. And when the police pulled up, this was in the news, they're outside
[47:13.800 --> 47:19.660]  Fort Benning, was flopping around foaming at the mouth.
[47:19.660 --> 47:23.920]  You pull up, the house is burning, the person is flopping around, they're so demonically
[47:23.920 --> 47:33.500]  possessed or whatever you wanna call it. I mean, look, you sow hell, you reap Armageddon.
[47:33.500 --> 47:38.880]  You get into evil and corruption and think it's cute and sexy and fun, it isn't. The
[47:38.880 --> 47:45.480]  wages of the New World Order is thermal nuclear war, biological weapons, imploding bank accounts,
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.360]  starvation, death, and everything that leads up to it.
[47:50.360 --> 47:57.320]  But I'll actually read over the article later. I mean, there's a photo of him here where
[47:57.320 --> 48:03.000]  he's got his different guns and his shirt off and he's the big tough guy. And now they're
[48:03.000 --> 48:10.400]  gonna send a bunch of other people just like him after him. And hundreds of local police
[48:10.400 --> 48:17.440]  and the feds are in the article admitting they're not going after him cuz they're scared.
[48:17.440 --> 48:20.960]  What you're scared of somebody that'll actually shoot back at you? You're scared of another
[48:20.960 --> 48:26.960]  psychopath? If it's hitting some old lady who you're taking the cash out of their purse,
[48:26.960 --> 48:32.160]  if it's hitting some 16 year old kid you found some marijuana on, so you go ahead and beat
[48:32.160 --> 48:35.440]  them up and send them to jail?
[48:35.440 --> 48:45.960]  You mean this is somebody like you? What do you think's gonna happen when they try to
[48:45.960 --> 48:52.680]  march you off against real Americans, real human beings? What do you think's gonna happen?
[48:52.680 --> 48:58.040]  You think 1% is gonna fight you? Numbers I've looked at and studied, about 10% are gonna
[48:58.040 --> 49:14.120]  fight. You know what 10% of 150 million is? You know what that is? It's 15 million. 15
[49:14.120 --> 49:19.640]  million people conservatively are gonna fight.
[49:19.640 --> 49:26.180]  And we have to overt this disaster. We do not want this to start up. We do not want
[49:26.180 --> 49:30.760]  this to happen because that's one of the false flags a new order can run, is marching the
[49:30.760 --> 49:38.800]  police and military off into a conflict and to create a civil war here in the United States.
[49:38.800 --> 49:42.040]  That's actually in the IMF and World Bank documents.
[49:42.040 --> 49:47.720]  All right, I was just gonna mention some of the news coming up. I've pretty much already
[49:47.720 --> 49:56.960]  started getting into it. And I've got page after page of notes on the NDAA and just how
[49:56.960 --> 50:00.100]  big it is and just how important it is.
[50:00.100 --> 50:04.200]  And just what it means to our society and how it's gonna be implemented and how it's
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.000]  gonna be rolled out. But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna reset cuz I'm pretty
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.360]  wound up from being gone a couple days. And I'm gonna come back and take your phone calls
[50:13.360 --> 50:17.800]  into the bottom of the hour, next hour. And then I'm gonna get into the NDAA in total
[50:17.800 --> 50:18.800]  detail.
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.120]  I did all this research last night and this morning and got all my ducks in a row. And
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.920]  tonight we're really having a special report on it that'll be highly produced where we've
[50:26.920 --> 50:36.680]  got all the clips and even more proof tonight on the nightly news. 7 o'clock Central. We'll
[50:36.680 --> 50:40.800]  take your calls on the NDAA, all of this.
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.460]  There's a lot of good police and military who aren't psychopaths, who haven't been twisted
[50:44.460 --> 50:49.360]  to the dark side. And we don't need to be like the American people in the police military,
[50:49.360 --> 50:56.080]  like pit bulls they put in an arena to kill each other or a cockfight. We need to be smarter
[50:56.080 --> 51:01.000]  than this and realize who the enemy is, the New World Order, the private banking cartel.
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.680]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[51:06.680 --> 51:11.200]  back on? If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because
[51:11.200 --> 51:15.760]  there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead. Here's
[51:15.760 --> 51:16.760]  why.
[51:16.760 --> 51:21.000]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.160]  of our oldest sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[51:26.160 --> 51:31.640]  when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes
[51:31.640 --> 51:35.960]  and produces electricity from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running
[51:35.960 --> 51:40.700]  quietly in your own home. Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never
[51:40.700 --> 51:45.320]  have to suffer through painful power outages again. When the power goes out this winter,
[51:45.320 --> 51:51.160]  you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com
[51:51.160 --> 51:58.560]  for more information. That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[51:58.560 --> 52:06.520]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[52:06.520 --> 52:11.040]  back on? If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because
[52:11.040 --> 52:15.360]  there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead. Here's
[52:15.360 --> 52:16.360]  why.
[52:16.360 --> 52:20.840]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.000]  of our oldest sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.460]  when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes
[52:31.460 --> 52:35.780]  and produces electricity from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running

[54:39.560 --> 54:41.520]  Coming up later in the next hour,
[54:41.520 --> 54:43.420]  Huntsman has put out a new attack
[54:43.420 --> 54:45.320]  ad on Ron Paul using clips of him
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.420]  on C-SPAN talking about a New World
[54:47.420 --> 54:49.200]  Order, Skull and Bones, and
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.480]  a clip from Endgame where he quotes
[54:51.480 --> 54:53.780]  George Bush Sr. He says George Bush
[54:53.780 --> 54:56.000]  Sr. called for a New World Order.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.680]  What's weird is they all call for
[54:57.680 --> 54:59.040]  a New World Order, Al Gore,
[54:59.040 --> 55:00.160]  Bill Clinton, all of them.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.560]  They say a New World Order is
[55:02.560 --> 55:04.280]  a global corporate government.
[55:04.280 --> 55:05.440]  And then Ron Paul says,
[55:05.440 --> 55:06.640]  I don't want a global corporate
[55:06.640 --> 55:08.040]  private government run by
[55:08.040 --> 55:09.500]  mega banks.
[55:09.500 --> 55:11.960]  And they go, my gosh, he's crazy.
[55:11.960 --> 55:13.880]  He's quoting George W.
[55:13.880 --> 55:15.280]  Bush, Herbert Walker Bush,
[55:15.280 --> 55:15.920]  calling for it.
[55:17.200 --> 55:19.460]  And they think their supporters
[55:19.460 --> 55:22.000]  are that big of an idiot, that as
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.520]  long as they sit there and deny
[55:24.520 --> 55:26.480]  that this stuff is going on,
[55:26.480 --> 55:28.760]  that people won't realize what's
[55:28.760 --> 55:29.760]  happening.
[55:29.760 --> 55:31.200]  Now, look, I can't play all of
[55:31.200 --> 55:32.520]  these here because there's
[55:32.520 --> 55:34.000]  cuss words on them and things.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.520]  And you've pretty much got to be
[55:35.520 --> 55:36.960]  watching to be able to see it.
[55:36.960 --> 55:40.080]  But here's the latest article out
[55:40.080 --> 55:43.560]  showing what the military is doing.
[55:44.360 --> 55:46.200]  Disturbing video that shows US
[55:46.200 --> 55:48.160]  soldiers blowing up a dog in Iraq
[55:48.160 --> 55:48.680]  for fun.
[55:49.320 --> 55:50.960]  And again, this is not the majority
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.720]  of the troops.
[55:51.720 --> 55:53.160]  But it's like when you see that
[55:53.160 --> 55:54.640]  Apache helicopter shoot up that
[55:54.640 --> 55:55.440]  car full of kids.
[55:55.440 --> 55:56.620]  They kind of laugh about it and
[55:56.620 --> 55:58.000]  say, well, shouldn't bring kids to
[55:58.000 --> 55:58.520]  a battle.
[55:58.520 --> 55:59.280]  It wasn't a battle,
[55:59.280 --> 56:00.200]  it was middle of a city.
[56:00.200 --> 56:01.880]  It was Reuters reporters with their
[56:01.880 --> 56:02.380]  kids.
[56:03.280 --> 56:04.640]  And then people defended that on
[56:04.640 --> 56:05.400]  the radio.
[56:05.400 --> 56:07.000]  They defend torture on the radio.
[56:07.600 --> 56:10.280]  Well, this is what torture is.
[56:10.280 --> 56:10.980]  Let's go ahead and
[56:10.980 --> 56:11.840]  play part of that clip.
[56:15.280 --> 56:17.340]  And again, there's just a dog,
[56:17.340 --> 56:18.360]  it's in a city,
[56:18.360 --> 56:19.800]  the side of the road.
[56:19.800 --> 56:21.520]  They've put some food out for
[56:21.520 --> 56:22.640]  it next to a bomb.
[56:22.640 --> 56:25.440]  And the audio is not good, but
[56:25.440 --> 56:28.200]  you can hear them talking about it.
[56:28.200 --> 56:29.360]  Come on, puppy, puppy.
[56:30.960 --> 56:31.760]  They make sweet,
[56:31.760 --> 56:33.280]  fake sweet noises to it.
[56:35.680 --> 56:36.960]  Come on, kid, get in the car.
[56:39.600 --> 56:41.040]  And cousins coming up.
[56:41.040 --> 56:42.080]  They start celebrating and
[56:42.080 --> 56:42.720]  getting off on it.
[56:42.720 --> 56:43.640]  Let's go ahead.
[56:43.640 --> 56:44.440]  That's enough right there.
[56:44.440 --> 56:45.520]  So they blow up the dog and
[56:45.520 --> 56:46.840]  have a big celebration.
[56:46.840 --> 56:49.160]  Now, here's another video
[56:49.160 --> 56:50.680]  that I mentioned where Michelle
[56:50.680 --> 56:52.880]  Malkin and others said I was a liar.
[56:54.240 --> 56:55.960]  In fact, some blogs and groups,
[56:55.960 --> 56:57.880]  neocon groups, said that we might
[56:57.880 --> 56:59.200]  have even produced it.
[56:59.200 --> 57:01.560]  That it was a robot dog.
[57:01.560 --> 57:02.840]  Anybody who's ever had a dog knows
[57:02.840 --> 57:03.920]  you pick one up by the back of
[57:03.920 --> 57:04.820]  the scrub of the neck.
[57:04.820 --> 57:06.360]  It pulls its little legs up.
[57:06.360 --> 57:07.640]  You can see it's a real puppy.
[57:09.080 --> 57:10.120]  And they throw it off a cliff.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.320]  And the Marines did investigation
[57:13.320 --> 57:14.400]  said yes, it was true.
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.040]  But notice, people don't get upset
[57:16.040 --> 57:17.480]  about Iraqi kids being killed.
[57:17.480 --> 57:19.960]  That's manly and good.
[57:21.840 --> 57:24.240]  It's a dog because dogs haven't
[57:24.240 --> 57:26.320]  been dehumanized yet.
[57:26.320 --> 57:28.000]  There's more value in an animal in
[57:28.000 --> 57:28.920]  our culture.
[57:28.920 --> 57:30.800]  My dad was coming over to do some
[57:30.800 --> 57:32.680]  22 shooting with my children
[57:32.680 --> 57:33.840]  yesterday.
[57:33.840 --> 57:34.440]  And I said, well,
[57:34.440 --> 57:35.440]  everything's closed today.
[57:35.440 --> 57:36.800]  But I said, will you go to Walmart
[57:36.800 --> 57:38.400]  and buy some of those box targets,
[57:38.400 --> 57:39.800]  those styrofoam targets,
[57:39.800 --> 57:41.760]  with squirrels and stuff on them?
[57:41.760 --> 57:43.160]  And he said, yeah.
[57:43.160 --> 57:44.320]  And when he was leaving Walmart,
[57:44.320 --> 57:45.720]  he got lectured by the old lady.
[57:45.720 --> 57:47.160]  Please don't shoot squirrels and
[57:47.160 --> 57:47.680]  crows.
[57:47.680 --> 57:48.640]  And he said, well,
[57:48.640 --> 57:49.760]  it's for target practice.
[57:50.760 --> 57:51.520]  And the point is,
[57:51.520 --> 57:52.680]  she had to lecture him.
[57:52.680 --> 57:54.800]  This is all this anti-gun culture
[57:54.800 --> 57:56.320]  that's out there.
[57:56.320 --> 57:57.280]  But side issue,
[57:57.280 --> 57:58.960]  they care about animals, but
[57:58.960 --> 58:00.480]  not about humans.
[58:00.480 --> 58:02.040]  That's part of the dehumanization.
[58:02.040 --> 58:03.600]  Let's go to this next clip.
[58:03.600 --> 58:05.240]  Here they are with the puppy,
[58:05.240 --> 58:06.640]  enjoying themselves and
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.160]  throwing it off the cliff.
[58:08.160 --> 58:09.880]  Cute little puppy.
[58:09.880 --> 58:13.960]  So cute, so cute little puppy.
[58:13.960 --> 58:19.760]  And then there's a celebration, but
[58:19.760 --> 58:23.000]  we can't play the cussing.
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.520]  So, again, face your crimes.
[58:26.520 --> 58:28.040]  You want preemptive war?
[58:28.040 --> 58:29.240]  You want police state?
[58:29.240 --> 58:30.760]  The Constitution's bad?
[58:30.760 --> 58:32.280]  Enjoy the fruits.
[58:32.280 --> 58:33.600]  Abortion isn't bad?
[58:33.600 --> 58:34.920]  Enjoy the fruits.
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.280]  Vaccines aren't bad?
[58:36.280 --> 58:37.440]  Enjoy the fruits.
[58:37.440 --> 58:38.480]  We'll be back with your calls.
[58:38.480 --> 58:44.720]  This is GCN,
[58:44.720 --> 58:47.240]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.240 --> 58:53.000]  When you're out on the road,
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.400]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[58:57.800 --> 58:59.520]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[58:59.520 --> 59:01.480]  you'll be glad you were wearing
[59:01.480 --> 59:02.920]  diamond gussets.
[59:02.920 --> 59:04.800]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[59:04.800 --> 59:11.600]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[59:11.600 --> 59:15.680]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[59:15.680 --> 59:20.000]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.760]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch,
[59:22.760 --> 59:24.640]  where you need it most.
[59:24.640 --> 59:29.760]  Blue diamond gusset's got it, others don't.
[59:29.760 --> 59:31.880]  We turn jeans inside out.
[59:31.880 --> 59:33.680]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[59:33.680 --> 59:36.520]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[59:45.880 --> 59:49.400]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[59:53.560 --> 59:55.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:55.880 --> 01:00:05.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.640]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.440]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.200]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.800]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:23.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.680]  All right, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.840]  It's gonna be open phones.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.640]  I haven't even gotten into the NDAA being signed,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.760]  how the media, so-called media is trying to spin it.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.240]  Why Obama demanded the indefinite detention
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.600]  of citizens being there.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.600]  That's tip of the iceberg, by the way.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.560]  And then claimed he was against it, but still signed it.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.320]  I'm gonna break this down, it's key.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.520]  Coming up bottom of the hour,
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.240]  then we'll get into the latest on the austerity moves,
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.880]  the central bank takeover, some new world order quotes.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.840]  I am wound up today.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.800]  And I'm gonna tie it into the record gun sales
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.520]  that are taking place, and how the police can't even deal
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:06.840]  with one suspect who they believe shot this park ranger.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.920]  And again, it's like, well, why would he shoot friends
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:14.080]  at a party, allegedly, this veteran of two tours in Iraq,
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.520]  and then run off and just shoot a park ranger
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.440]  like they were nothing at a checkpoint to stop him?
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.560]  Because human life means nothing to him.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.640]  That's what's scary, a lot of these guys,
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.240]  people got screwed up in one tour in World War II.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.080]  You only serve one tour because after that,
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.200]  it got bad for most people.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.760]  Vietnam, maybe two, three tours if you volunteered.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.320]  I know people that have served seven or eight tours,
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.920]  and they get addicted to it because they're not living
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.680]  until, it's like the hurt locker, that's very accurate
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.160]  until they're in super danger.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.120]  Some people can deal with it.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.960]  A lot of them can't.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.720]  They kill themselves, they kill their families,
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.800]  or they kill cops.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.520]  And what's gonna happen is the system's gonna start
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.400]  harassing veterans more now, and it's gonna be like
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.080]  sticking your hand down a badger hole,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.680]  and it's gonna get worse and worse and worse,
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.520]  which is exactly what the globalists want.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.440]  The social engineers, they know what they're doing.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.720]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.680]  Tim in Deutschland, you're on the air from Germany.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.520]  Hello, happy new year from Germany.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.800]  Thanks for your work, Alex.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.640]  Thank you.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.120]  Yeah, I want to endorse many of the perspectives
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.760]  of you give over the years in your programs
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.840]  from the German perspective.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.360]  What people in the United States should realize is
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.120]  we have the same stuff going here.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.440]  The rules, the attempts to control the internet,
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.400]  bringing drones and UAVs into civil airspace,
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.280]  the same stuff is happening here in parallel.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.960]  It's happening in Germany that they bring the UAVs now.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.040]  They just do it by the stroke of a pen.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.880]  They say it's just a piece of law
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.520]  concerning the aviation authorities,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.400]  but these drones can survey us, they can spy on us,
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.720]  and they just bring them on.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.160]  Yeah, it's the unelected bureaucracies
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.000]  that on their boards have these internationalist
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.840]  that The Economist magazine calls for,
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.680]  the technocrats, to take over.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.880]  And they're preparing for war against us
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.320]  because that's the new economy, that's the new system.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.800]  But no amount of drones and tinker toys,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.520]  they've got military drones with infrared
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.440]  over this guy out in Washington State at Mount Rainier.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.160]  And okay, drones, hundreds of militarized police,
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.920]  and they can't stop one guy.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.840]  It's pathetic.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.040]  And the same thing is happening even with Ron Paul.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.160]  You regularly mentioned the Spiegel,
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.600]  which is a really big German magazine.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.040]  The same stuff in ignorance towards Ron Paul,
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040]  the total absence of journalism
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.680]  is present here with him as well.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.800]  They talk about long gone Rick Perry
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.840]  and how influential he was in his campaign,
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.200]  and they talk about Michel Bachmann
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.000]  and identify the Tea Party only with these stooges
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.040]  and completely ignore what Ron Paul says
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.320]  or how many Germans, because they're afraid
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.720]  many Germans would approach the non-interventionalism.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.520]  And even in Spiegel, it's completely synchronized
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.600]  to what I see on Politico and other US news.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.960]  That's a good word, global standardization, synchronization.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.560]  This is the global government.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.880]  Everything we do is under UN UNESCO, US, EU.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.040]  It's all standardized.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.560]  It's the same groups everywhere.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.040]  We had this, we used the attack on the internet,
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.080]  now with SOPA.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.160]  We used to have this Bilderberg and CFR plant mole
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.760]  of a German Secretary of Defense to Gutenberg.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.360]  And the guy was doing his PhD on a pretty much rip-off-
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.680]  I tell you what, Tim, I want you to recap what you're saying,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.840]  finish your point when we come back.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.880]  I'm gonna play this new Ron Paul attack ad,
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.280]  then we'll finish it with Tim.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.560]  Then we'll go to Carol, John, Rudy, Janice, and others,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.720]  wide open phones.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.400]  I haven't even gotten into NDAA.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.600]  This is key.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.240]  What's coming up, call your friends and family,
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.240]  tell them tune in right now.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.000]  Tim, stay there, coming back to you.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.080]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.440]  double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.720]  Number two, our new energy czar wants
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.360]  to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.160]  you to have.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.160]  It's true, total government control
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.000]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.760]  is coming.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.160]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.440]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.080]  is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.240]  Number four, dangerous weather is always
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.640]  a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.240]  Every year, thousands of families
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.360]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.080]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.840]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.040]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.320]  of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.480]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.240]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.520]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:01.360]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.040]  Hi, folks.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.920]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.240]  to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.960]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.560]  The Cowbend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.680]  of dollars and give you good, old-fashioned real soaps
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.880]  that are triple concentrated and twice as good
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.320]  as what you're using now.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.200]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.520]  that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.960]  or antibacterials.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.200]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.680]  that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.960]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.000]  If you want something better, if you want something
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.400]  you've never had before, you have
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.200]  to do something you've never done before.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.120]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.320]  or see Cowbend on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:53.320]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.040]  or see Cowbend on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.160]  in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.360]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.680]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.560]  and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.760]  to pay attention.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.040]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.520]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.360]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.920]  constructing world government.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.840]  They're asking for more matches.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.320]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.400]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.880]  And right now in Washington, DC, we
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.560]  have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.320]  at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.960]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.760]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.840]  All right, we're going to continue with your calls
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.320]  here in just a moment.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.760]  Calls from the United States, Australia, Germany,
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.080]  you name it.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.200]  Here's an article up at infowars.com right now.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.160]  Obama's NDAA signing statement is meaningless.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.160]  Administration itself demanded power
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.440]  to detain American citizens without trial.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.920]  It's an article by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.160]  I worked on the article a bit with Paul this morning.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.000]  But Paul does the lion's share of the work.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.760]  Appreciate him including me in the article.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.520]  And it just breaks down the facts.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.560]  Very important article.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.760]  I want to get to this article and then back to your calls.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.000]  We had a caller from Germany who was making the point
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.640]  that there's totally synchronized drones
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.960]  over the population, the checkpoints, the cameras,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.920]  the demonization of Ron Paul.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.000]  Same thing worldwide.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.560]  They're demonizing Ron Paul in Australia.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.800]  I've seen articles because they're scared
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.680]  of those ideas picking up.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.680]  2006, 2008, 2011, our intel from three separate
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:17.320]  Bilderberg meetings, was they're scared of Ron Paul.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.480]  Not that he's going to win from their perspective,
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.880]  but because he's winning by resisting.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.520]  By getting these ideas out,
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.600]  it's like holy water to Nosferatu.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.000]  That they are scared to death of this.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.400]  Because the idea, the anti-venom to what this
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.200]  New World Order Cobra has pumped into us is out there.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.440]  And if we discover it, the sword of truth,
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.400]  of common sense, of free market constitutionalism,
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.000]  bye-bye New World Order.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.240]  It's been the New World Order with NAFTA, GATT,
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.360]  all these wars that's bankrupted us, that's destroyed us.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.040]  And now here's an article, Huntsman releases
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.600]  tacky glib Twilight Zone attack ad.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.600]  I would say desperate Huntsman launches Ron Paul attack ad,
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.200]  claims New World Order doesn't exist.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.480]  But Huntsman releases tacky glib Twilight Zone attack ad
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.080]  in desperate bid to steal Ron Paul voters.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.280]  If Ron Paul's foreign policy positions
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.960]  are out of the Twilight Zone, that's what the ad does,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.640]  why does Paul get the most support from US military?
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.800]  By the way, I remember in 1998,
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.240]  they ran ads Texas wired against him,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.440]  Twilight Zone with Twilight Zone music and going,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.080]  he wants kids to use drugs.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.520]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.920]  He wants to get rid of the federal government.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.000]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  All misrepresenting what he says, misrepresent,
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.960]  I mean, I saw an article in the Associated Press
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.960]  this morning saying, Ron Paul believes
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.760]  there shouldn't be a space program.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.920]  No, Ron Paul said it's not constitutional
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.560]  to pay for this giant space program.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.360]  And that private corporations should get into the business.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.760]  We'd probably be much more advanced if they had.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120]  And of course, they're weaponizing space.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.560]  But continuing here, Huntsman has released this ad
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.600]  and either tonight or tomorrow night,
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.560]  I wanna go back and find George Herbert Walker Bush,
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.240]  Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Hermann von Rompi, head of the EU,
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.080]  all of them calling for a new world order
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.320]  and then saying that means global government.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.440]  So here's Ron Paul in Endgame saying,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.520]  yeah, they want a new world order.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.880]  That's just what George Herbert Walker Bush called for.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.760]  And so they have these clips from Endgame
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.160]  and from C-SPAN and places,
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.400]  and they're airing this spending millions of dollars
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.440]  in Iowa acting like he's crazy.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.760]  Look, he's crazy.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.680]  He says there's a global technocratic system
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.000]  run by mega banks being set up.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.120]  We should get rid of the Federal Reserve
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.600]  and get our sovereignty back.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.320]  Everybody knows that's nuts.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.320]  When all Ron Paul is doing is reporting what's in the news.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.000]  Yeah, he warned exactly what was coming 30 years ago.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.360]  He was way ahead of the curve,
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.560]  but now we're in this paradox where it's all happening.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.600]  I mean, I saw this weekend dozens of articles
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.000]  saying Ron Paul's nuts.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.320]  He thinks they're gonna put troops on the streets.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.720]  There's already troops on the streets
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.120]  all over the country and TSA checkpoints.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.560]  They're announcing they're gonna use military domestically.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.280]  It's in all the military publications.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.160]  But these reporters talk to their readers
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.720]  and viewers and listeners like they're idiots.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.080]  Every once in a while I'll call into local talk radio
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.440]  when they're talking about issues
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.200]  or when they're reading one of my articles.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.760]  And they always, on two different talk stations
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.920]  I've called into,
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.160]  they'll always play black helicopter noises
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.400]  or X-Files music or Empire Strikes Back battle theme
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.040]  and laugh at me while I'm talking.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.800]  But I let them do it and still get the info out
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.360]  because then most of the callers call in and add more data.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.560]  But, oh, look, he's telling us exactly what's happening.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.200]  Oh my gosh, he's incredibly accurate.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.160]  It all came true.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.480]  Let's not say, man, we better listen to this guy.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.320]  Let's attack him.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this new desperate,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.320]  this is Huntsman, this is a guy that works for Obama.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.360]  This is a big globalist.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.360]  This is a guy CNN, MSNBC love.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.560]  And here he is implying Ron Paul lives in the Twilight Zone.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.040]  No, Ron Paul lives in the real world.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.160]  And the public's starting to live in the real world
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.000]  and starting to go,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.840]  wait, you're saying there's no New World Order,
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.680]  but I've heard all these leaders call for one.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.960]  Ron Paul isn't allowed to say,
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.440]  hey, America should be run by Americans
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.440]  and not some offshore banks.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.760]  Hey, Ron Paul said NAFTA and GATT would be bad.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.880]  He's not a kook.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.440]  Remember, they called Ross Perot a kook.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.160]  All they've got's name calling
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.160]  and they count on you being childlike.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.160]  Here's the clip of the Twilight Zone ad.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.680]  ["The Twilight Zone Theme Song"]
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.360]  Ron Paul chronicles.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.720]  The assumption is that this guy is like your crazy uncle,
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.160]  but you never expected your crazy uncle to get this far.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.440]  The problem with him is that he's got
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.160]  some very sound points, but then he's kind of,
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.000]  I don't know, in other areas, scary.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.120]  All I can say is, you know,
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.160]  people have written about this and the Skull of the Homes
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.320]  is a secret order of Yale and then the proposition
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.520]  is that people are their groom
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.640]  for the trilateral commission and the CFR
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.400]  and therefore they will then be in positions
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.320]  of great influence in our government.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.760]  President Bush said that the New World Order
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.360]  was in tune and that's what they were working for.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.080]  600,000 Americans died in the senseless civil war.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.400]  You buy the slaves in the Middle East.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.440]  How much would that cost
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.920]  compared to killing 600,000 Americans?
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.480]  If you look at the history, you'll find out
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.760]  that Hamas was encouraged and really started by Israel.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.400]  Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us?
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.840]  They attack us because we've been over there.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.400]  We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.160]  Are you suggesting we invited the 9-11 attack, sir?
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.320]  The Israelis are there.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.880]  The United States is there.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.800]  All these countries, China has nuclear weapons.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.680]  Why wouldn't it be natural that they might want a weapon?
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.720]  There'd be, internationally, they'd be given more respect.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.040]  ["The Twilight Zone Theme Song"]
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.240]  Tune in next week for more of
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.040]  ["The Twilight Zone Theme Song"]
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.000]  the Ron Paul Chronicles.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.760]  Okay.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.120]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.320]  Herats?
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.840]  Reuters?
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.960]  Jerusalem Post?
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.160]  I mean, you can type in Israel created Hamas
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.280]  into a search engine, you'll get UPI?
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.640]  Israel admits that.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.760]  Anyone watching that in Israel
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.760]  knows that in 1973, as a counterbalance to Hezbollah,
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.600]  that's the Iranian-backed group, the Shiite-backed group,
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.280]  that Israel created Hamas.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.120]  Ron Paul could have gone further.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.320]  Israel staged terror attacks against itself,
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.400]  against its own public.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.880]  Jerusalem Post, Herats, UPI.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.800]  I mean, just type in Israel created fake al-Qaeda.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.080]  Staged attacks, I mean,
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.640]  everything he said there was true.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.800]  Every little piece was real, but they think you're stupid.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.600]  They think you're idiots.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.720]  They think you don't know about how the world works.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.920]  Oh, Ron Paul's a kook.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.320]  They had a clip from 20 years ago of him on TV
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.280]  being asked about Skull and Bones.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.760]  And he says, yeah, it's a secret society at Yale.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.760]  What, you've had four presidents come from there?
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.440]  A bunch of secretary of states?
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.120]  These are gangs, these are mafias,
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.400]  these are secret societies.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.880]  The CFR, Trilateral Commission,
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.240]  openly called for rural government,
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.280]  but you're not supposed to talk about it?
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.920]  Every, I mean, we could dissect that clip.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.760]  We won't have time to do it today.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.480]  We'll do it maybe tomorrow night on the news
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.400]  and have it for Wednesday on the show,
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.120]  where we could go through and show you articles
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.160]  and documents and video clips.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.040]  In fact, call Rob Dewan here for me real quick, please.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.360]  We can do part one tonight.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.920]  The problem is every five seconds of the ad,
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.000]  I can back up what he's saying.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.640]  But we could just at least,
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.960]  hey, dude, come on in, bro.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.160]  Have you seen this ad attacking Ron Paul?
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.240]  I just heard it.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.080]  Okay, well, the point is,
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.480]  I know I wanted to get out of here early today.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.560]  I wanted to shoot the show and tape it so doing it live,
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.720]  but obviously today or tomorrow, whatever.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.960]  We need to show where they make fun of him
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.360]  about New World Order and show Herman.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.200]  We already have the clips.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.920]  Herman Von Rompie calling for New World Order
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.280]  world government.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.960]  We need to show British Prime Minister calling for it.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.960]  We show Herbert Walker, like show the clip and then go,
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.400]  oh, but here he is saying,
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.560]  we're not supposed to talk about it?
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.680]  What's Twilight Zone is that they think
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.600]  their viewers are stupid.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.600]  And then he's got the part,
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.160]  we'll just show two parts tonight.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.280]  He's got the part where they go,
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.920]  oh my gosh, he thinks Israel founded Hamas.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.600]  Just type in Israel created Hamas.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.320]  You'll get UPI, Reuters, AP.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.560]  But more importantly, they'll say,
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.440]  oh, well, that's anti-Semitic Reuters,
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.080]  because we all know they're evil.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.720]  Show them something like Jerusalem Post or Herats.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.640]  I know it's in both those.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.240]  And there's been Knesset debates
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.600]  where they gripe at people for creating it and all that.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.640]  And then go one further, the headlines,
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.360]  Israel created fake Al Qaeda to attack themselves.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.680]  That's in the Israeli papers.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.720]  That's why the Israelis are rioting over there.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.840]  The media acts like all the Israelis want war
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840]  and love the tyranny.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.840]  They have a government staging stuff on them as well.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.440]  And then funding terror groups or letting terrorists in
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.200]  as a pretext to keep control.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.960]  Don't you see the paradigm, dude?
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.920]  I know you see it well, okay, I'm ranting.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.080]  All right, thank you so much, good job.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:37.920]  Unbelievable.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.240]  Let's go back to the caller in Germany,
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.240]  then I promise I'm coming back with more of your calls here.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.600]  Tim, finish up the point you were making
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.760]  before the last break.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.480]  Well, what I want to do rather is do an appeal
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.480]  to the citizens.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.440]  Guys, preserve your right, defend the liberty you have.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.000]  Currently resistance and success against the globalists
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:55.960]  comes cheap.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.320]  Worse, it's gonna happen to you as being ridiculed.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.000]  It will be worse soon if you do not all kick
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.040]  into high gear.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.440]  Call a politician each day or a representative,
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.000]  inform anyone you find.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.200]  Being ridiculed is probably the worst that's gonna happen.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.200]  But soon, it could be with NDDA that looks like
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.240]  the enabling acts in Germany.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.200]  The Hitler was only elected, but he wasn't in power
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.640]  and he wasn't the dictator, he wasn't elected dictator.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.480]  He became one.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.200]  He grabbed the power, just the same stuff
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.560]  that could and likely is to be happening
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.040]  in the United States currently.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.080]  And you were saying you're seeing the same parallels
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.360]  in Germany?
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.920]  The same, the media is completely synchronized.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.880]  You know, I had you hold so long, we're coming back to you.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.080]  I'm gonna give you two minutes on the other side,
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.680]  then I'm gonna get to everybody else's calls
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]  who's on the board.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.640]  Then I'm getting into NDAA.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.480]  I was up late last night, woke up middle of the night.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.160]  I've got all these notes written up.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.640]  Key report at 40 after exactly.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.360]  I'm going to the NDAA report in 20 minutes,
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.960]  but your calls are straight ahead.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.960]  Stay there, Tim.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.080]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnebel from Midas Resources.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.760]  As you know, the federal government spending
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.560]  is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.880]  of the spending policy.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.680]  European government and central bank spending policies
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.040]  have put the European Union on the brink of collapse.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.040]  What are you doing right now
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.560]  to protect yourself financially?
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.040]  Are your assets working for you or against you?
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.320]  One thing is certain, having physical possession
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.160]  of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.400]  what happens to our economy or the dollar,
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.320]  your investment will never be worthless.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.120]  And it'll protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.720]  If you've been thinking about investing
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.920]  in physical possession of precious metals
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.560]  or having an IRA in precious metals, I can help.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.280]  Call me today, Peter Kronschnebel at 800-686-2237,
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.680]  extension 108.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.600]  And I'll take the time to personally put together
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.360]  a portfolio designed to protect
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.720]  what you've worked so hard for.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.080]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.360]  You've worked hard your whole life
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.800]  and I wanna work hard for you.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:00.440]  Call Peter at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.040]  Guys, did you know that starting in your early 30s,
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.760]  your testosterone drops one to 3% each year?
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.360]  By 50, you may have already lost half your testosterone.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.800]  That could explain a lot, like your low energy,
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.360]  muscle turning to fat and a low drive in your romantic life.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.160]  Discover Ageless Male,
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.040]  the first and only all natural supplement
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.240]  that's clinically proven to boost your testosterone levels
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.600]  by 61% and still within healthy, normal ranges.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.800]  And when your testosterone levels are healthy,
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.560]  you can feel more like you did 20 years ago.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.200]  That energy, that focus and concentration,
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.120]  that passion in your love life.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.040]  Be the man you used to be.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.000]  Call now to try Ageless Male risk-free.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.840]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.880]  1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.680]  Don't wait another day.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:57.240]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.240]  1-800-497-8345.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.120]  You don't need me to tell you
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.640]  that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.200]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.480]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.280]  between the forces of freedom
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.080]  and those who love darkness, bondage and enslavement.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.560]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.920]  But take heart for every action.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.360]  There is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.040]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.800]  admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.640]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.360]  The globalists are scared.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.680]  They've overreached.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.160]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.840]  We are going to use their system against them.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.160]  The info war now goes into high gear.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.800]  If you're taking one, two, five
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.720]  or more nutritional supplements, please stop.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.520]  Simplify your supplementation with BioSuperfood,
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.320]  the most advanced nutritional whole food supplement
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.160]  you can buy.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.920]  Men, women, children, even Olympic athletes
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.280]  the world over have discovered BioSuperfood
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.920]  from bioage.com.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.360]  And now take just one nutritional supplement
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.280]  instead of many.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:25.120]  The BioSuperfood formulas are whole food products
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.960]  composed with four of the most nutrient dense algae
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.920]  found on earth.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.440]  BioSuperfood for the brain helps with focus,
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.840]  memory, clarity and mood.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.360]  If you can increase brain health,
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.520]  the rest of the body is a no brainer.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.080]  BioSuperfood has zero toxicity
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.880]  and is safe for you and your family.

[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.520]  That's 877-288-9116.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.320]  BioAge, the age of advanced organics.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.600]  As we've been trying on the wine break,
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:08.400]  much too long to prevail.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.920]  The Babylon system is the vampire
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.480]  sucking the children.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.240]  The Babylon system is the vampire
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:22.160]  sucking the blood of the children day by day.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.560]  Sucking the children day by day.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.280]  All right, I'm gonna get to the calls.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.880]  I'm just really wound up here today.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.520]  Obviously NDAA is now law,
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.800]  but they pass laws that black people weren't humans
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.360]  in this country.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.880]  They pass laws in other countries
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.040]  that they could secretly arrest you
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.240]  and disappear you to a camp.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.760]  And Tim in Germany was bringing up the enabling act.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.680]  And yes, Hitler was what elected president.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.600]  And then he blew up his own Reichstag building
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.600]  and had Kaiser Wilhelm sign over the chancellorship to him.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.400]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.120]  And then that he unified the presidency
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.320]  and the chancellorship into the fuhrer.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.680]  And then it still took him from February 27th
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.040]  when he did that right through four or five years
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.360]  to really get dictator powers going.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.920]  You live in Germany, is that historically accurate, Tim?
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.680]  Well, the dates were a little bit later.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.760]  He was a chancellor, you were right on that.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:25.440]  But what I can tell you is I'm only 40 years old
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.840]  or I'll be coming this year.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.840]  But what I can tell you the German,
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.640]  we always were taught in school.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.280]  It was close to indoctrination,
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.760]  but then because of what happened in the Third Reich,
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.240]  I must say was partly okay.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.640]  But we've always taught the question was,
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.520]  how could you allow that to happen?
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.560]  And think about yourselves, the listeners.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.600]  What will you be asked in 15, 10, five years
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  if it's gonna be fast, maybe less?
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.320]  Or 20 years, what are your children,
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.120]  what are your grandchildren gonna ask you?
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.280]  What did you do back then?
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.200]  What did you do to prevent this from happening
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.920]  that could be happening?
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.680]  And that these people are madmen.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:03.720]  You can see that bioengineering viruses,
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.240]  they genetically modify stuff
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.400]  that shouldn't be genetically modified.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.000]  And they could bring anything up on us this year
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.600]  because they seem to be prone on 2012
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.600]  as a year of change for them.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.720]  And I don't say it is likely,
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.920]  but everybody should be prepared for everything globally.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.920]  They could just promote on CNN
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.080]  that the aliens have contacted us and tried to export us.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.560]  And because of that, they could release the flu.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.720]  They could do anything.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.120]  These are madmen.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.520]  Exactly, exactly, because they're able to put out a big hoax,
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.080]  have all their corporate liars put out a unified fraud.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.640]  And then you're always battling the fraud
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.400]  even though you prove it a lie later.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.160]  It's just accepted as the pretext.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.800]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.280]  Here's a breakdown from the Future of Freedom Foundation.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.360]  And the presidential election held March 13th, 1932.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.560]  There were four candidates.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:00.760]  The incumbent, Field Marshall, Paul von Hindenburg,
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.920]  Hitler, and two minor candidates.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.920]  Ernst Thielemann and Theodor Duesenberg.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.880]  The results were Hindenburg, 49.6, Hitler, 30.1.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.760]  And then it goes from there.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.640]  At the risk of belaboring the obvious,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.160]  almost 70% of German people voted against Hitler,
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.640]  causing his supporter, Joseph Goebbels,
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.520]  who later became Hitler's Minister of Propaganda
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.920]  to lament in his journal,
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.320]  we're beaten, terrible outlook,
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.400]  party circles badly depressed and dejected.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.920]  Since Hindenburg had not received a majority of the vote,
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.480]  however, a runoff election had to be held
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.920]  among the three top getters.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.760]  On April 19th, 1932, the runoff results
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.320]  were Hindenburg, 53, Hitler, 36,
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.200]  Thielemann, 10.2.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.160]  And then it just goes into how it was like parliamentary
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.720]  and they shared power and then they had the Reichstag fire
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.480]  and then Hitler got more power out of that.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.960]  That was basically right, yeah.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.720]  And it goes over all of it.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.960]  Hitler's rise to power and breaks it all down.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.320]  And how he turned the judiciary into a tyranny.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.560]  Okay, let's go back to your calls here.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.080]  Let's talk to Carol in Pennsylvania.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.000]  Thanks for holding.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.480]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.480]  Thank you, you too.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.920]  I wanted to tell you about one thing
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.360]  that just came up on my radar
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.880]  and ask you about another one.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.720]  Okay.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.640]  I went out last week and all of a sudden
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.000]  within a five mile radius,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.240]  we got three of these creepy billboards,
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.640]  don't lie for the other guy.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.960]  It's a program between the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.720]  and National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.400]  You get 10 years in jail if you help somebody get a gun
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.480]  who shouldn't get one.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.920]  Yeah, what they're doing is teaching people,
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.440]  they sell it like don't give a felon a gun
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.040]  or don't do a straw purchase,
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.320]  but now they're hyping it
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.000]  that if you give your grandson a gun
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.480]  or if you buy your wife a gun or you buy your dad a gun,
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.880]  I mean, my dad's given me guns, I've given him guns,
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.440]  that that's somehow illegal
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.160]  so the juries will send you to jail.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.360]  They call it a straw purchase.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.600]  It isn't really one,
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.400]  but I've seen them send people to prison
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.440]  for giving their grandson a gun.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.640]  So yes, I've seen the creepy title tell billboards
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.000]  going up everywhere.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.200]  Came up with all these laws that any crime with a gun,
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.040]  you get five years,
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.120]  but help somebody get that gun, you get 10.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.960]  But the other thing I wanted to ask you about
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.920]  is there's this thrive movie, thrive movement,
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.520]  and it's incredibly well-funded
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.040]  and it's run by Foster Gamble of the Proctor Gamble family.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.640]  The guest list in this movie reads like your guest list,
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.680]  but my spidey senses are telling me
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.880]  this is the controlled opposition kind of thing.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.720]  Sure, it's talking about a new economy and a new system.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.040]  The globalists want to offer solutions
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.120]  for what they've done, stay there.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.960]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.400]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.280]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:08.640]  to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.320]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.920]  The Cal-Bend Pure Soap Company
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.760]  can save you thousands of dollars
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.040]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.480]  that are triple concentrated
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:19.720]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.560]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.920]  that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.360]  or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.600]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.080]  that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.360]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.520]  If you want something better,
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.480]  if you want something you've never had before,
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.600]  you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.400]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.680]  and you actually get enough seeds
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.960]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:41.200]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.400]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com

[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.200]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.480]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.080]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.760]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.240]  of the New World Order,
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:32.640]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:37.080]  Okay, I almost got Rob Do, Aaron Dykes,
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.520]  and Rob Jacobson in here in studio
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.240]  because we get tons of emails about the Thrive movie
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.520]  and the Thrive movement.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.360]  And they've watched the film
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.120]  and basically gave me their synopsis,
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.960]  but I want to watch it before I pass judgment.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.040]  I know it has the air,
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.840]  the Procter & Gamble fortune in it,
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.600]  but people always have a chance to wake up
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.680]  and turn things around.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.800]  It has Catherine Austin Fitz and other,
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.520]  by the way, she's on the nightly news tonight,
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.840]  other good people, Bill Still,
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.680]  who's put out the Money Masters
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.720]  and also the Secret of Oz.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.440]  And so as we awaken people,
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.000]  there's gonna be good guys
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.760]  from the power structure that come out.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.480]  Rob and Aaron's breakdown is that
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.600]  it's basically Zeitgeist 2.0,
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.960]  that they admit the problems,
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.080]  they admit the world government.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:23.960]  Well, it's out in the open now,
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.320]  you can't not admit it.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.720]  But then it gets into UFOs, crop circles,
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.280]  which kind of discredits it,
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.760]  and then kind of gives some new agey solutions.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.560]  You see, they tried to deny all this was going on,
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.160]  but the problem with Zeitgeist
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.840]  is it sells a technocratic computer,
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.080]  who programs it,
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.840]  that decides who gets what resources.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.680]  And you live in these basically plastic cities.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.560]  I mean, I can't think of a more hellish system.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.640]  And if you've studied history,
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.720]  you know the communists back in the 20s and stuff
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.360]  always advertise their ideas
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.760]  with airships and spaceships and super science,
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.800]  and it's gonna be this wonderful new world.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.800]  And that's how they always advertise it.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.200]  I mean, even The Economist magazine
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.080]  when they're selling technocracy says,
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.400]  well, the communists sold it as a science fiction technocracy
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.640]  and it didn't go too well,
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.880]  but our technocracy is gonna do a really good job.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.720]  Cuz the central bankers wanna fix everything.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.000]  So what's happening
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.720]  is there's a huge awakening taking place.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.520]  And so I think it's a mix of both.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.640]  I have to see it before I can comment.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.520]  But three crew members have seen it,
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.960]  who are all smart people.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.400]  And they basically say the same thing.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.800]  I mean, I don't think people are bad for being in it.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.480]  But Carol, I have to not pass judgment at this point
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.320]  because I haven't seen it.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:43.240]  But briefly, give us your take on it.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.600]  Shoot, you got Gerald Cilente and David Icke.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.560]  I mean, it's a heck of a guest list.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.760]  But I think the solutions are soft core.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.480]  I think they're playing into the hands
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.480]  of global controlled organizations,
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.760]  Sierra Club and that kind of-
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760]  Oh, it's like, quote, fix the environment.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.040]  Everything's fixed.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.280]  Do they admit GMO is the real threat to the environment
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.200]  or is it carbon?
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.040]  No, it's a mix.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.480]  I mean, it's not just about the environmental stuff,
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.400]  but they're hooking you up
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.560]  with the Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.400]  They do talk about-
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.800]  Oh, that's all I needed to know
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.040]  because you know the Gamble family,
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:24.200]  they are the recipient of the Margaret Singer letters
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.280]  about getting rid of the black weeds.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.520]  You know, Aaron looked at me during the break
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.320]  and he said, all I know is they're hooked in
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:31.280]  with Margaret Singer and the eugenicist.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.840]  Now, I don't know about this guy individually,
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.800]  but if they're saying Sierra Club's gonna save us,
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.520]  that is all about the land grab,
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.880]  all about new world order.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.960]  Now, maybe the guy is a person waking up,
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.200]  but I don't know,
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.560]  apples usually don't fall too far from the trees
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.600]  and might be loyal opposition.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.920]  We'll have to look into it.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.280]  No, but that's a big, big, big, big sign right there.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.480]  See, I'm gonna be glad they're doing this though.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.720]  If they don't at least try to co-op things,
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.920]  they're gonna kill me
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.880]  because they know we are taking over,
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.360]  we are waking people up,
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.920]  we're the real deal, the real paradigm smashers.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.320]  And so at least they're not just, you know,
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.600]  starting a war with us now
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.480]  or trying to wipe out the leadership
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.040]  of the Patriot movement at this point,
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.120]  they're trying other things.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.360]  And so, you know, at least they're spinning their wheels
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.440]  because let me tell you, you're not turning this around.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.840]  Once somebody has a paradigm shift and gets into reality,
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.480]  it's not like there has to be some new installment
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.800]  of awakening.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.520]  People are on their own now waking up.
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.600]  It's like Ron Paul said on Fox News yesterday
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.680]  when they were attacking him.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.400]  He said, listen, my supporters don't desert.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:41.240]  My supporters don't just go away
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.720]  because once they put all this information together
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.160]  and see how the real world works, it's not Ron Paul.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.080]  I'm just a focal point of this.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.360]  It's a chain reaction.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.240]  You can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.800]  And that's right.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.000]  So, you know, good for Procter and Gamble dynasty.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.800]  Knock yourselves out.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.200]  Mix some space aliens in and try whatever you want
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.240]  because for every action is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.320]  Let's, thank you, Carol.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.080]  Let's go ahead and go to Blue,
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.360]  listening on 1470 AM Truth Radio in Tennessee.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.240]  You're on the air, Blue.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.360]  Hey, Alex, I pride myself on trying to find solutions.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.000]  I'm the one that called in and expressed the need
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.720]  for everyone to turn their cell phones on, speakerphone
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.440]  when they're pumping gas in the grocery stores
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.600]  to broadcast the message.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.280]  These are a few of the ideas that I've come up with.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.880]  One is to use Netflix.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:40.760]  I heard about two years ago, a gentleman that called in
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.960]  who had found you by watching the Obama deception
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.520]  on Netflix.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.240]  I think that lots of Google bombs that we've had.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:53.520]  We all pick a movie and we all type it
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.840]  into Netflix search engines at the same time
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  on the same day or as the equivalency of.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:03.840]  Then we can actually bring that through their algorithms
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.600]  and make it for, to bring it to the surface
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.000]  so that it's available to everyone.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  Two is to, the time to argue on talk radio
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.480]  about long talk is over.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.400]  Right now, we need to focus on the country music
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.560]  radio stations as well as the rock and roll stations
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.200]  and start pushing Patriot music and the reason why.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.040]  Every time they give you an opportunity to request a song,
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:35.520]  request Amy's song, which was Ron Paul's anthem from 2008
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.440]  and bring this to the surface because these people
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.440]  are only hitting the sound lights of the news.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.120]  And the third idea is that you've got to go
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  to your nightclubs and set up tables, register voters
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.200]  and be there to express Ron Paul's points of view.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.880]  Great points, appreciate the call.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:00.640]  Blue made a lot of really good points.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.640]  Look, if you want to really change things,
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360]  you've got to get involved in the streets.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.920]  You've got to get involved at your church.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.640]  You've got to get involved at work.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.360]  You've got to talk about liberty.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.800]  You've got to talk about real issues
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.640]  and point out what's happening everywhere.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.160]  And the best tool, bar none, are documentary films.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:28.000]  And that's why Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.200]  Endgame, Terror Storm, Fabled Enemies, Invisible Empire,
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.120]  all these films we've directed and produced,
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.960]  will explain how the globalists control both parties.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.440]  Will explain what their goals are,
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.400]  the different groups that work for them.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.400]  So that then when some group comes to you
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.640]  posing as a patriot, I mean,
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:54.800]  here's one of the most positive things that's happened,
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.440]  that I've seen anywhere in the last few years,
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.120]  is that whether it's Glenn Beck or Michael Savage
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.200]  or even Rush Limbaugh or these other talk show hosts,
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.880]  more and more, they're talking about the new world order.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.400]  They're talking about global government.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.800]  They're talking about the big mega banks.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.800]  They're talking about crony capitalism.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.960]  They're talking about real issues
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.520]  to keep their audience and to keep some credibility.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:23.760]  Now they'll double back and attack Ron Paul at key points,
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.600]  as we saw Savage do last week,
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.360]  because that's where their bread is buttered
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.080]  is by the establishment.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.040]  They're there to basically pose
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.920]  as alternative media that's controlled.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.760]  But the fact that we're making them
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.720]  cover so many real issues just to keep their audience
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:44.960]  shows the fact that our information is gaining ground
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.840]  every day.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.720]  And this attempt to make fun of Ron Paul
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.760]  because he talks about a new world order,
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.360]  I mean, that's what we're facing.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.600]  But the system wants to continue to operate
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.920]  like none of this is happening.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.360]  It's a global corporate government being set up
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.520]  by mega banks that have bought off our governments.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.080]  It's an illegitimate hijacking of our system.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:12.080]  I'm gonna go to John, Janice, Robert, Beth, Mike,
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.240]  and others here in just a little while,
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.160]  but I need to go ahead and get into the NDAA right now.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.920]  Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.560]  in Hawaii with no ceremony.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.240]  It was a private signing.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:30.840]  He released it obviously in the evening of New Year's
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:33.040]  so that it wouldn't get a lot of coverage.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.360]  And he signed it.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.680]  That's lie number one.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:37.240]  Because he said he wouldn't sign it.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.960]  He pledged, that was the term, pledge to veto.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:42.560]  We have links to that in our articles dealing with this.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.360]  So he pledged to veto it.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.160]  And we have that broken down in our latest article
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.560]  at infoawars.com.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.560]  Obama's NDAA signing statement is meaningless.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.360]  Administration itself demanded power
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.080]  to detain Americans without trial.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.640]  We have links to the Congress,
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.480]  the senators breaking it down.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.480]  We have the links admitting it's for US citizens.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.840]  I mean, Obama's already killing US citizens.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:07.600]  Killing US citizens without trials.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.320]  And we're all lucky and others were told
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.400]  to set the precedent.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.920]  And it goes over all of that.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.400]  So first they said it didn't affect US citizens.
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.320]  They lied about that.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.960]  Obama said it did affect citizens.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.000]  He would veto it.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.360]  Then he did sign it.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.320]  Then he lied again and said, I'm signing it,
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.520]  but don't worry, I'm not gonna implement it.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.480]  Because of our cherished values.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.880]  No, it's our laws.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.040]  That's another lie.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.680]  He's already implemented it.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:40.640]  They've already said in policy that they'll arrest US citizens.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640]  That they'll disappear into a black hole.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.160]  Because that was the quote policy of Bush.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.920]  When Bush got caught illegally wiretapping the American people.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.240]  He went to Congress and
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.280]  had him write a retroactive law saying it was legal.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.600]  Well, you can't pass laws that members of Congress can
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.360]  kill their wives.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:05.280]  You can't pass laws saying Hispanics will now be slaves.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.120]  Or people with English surnames will now be slaves.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.520]  Or Amish will be slaves or South Africans will be slaves.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.280]  You have an inherent right to not be a slave.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.920]  When somebody says it's the law, I can secretly arrest you.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.120]  They are tyrants.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.080]  They are frauds.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.760]  They have run up their flag.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.920]  You know who they are.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.160]  But I wanna address something else here.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.600]  Everybody is starting to really freak out.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.000]  And I'm asking it all over YouTube, all over the comments on Infowars,
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.760]  the emails, the calls, family calling, people apologizing on the street.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.520]  People buying me dinner at restaurants saying I thought you were a cook five
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.360]  years ago, it's all coming true.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.320]  And they're freaking out thinking the federal government
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:53.360]  is coming tomorrow because the ACLU has come out and Ron Paul has come out.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.480]  And now the media has had to admit, okay,
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.160]  it does end Posse Comitatus to put troops on the streets.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.320]  It does declare the whole world a war zone.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.040]  And it gives the President all this power.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.160]  This is really a war power to Obama.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.360]  I mean, there's so many facets to this, you can't even cover them all.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.680]  It says the President can launch attacks anywhere in the world
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.440]  without any congressional approval or even discussion.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.600]  So that's a huge violation of the war powers.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.840]  So worldwide declaration of war, end of war powers coming from Congress,
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.800]  huge seizure of power, declares the end of Posse Comitatus domestically,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.320]  the US a battlefield, says US citizens can be tortured, disappeared,
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.040]  never seen again, end of habeas corpus, end of bill of rights, end of Constitution.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.520]  And now finally, it's being admitted in a lot of mainstream news.
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:44.360]  So people are going, whoa, Alex, you were right.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.920]  I thought you were crazy.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:48.240]  My God, they're coming to get me tomorrow.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.160]  No, they're not coming to get you.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:55.240]  Why do you think, tomorrow, why do you think Obama lied about this and
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.720]  said he was going to veto it?
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:58.880]  And then they had surrogates in the media say, don't worry,
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.120]  it doesn't affect citizens.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:04.140]  They wanted to sneak that through to have it on paper so
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:08.040]  they could start brainwashing police and military to find out who will follow
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:08.520]  the order.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.120]  They want to quietly do this behind the scenes.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.840]  They don't want to have a big debate about what they're doing.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.280]  They're weak, and that's the key to all of this.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.680]  If you hear anything I say in my hours of covering news and information,
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:27.360]  it's this, they are doing this.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.920]  I mean, I went to bed at about 1130 midnight last night.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:32.400]  I woke up at 3 AM and wrote four pages of notes on this,
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.960]  just woke up with a brainstorm.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.000]  And I already knew all this, but it hit me.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.560]  I woke up at like 3 AM going, we're winning.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.320]  Sure, they lie to us out of hand.
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.680]  Sure, they like to train us to accept lies.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.280]  Sure, they use military parlance against their enemy, the American people,
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.960]  these foreign banks that run our military.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.480]  So they're going to lie to us out of hand.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:57.040]  To create a fog of confusion, to make things about the fog of confusion
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.440]  instead of ever debating, hey, can the military be on the streets?
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.520]  Can citizens be secretly arrested?
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.400]  And that's also done by the psycho idiot savants that run this,
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.280]  to make people that are awake feel helpless, to know the bill really does
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.840]  this, and then to not even be able to have a real debate about it.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.640]  So it's designed for
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.920]  people that don't really pay attention to just get confused and wander off.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.960]  And then they drive up in Tennessee, or Illinois, or Texas, Florida.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.480]  I mean, all over the country now, it's in the news, local news, never national.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.800]  because they're not ready for that yet.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.800]  You just pull up and there are the armies there, and
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.280]  they're searching everybody's cars.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.280]  This was going on in 1997 in Texas.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.640]  1998, we have video of army checkpoints.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.400]  And Mike Hansen's up there, driving back from Dallas.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.120]  He drives through Belton, there's an army checkpoint.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.200]  He pulls over, and the troops run over and say, turn your cameras off.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.920]  It's all in the takeover.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.040]  It happened to me in Belton at a military checkpoint.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:02.960]  And the army soldiers come over and say, I don't like you having your camera on.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.000]  And thought I was going to cower and wet myself.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.920]  And I got right back in his face and he said, you guys were at Belton, and
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.800]  showed my face on TV, I'm angry.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.040]  And I said, Buddy, you shouldn't be out here on the streets.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:21.840]  And it always started for ordinance control, quote, to defuse bombs.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:27.560]  But an FBI agent pulls up, gets out of the car, and says, here's why they're here.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.080]  Now get out of here.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.920]  And accidentally gave us a restricted document that's actually in the takeover
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.880]  that says, the military is operating in all 50 states covertly.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:41.640]  We're here for any reason, checkpoints, warrant service, kicking down doors.
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.480]  It says, warrant service, we're here.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:49.160]  A giant covert operation, 1998, in all 50 states.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:55.480]  This one's run out of Fort Hood in Texas.
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:58.560]  And it says, we're here 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.160]  This is a quote, 300 and plus days a year.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:04.280]  We're here 365 days a year.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.360]  We're here for you.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.600]  And you better believe I got freaked out by that.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.040]  Then I went to the urban warfare drills.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.080]  I said, I better look into this.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.160]  Who are they trying to fight?
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.280]  The American people.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.600]  So now this is all manifesting.
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.680]  So they want these powers to train behind the scenes and
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.560]  to get the cops and military ready to do this treason.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.800]  But they don't want a public debate.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.760]  They don't want opposition mounting to it.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.480]  They don't want people to realize how evil it is.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.880]  So Obama says, don't worry, I'm gonna veto it to kill opposition.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:38.520]  Don't worry, ceasefire, we're not gonna pass it.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.320]  So they could pass it.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.280]  People then say, don't worry, it passed, but he won't sign it.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.320]  He signs it.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.280]  Why did he sign it?
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.800]  We know from Carl Levin and others, because they ordered it to be in there.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.920]  Before it was gonna be the military and Congress and
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.240]  the government could secretly arrest.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.600]  And Obama said no, the executive,
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.000]  because they want that dictatorial power all to them.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.080]  Tyrants always fight over the power.
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:02.960]  So now it's in that one office.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.000]  So we now have this here as a wake up call.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.640]  But the next spin will see, they passed secret arrest of citizens, but
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.080]  nothing happened.
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:15.800]  Yeah, they're gonna wait till they stage terror attacks to blame it on
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:16.800]  domestic groups.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.000]  They're gonna wait till they launch a new big war.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.040]  They're gonna wait till things implode further.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:28.240]  To then have the test case where this guy that reportedly shot the ranger and
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.240]  shot people up in Washington State, I'm gonna cover him when we come back.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.640]  That could be a test case.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:39.040]  Oh, he shot a federal officer and he's bad and you know what?
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.400]  He doesn't deserve a proper trial, cuz he's a killer of a federal agent.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.840]  And that's what they did with the Patriot Act.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.920]  Remember Patriot Act?
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.640]  It's a handbook, a blueprint, a playbook.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.720]  Remember they said, hey, we're not gonna affect citizens.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.000]  We said, says right here, Section 802.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.720]  No, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.160]  Then they immediately started using it against citizens and non terror related.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:04.320]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.800]  reactors in Fukushima, Japan, and making its way across the entire US continent,
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.280]  contaminating the air, water, and food?
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.200]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:17.640]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.280]  anyone living in the US unless you do something to protect yourself.
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:21.800]  How?

[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:36.120]  Everybody knows the fight for the states, the poor state, the rich, and the poor.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.960]  Why do they lie on NDAA?
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.320]  What is the formula?
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.320]  Confuse the enemy.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.320]  That's us.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.040]  Our government has been taken over by foreign banks.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.760]  Get that through your head.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.680]  They are weak and they want to slip it in slowly.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:54.320]  They're waiting for a good test case to sell it to the public to roll it out.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.240]  They are waiting for the right crisis to bring this system out to the full public.
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:05.760]  They are already killing US citizens extrajudicially and saying they'll do it domestically.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.200]  They were already doing everything that's in the NDAA.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.360]  And again, why are we surprised by all Obama does is lie?
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:18.040]  He said he'd veto it, then he signs it.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.640]  Now he says, don't worry, I won't implement this though, it's up to me.
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:23.680]  He'll lie to you there.
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:26.400]  Because that's what they do.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.920]  That is their formula.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:29.680]  And I mentioned the Patriot Act.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.160]  You can just type in Patriot Act used in non-terror related cases.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:36.520]  We've done an analysis thousands of times per state per year.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.880]  They just violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:42.000]  They have Time Magazine, Newsweek, putting the Constitution down.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.340]  They actually tell people on the news, the central bankers will fix our problems.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.320]  And the Constitution is what caused them.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:56.280]  And then give no proof when it's the banksters that did this.
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:01.200]  Now I wanna get to this article out of the Seattle Times, massive manhunt after ranger
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.400]  slain outside Mount Rainier.
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:11.840]  And there's a photo of the soldier.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:15.840]  And he's got his evil assault weapons and my gosh, it is terrible.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:23.680]  It was a late night party and supposedly a bunch of people got shot at that event.
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:29.220]  And then the main suspect raced away in a car and he drove past a checkpoint.
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:35.740]  So another lone ranger parked in front of him blocking him on the road in the park.
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:39.320]  So he's the main suspect in shooting her.
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:43.800]  It said the SWAT team waited hours.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.400]  Even though they were there to go up and help her because they were afraid he might shoot
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.400]  them.
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:52.280]  I mean, what does you sign on for this for?
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:56.680]  I mean, nowadays, if we had a UT tower shooting, it'd be three days for the SWAT team went
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.080]  in, waiting for the feds to arrive and tell them what to do.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:03.320]  In the old days, people just charge in there and kill the guy.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:05.520]  Citizens started firing, keeping him pinned down.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:10.760]  Nowadays, in fact, it says here, I was reading this earlier in the day, just a massive amount
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:13.360]  of time that they sat there.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:19.680]  And then it is buried in the article, it's always buried, that he served two tours in
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:20.680]  Iraq.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:25.280]  I meant to actually highlight this article today and I tried to do it during the breaks.
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:30.960]  Yeah, he was shooting at him for 90 minutes while they were trying to help the lady.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.960]  That's my point.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.880]  They didn't go up there and take the guy out.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.840]  The old days, they would just gone up to where he was at.
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:44.600]  I mean, what was it, like three hours they waited in the Blacksburg, Virginia thing outside,
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.280]  waiting for the feds, an hour and a half to get there.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.400]  And then once the feds got there, they all dressed in their body armor and waited.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.360]  And by then it was all over.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.040]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that goes on.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:04.520]  But they break it down here in the article that the mother-in-law was worried about him
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:12.440]  and tried to get a restraining order and said he had PTSD from Iraq.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:17.400]  It says he was deployed in Iraq in 07, 08 and has possible PTSD issues.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:20.760]  But they won't even say what, whether he was a Marine or Army.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.800]  So it's got one line in there about it.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:27.400]  And this is another one of their machines breaking down.
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:31.160]  And the point is, it says 100 feds and more.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.760]  And they're talking about, well, we're not really hunting him right now because he's
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:35.760]  so dangerous.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:59:02.240]  And the point is, we'll break it down when we come back.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:16.840]  And
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:21.440]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:24.960]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:31.160]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:32.840]  digestive system.
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:40.080]  Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com

[01:59:50.520 --> 02:00:05.800]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:10.640]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.640]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:13.720]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:17.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:27.200]  All right, New Year's resolution is to take more calls, something I'm not good at.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.880]  Your calls are coming up in a moment, 800-259-9231.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:39.920]  My point is, you got one guy reportedly who shot some people at a party in a gun battle.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:42.480]  That's what the police believe.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:51.040]  He runs off into a national park, and the folks at the national park try to stop him.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:57.920]  He reportedly kills a park ranger, and then you read the article, it says the feds have
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:04.780]  got a drone looking for his infrared, and they haven't found him, and then he's so dangerous.
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:10.480]  They're still thinking of what they need to do before they go in.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.880]  This is one guy with some guns who's willing to use him.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:20.360]  All these people go, they've got drones and helicopters.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:22.400]  No one can defeat the federal government.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:25.200]  If there's a civil war, they're gonna come and they're gonna get us.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:29.960]  No, what they're gonna do is shut down the cities and let people start starving.
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:33.200]  That's all they can do is barricade cities.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:40.000]  You try to send people out door to door to take guns, and it's over.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.600]  The American people know what's going on.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.040]  They're arming to the teeth.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:46.800]  Most of the military are great men and women, and they know what's going on.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.120]  They're donating to Ron Paul in record numbers.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:54.100]  But what do you do when you get pulled over by some crazy cop, it happens all the time
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:02:00.600]  to people, who's been in Iraq and Afghanistan for five tours, and you argue with them about
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:06.000]  the fact that you weren't speeding, so they taser you and break your jaw or kill you.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.320]  You've seen these videos of these high and tight.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:14.680]  They're always former vets, totally crazed, and they pull somebody over and don't like
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:19.600]  what you say, and they go crazy on you.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:24.440]  That's the old thing after World War II in Korea and Vietnam, in every community, it
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.600]  was like, leave that guy alone, he's an old vet.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.920]  Leave old Bobby alone, he'll go crazy on you.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:35.280]  Because they don't care, they'll just start killing people.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.520]  You don't just kill a bunch of people and do all this stuff, and then it stops.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:45.280]  You get addicted to it, not that you even like it on average, but that it's what you
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.160]  know how to do.
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:53.600]  That's why you don't wanna military domestically, cuz the military kills people and breaks things.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:03:03.320]  A peace officer defuses, helps communities, and then uses force if they have to.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:09.000]  Because when you use force on somebody, ladies and gentlemen, it comes back on you.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.440]  When you use force on somebody, even in the right, it leaves scars on you.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.440]  But if you do things, except for the most evil people, and that's a very small percentage,
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:20.400]  most of our troops that are even doing bad stuff are not bad people.
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:24.600]  Most of the police who are doing bad things aren't evil people on average.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.800]  They're delusional, they're stressed out, they're crazy.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:35.760]  And the last group they need to be hiring as police are combat troops that have served
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.320]  more than two tours.
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.680]  It might be good to have cop who's been in the military serve a tour, if they aren't
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:45.340]  crazier than a bloody March Hare.
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:49.680]  But they want the, quote, tough guys that'll crack the heads of the American people.
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:54.160]  They try to soup them up, they try to get them in a combat stance towards the American
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:55.160]  people.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.160]  And I'm gonna tell you right now, we're gonna break them back to your calls, I'm gonna tell
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.720]  you right now what's gonna happen.
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:07.400]  As more park rangers get killed, as more cops get killed, as the police get more and more
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:12.600]  paranoid about the public, and see us as the enemy, and see veterans as the enemy, there's
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:13.600]  the paradox.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.240]  The police are full of veterans, but they're also taught the veterans are the number one
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.240]  threat.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:22.520]  And by the way, it's true, cuz they're trained killing machines who are committing suicide
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.120]  in mass at record numbers.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:31.040]  And then as you push them, they're gonna blow gaskets and start killing you.
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:38.000]  And then the police act even crazier towards the public, and then it's off to the races.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.400]  De-escalation is the key word here.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.980]  Because if we have a civil war here, ladies and gentlemen, it's only gonna help the globalist.
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:51.480]  We need to reach out to police and military now and educate them about these facts.
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:54.920]  And it's the truth, they'll totally click.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:58.480]  It's easy to wake up a cop or the military, it's the easiest groups to wake up, you just
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.480]  gotta do it.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.480]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:02.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.120]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:10.040]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.440]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.240]  on earth.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:23.040]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.880]  expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:29.580]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful

[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:48.760]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:50.800]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.800]  It's here.

[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.040]  a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:18.320]  Okay, finishing up with the NDAA and how it ties into Americans by Record Number of Guns
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:25.080]  for Christmas and how that ties in to this report out of the Seattle Times.
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:30.440]  Massive manhunt after Rangers slain at Mount Rainier.
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:36.120]  Late night gun battle at a late night party.
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:40.280]  The suspects trying to hide out in the woods.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.060]  The Rangers set up a roadblock.
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:47.120]  He goes around them, comes to a second roadblock, gets out, shoots the Ranger from concealment,
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.520]  starts shooting at the SWAT teams and police that arrive.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.220]  He has been found dead.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:57.300]  They don't know if he committed suicide or if he died from wounds in the shootout.
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:58.800]  But this just came out.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.280]  Pierce County officials say the Iraq war vet, notice they won't say Marines or Army, being
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:08.720]  sought in the killing of a Mount Rainier National Park Ranger has been found dead in a ditch
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:10.760]  near his car at the crime scene.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:14.720]  Yeah, they probably killed him in the gun battle, but they waited just forever to even
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:16.600]  go up around it.
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.320]  Continuing, some 200 SWAT officers, police and Rangers, and Mount Rainier National Park
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.560]  in Washington State were searching Monday for an Iraq war veteran suspect in the killing
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.960]  on Sunday of a Ranger.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.900]  So it took him over a day.
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:37.060]  Highlights from news coverage, so it's all broken down there.
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:43.740]  So he was dead in a ditch for more than a day right there and they wouldn't even go
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:44.740]  up by the car.
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:48.520]  And that just confirms what I was saying earlier.
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:54.400]  Hundreds and hundreds, it said over 100 fads with hundreds of other local police, all just
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:57.800]  saying we're not even gonna try to go down the road, he might get us.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:03.120]  Bring in the drones, and again, I'm just saying it's a change in policing.
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:07.280]  Because in the old days, people didn't have to talk about how macho they were all day.
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.440]  In the old days, police were trained just to charge in.
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:12.280]  If you got shot, that's what you signed up for.
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.520]  Yeah, the tower shooting is a great example.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.800]  We've actually had that Texas Ranger in here, he was an Austin cop at the time.
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:21.640]  And the locals all just got out their guns and kept the guy pinned down, or he would
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.360]  have killed many more.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.860]  And the police just went right up the tower and right up there to kill the guy.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:30.920]  And by the way, he started shooting at him and they just went in with, took him out with
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:33.920]  shotguns.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:38.540]  But I mean, Blacksburg, it was over three hours they sat there while he was in there
[02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:40.040]  killing people.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.840]  And then they say, don't have guns.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:46.560]  And then they said they locked the park down and wouldn't let people get out while he was
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:48.000]  doing it miles away.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.920]  I mean, look, I'm in a national park.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:54.720]  And they say, we're locking you in the basement for a day because somebody's got a gun.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:58.880]  I'm like, no, I'm not gonna sit here and wait in a basement for somebody somewhere in a
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.000]  park to come kill me.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.160]  The answer is guns to protect yourself from people like this.
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:09.120]  Now, to be clear, the average military man and woman is incredibly dedicated.
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.080]  All the statistics are they're hardworking, good people.
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:19.280]  But if you put them in more than two or three tours, statistically people start to get really
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.400]  screwed up.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.820]  That's just PTSD, it's a real deal.
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:28.880]  My issue is this is a problem reaction solution paradigm.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:33.600]  The social engineers know full well when they have people serve two, three, four, five,
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:35.800]  six, seven, eight, nine tours.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:45.760]  I was on that aircraft with that Air Force MP captain, he was going to bury his buddy
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.760]  at Fort Hood.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.320]  They had the cast come on board the Southwest Airlines craft.
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:53.000]  I talked to him for three hours flying back from that video shoot in Las Vegas with Jesse
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  Ventura.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:04.640]  And he talked about how he was going into his ninth tour since 9-11, ninth tour, and
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.360]  how his buddy had been in nine.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:11.920]  And finally got blown up by a roadside bomb, what was it, in Afghanistan.
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:15.560]  And he'd been in Iraq, hadn't been with his buddy in over a year.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.720]  And again, the awesome police know about this cuz they were all there to pick up the casket
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.120]  and take it to Fort Hood with a big parade or whatever.
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:27.200]  If you really cared about the troops, you wouldn't have them served tour after tour.
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.960]  And I said, well, what's it like being an Air Force MP?
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:32.520]  He goes, in these countries, we're the ones that have to drive the convoys through.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.920]  We're the ones that have to guard the bases.
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:35.680]  We're the ones that actually get attacked all the time.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.840]  And he said, now, in all branches of the armed service, you're facing combat.
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:42.840]  And it's not like there's the enemy, we're gonna go have a big war with them.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:46.220]  It's the worst type where it's just extreme boredom, and then somebody starts shooting
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.320]  at you or throws a hand grenade.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.560]  This is what's going on.
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.640]  So the system knows you're gonna get a percentage of these vets that come back who are gonna
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.480]  engage in all this violence.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.800]  And they're gonna use those guys to demonize all the veterans and go after all the veterans
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:06.360]  generally and try to restrict them from having the Second Amendment.
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:07.440]  And that's already happening.
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:11.280]  It's happened to people with no criminal record, no problem.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:13.300]  They're going in to buy a gun, they can't.
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:19.160]  But the other group of PTSD people, they're being taken and made, actually, in many cases,
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:23.060]  the really bad apples, they're being made police.
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:28.360]  And so they're the people that pull people over and you see the person barely even ask
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:29.360]  a question.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.880]  And the cop drags them out and starts beating them or shoots them or tasers them because
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:37.280]  they're crazy.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:41.160]  And they have an appetite now for violence just to feel normal.
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.200]  Because if you've been involved in violence over and over and over and over and over again,
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:49.120]  you expect for it to happen some more just so you feel normal.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:54.160]  In fact, guys, you can pull it up, just type in record number of suicides.
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:14:00.960]  The last time I saw the number two weeks ago, it was seven times any previous number.
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:05.500]  Seven times, and so the system knows they're all coming home.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:09.600]  And so they're gonna have one group of veterans and the police attacking another group of
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:12.680]  veterans who are, quote, civilians.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:17.600]  And it is just a nightmare scenario, but the big nugget here, the big point I wanna make
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:20.280]  here today is this.
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:26.600]  Under NDAA, they've already had it going on for six, seven years, regular army at checkpoints,
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:33.680]  army helping cut people out of cars, army doing all this PR stuff so the rollout can
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:35.080]  be sold to the public.
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:40.560]  But in the real manuals that are now been released to everybody, it's all about veterans,
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.880]  gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, Ron Paul supporters.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:48.480]  It's the veterans that have got their act together.
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.440]  It's the veterans that know who the enemy is, you are the enemy.
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:57.120]  And you are gonna be blamed and demonized for these other people, the people that are
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:02.500]  throwing the puppies off the cliffs, the people that are blowing up the Iraqi families.
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:04.800]  How do I know this?
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.640]  From constant research, constant research.
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:14.600]  I remember how they hired people for Abu Ghraib, it came out in the army investigation.
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:21.680]  The federal government went around in 2002 in the build up to the war and then in 2003
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:26.600]  right before it started in March, and would hire former federal and state guards who had
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.440]  been caught abusing people and raping people.
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:31.960]  And they said, you want another job?
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:34.840]  How about triple the pay?
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:40.520]  So see, the government is looking for the bad guys that'll bomb in Oklahoma City, that'll
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.800]  rape a child, that'll do this kind of stuff.
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.160]  And they're trying to get rid of all the good people that are in government, just like Stalin
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:50.240]  and Hitler opened up the prisons and put criminals in charge.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.720]  This is what they're doing, but I got a message to all those people.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:59.800]  What do you think is gonna happen, and it's already starting, when the system tries to
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:02.720]  crack down on lawful gun owners and veterans?
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:09.440]  It is an unwinnable scenario for the globalist if you think that they care about the troops
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:11.680]  and police, they don't though.
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:16.960]  They want this country to descend into a banana republic, they've planned the whole deal.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:21.600]  They want the civil insurrection, they think they know how to deal with it.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:26.200]  And this is one of the false flag events they want is a civil war in this country, and we've
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.960]  got to avoid it.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:32.760]  They know full well when they send people off to five, six, seven, eight, nine tours,
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.760]  you're gonna get a lot of unstable people coming back.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:38.840]  All right, let's go to the calls, who's been holding the longest, Janice and then John.
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.840]  Janice in Texas, thanks for holding, welcome.
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:43.840]  Hi, Alex, happy new year.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:44.840]  Happy new year to you.
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:51.640]  My new year's resolution was to give up C-SPAN, and I was editing through all these meetings
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:57.480]  that I hadn't watched before, and I came across something so absolutely horrifying, it left
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:58.480]  me trembling.
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:06.240]  The title of the meeting is the Joint Chiefs of Staff Expansion Proposal, and it was about
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.800]  giving the National Guard a chair at the Joint Chiefs and what the National Guard could do
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:14.560]  domestically under Title 10 and Title 32.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.640]  And then they're all fighting, and Lindsey Graham, it's Lindsey Graham's turn, and he
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:25.560]  is so completely high and crazed out of his mind, his eyes are like glass, and he keeps
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:31.260]  licking his lips and his shoulders are jerking back and forth, and he's like yelling at the
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:34.520]  Joint Chiefs and telling them it's not up to them, it's up to him.
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:36.360]  Anyway, it's just something-
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:38.580]  Well, I'll tell you what, what was the date of this?
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:43.720]  Because they are under NORTHCOM, rolling National Guard, not giving them a seat, but actually
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.480]  taking them away from the governors and the legislatures, and that's in the John Warren
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:49.240]  Defense Authorization Act 07.
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:52.880]  They admit it's for civil unrest by the legislatures.
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:57.920]  They're saying legislatures, if you try to exercise your 9th or 10th Amendment, we're
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.120]  gonna occupy you.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:03.360]  That's why they now have the puppet 10-member governor and the rural council.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.440]  But I've seen Graham, and if he's not on amphetamines or cocaine or something, I'm an Easter Bunny.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:14.120]  If we're gonna play the clip again tonight where he talks about how he wants people scared
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:17.880]  and you bet it's for citizens and the NDAA.
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:23.040]  And looking at his face, he looks like he's not drunk, cuz I've seen one where Lieberman
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.560]  looks like he's drunk.
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:28.060]  But Graham looks like he's hopped up on something.
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:31.640]  It may just be power though, Janice.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.880]  I'm not sure, I've been on the road with rock and roll bands my whole life, and I've seen
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.560]  High on hopped up, I mean, and he is hopped to the nines.
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:44.640]  It's like criminal insanity got together with cocaine and had a baby and named it Lindsey
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:45.640]  Graham.
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:47.800]  I mean- Well, no, I mean, I've looked at his eyes
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:53.920]  on TV and up there, he is crazy, sweating and jerking around and, you bet it's for American
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:54.920]  citizens.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:55.920]  I wanna be scared.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:59.000]  I mean, I even talked about that last week.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.840]  So what else happened in this meeting?
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:06.560]  Well, what you were just saying, there was way too much for me to take it all in.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.160]  That's why I wanted you to have a look at it, because they talk about NORTHCOM, the
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:16.600]  Joint Chiefs do not want the National Guard to have a chair there, and they say NORTHCOM
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:25.040]  is part of it that takes care of it, and Lindsey Graham is saying, no, no, no, and basically,
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:31.000]  it all, this all happened like two weeks before they passed the NDAA, and I wouldn't have-
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.880]  Yeah, when you watch Lieberman and all of them, they are shaking with power trips.
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:43.120]  Whenever they pass the NDAA in the Senate, Jay Rockefeller was just super excited.
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:46.240]  It was like, I mean, they know what they're doing.
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.320]  I've seen famous newsreels of Hitler when he was taking over Czechoslovakia and stuff,
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:55.560]  they're walking around rubbing their hands together, and give me the date of that so
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:58.600]  I can pull that up on the C-SPAN archives when we come back.
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:01.160]  Any other points you want to add, then I'm going to go to John and others.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:04.120]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:07.060]  This time warns of Greek-style US debt crises.
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:08.060]  You heard me right.
[02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:12.600]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the US economy, its debt, and the current Greek
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.240]  economic meltdown.
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:19.280]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:21.240]  rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:22.820]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:28.560]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:30.040]  for every American.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:35.200]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:37.860]  interest rates spell economic disaster.
[02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:41.920]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:47.600]  Call me today at 800-686-2237, and I'll send you a free copy.
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:54.000]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.520]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:58.520]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:07.200]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:08.200]  back on?
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:12.240]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:16.000]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  Here's why.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:21.520]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:23.160]  of our oldest sponsors.
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:27.960]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:33.320]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:34.360]  from the sun.
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:38.200]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:42.480]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.760]  power outages again.
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:48.320]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:49.720]  Solutions from Science.
[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:52.800]  Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:56.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:05.440]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:06.760]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:12.300]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:15.280]  who love darkness, bondage and enslavement.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:20.240]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart.
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:23.960]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:29.360]  Recently New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:33.180]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:34.920]  The globalists are scared.
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:35.920]  They've overreached.
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:39.640]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.120]  globalist propaganda platform.
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:57.400]  We are going to use their system against them.
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.320]  The info war now goes into high gear.
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:05.460]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:11.160]  I designed our top selling holster, the Supertuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked,
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:13.780]  pinched and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:19.120]  The Supertuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.

[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:58.920]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:13.640]  Yeah, I haven't really gotten into the economic news or the latest on Iran or what's happening
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:14.640]  with the polls.
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.760]  Ron Paul's still in number one.
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:20.040]  Politico got caught claiming that Paul was in number three when he was number one in
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:21.040]  the poll.
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:22.960]  They're gonna try all sorts of dirty tricks.
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:27.840]  The Republicans are gonna count the votes in secret, the Republican establishment.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:30.920]  And they are really, really scared.
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:34.640]  But yes, years ago when I had more time, I was addicted to C-SPAN.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:40.240]  I mean, that's how I knew TSA was gonna be on the streets nine years ago.
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:42.760]  That's how I knew they were gonna start making people go through the government to be able
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:48.960]  to have a job, quote, homeland security because I watched a two hour meeting with the whole
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:51.840]  thing being planned out.
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:59.400]  And I mean, that's what's frustrating is that the media will debate say five degrees of
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:02.680]  a 360 degree system.
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.720]  They'll act like they're debating with the Republican and the Democrat on the show, whether
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:08.440]  it should be done like this or that.
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:13.120]  But they're only debating one little bitty area that basically does the same thing regardless
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.160]  of what decision is made.
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:20.160]  And they create these fake consensuses where they have the consensus with all the talking
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.080]  heads debating, well, when do we strike Iran?
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:28.480]  And then they have debates about it, but never, why are we striking Iran?
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:32.360]  Or why are we being lied to again?
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:40.400]  And the controlled corporate media, the dinosaur media, has total disdain for the public, total
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:43.200]  disdain.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:46.760]  Janice finishing up, what was the name of the hearing again?
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:51.120]  And when was it, cuz now you can search everything in the last few months, they've upgraded the
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.720]  C-SPAN website, where you can search it with the name and date and find anything right
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:59.040]  there on the site, the video, everything.
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:05.200]  Yeah, if you just go to cspan.org and type in Joint Chiefs of Staff expansion proposal,
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.200]  that'll bring it up.
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:11.200]  But I think this video needs to go viral of Lindsey Graham because he's also, when he's
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:20.920]  doing his jerking like craziness, he talks about national emergencies, disasters, hurricanes,
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:28.080]  whatever, using the guard on the citizens as a battlefield, I mean, it's just, it's
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:29.080]  insane.
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.080]  I was so scared.
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:34.160]  I'm sorry, I'm just so worked up, I can't even believe I found it.
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:37.400]  Well, listen, it's like a caller called us a few weeks ago and said, you haven't seen
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.920]  the debates where they admit there's a secret torture provision?
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:44.920]  And I'm like, well, I know there's bestiality in the NDAA, I know it's the end of posse
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:50.520]  comitatus, a global declaration of war, but no, I didn't know they actually admit torture.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.680]  And then we went and found the clips they mentioned and sure enough, it's four senators
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:57.880]  going, we're gonna torture Americans and we want you to be afraid.
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:02.800]  I mean, that's the definition of terrorism and they were all getting real wild eyed.
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:06.860]  Lieberman looks drunk and is licking his lips getting off on it.
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:11.640]  They're like cartoon bad guys and Graham is hopping around on the stage.
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:16.520]  McCain is hopping around.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:19.360]  Levin's all hunched over like a snake.
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:25.200]  Man, this is super creepy, I appreciate your call, Janice, I mean, you watch these guys,
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:30.420]  you know, it's not for, quote, al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda works for them, it's for the American people.
[02:27:30.420 --> 02:27:33.080]  John in New York, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:36.920]  Good afternoon, do you hear me?
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:40.480]  Thank you for giving me the privilege of speaking to you today, I'm a first time caller and
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.800]  a fairly new listener.
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:48.240]  Now my commenting question is, before I discovered your show and the 9-11 Truth Movement, Patrick
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:54.120]  Buchanan was my favorite political commentator, afterwards you became number one and he became
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:58.820]  number two or three, so my question to you is, did he ever try to contact him and ask
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:02.760]  him about the 9-11 Truth, because he knows about the New World Order, he's written
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:07.480]  books about it, he endorsed Ron Paul in his magazine and he reads to Bill Edgman in November
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:09.920]  2009, that's it.
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:19.480]  Well, God bless you, I appreciate your call, John, look, I've met Pat Buchanan a few times,
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:26.440]  I worked for his campaign at the lowest level, had out yard signs and stuff many, many years
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:31.640]  ago, I guess, in 92 and then 96.
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:38.880]  So I like Buchanan on a lot of issues, but Buchanan won't commit political suicide and
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.800]  Ron Paul won't do it either, they've got that clip of Ron Paul being asked by the lovely
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:49.920]  lady, why won't you cover 9-11 Truth and he said, well, I'm busy with other things.
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:57.120]  And now they're saying, hey, this staffer says that you said it was the government,
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:02.400]  I tend to think that's probably not true, plus the guy ran against him in his congressional
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:09.080]  seat, it's probably a mole, I don't know that, but it doesn't matter.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.880]  Ron Paul only goes with what he can prove one way or the other, and that's why he hasn't
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:18.400]  gotten into 9-11 Truth, but he does talk about false flag terror, he came on my show a few
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:22.840]  weeks ago and it's been all over the news, New York Times, you name it, and said, hey,
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:28.680]  the government staged this deal with the Iranians to blame them for a plot to kill the Saudi
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:29.680]  ambassador.
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:33.600]  And the New York Times and others came out and said Ron Paul was insane, well, we wrote
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:39.760]  an article showing the New York Times saying what Ron Paul had said, it was all the experts
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:46.000]  on even mainline wouldn't go along with this, it was totally fake, so I mean Ron Paul gets
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.600]  attacked from talking about stuff that's admitted.
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:57.560]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:04.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator,
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:09.320]  number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill,
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:14.240]  number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:19.840]  you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:24.320]  is coming, number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:29.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem, number four,
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:34.340]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids, every year thousands of families lose
[02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:39.120]  their power from weather related onages, number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:43.280]  backup insurance and peace of mind, folks I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:47.600]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:54.480]  at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government doesn't own the sun,

[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:12.320]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:22.760]  You see, if I have researched something and I know it's the truth, I don't care how destructive
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:29.480]  it is, I don't care how much I get attacked, how much I get demonized, I've got to tell
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.720]  the truth.
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:39.000]  Lying for me is incredibly hard to do, I mean, sometimes my wife's wearing something that
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.440]  I don't particularly like and she'll ask me, do you like this?
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:47.280]  And I'll tell her, no, I don't like it, and of course, you learn real early on with girlfriends
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:50.880]  that you get married that they ask what you think, but they usually don't really want
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:53.680]  to know, so it's like, do you like this?
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:58.220]  And of course, if they like it and you tell them no, they'll get irritated, but you know
[02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:02.700]  what, if somebody makes me food and they say, did you like it and I don't, I'm like, I like
[02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:06.760]  that other dish you make better.
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.240]  My mom asked me on Christmas, she says, do you like that kind of cabbage?
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:14.280]  She makes this purple cabbage, it's really good, I don't know how to describe it, it's
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.780]  really tasty.
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:19.080]  And I was like, yeah, this is even better than you usually make it, sometimes it's a
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:24.520]  little, you overcook it, it's a little slimy, she kind of gives me this look.
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:28.800]  I'm like, well, no, this is, she's a great cook, I'm like, no, no, no, it was always
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:33.280]  my favorite before, now I like the way you did this one even better.
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:39.240]  The thing is, is that I've gotten to the point where I just cannot pull punches with people.
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:43.500]  I mean, that's why I'm honest on here about myself too, people say, why did you say that
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:45.320]  about yourself?
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:54.940]  Because I've found it helps my thinking process if I'm just truthful.
[02:34:54.940 --> 02:35:06.280]  Because when you lie to somebody, it's almost like you lie to yourself, and so I think the
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:13.920]  beginning of turning around our society is that we all start being more honest.
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:17.740]  And I think we should be honest about lies we've told even when we don't know we've told
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:18.740]  them at the time.
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:24.640]  I mean, I'll hear rebroadcast sometimes or I'll see videos I've done where there's a
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:28.840]  fact in it that is completely wrong, it's not very often.
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:33.760]  And I think back, like I saw a video the other day from two years ago that somebody brought
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.520]  to my attention and what I said was not true.
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:45.360]  And I've spent probably 15 hours the last few weeks in my mind trying to figure out,
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:49.480]  why did I say that?
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:54.840]  Because I can't remember why I said it and it's like a brittle or a conundrum.
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:57.440]  It's like, why did I say that?
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:10.400]  Cuz I'm not being sarcastic and it's not true.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.840]  But I guess for people that don't have a conscience, they just think that's fun to lie all day
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.840]  long.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:23.600]  Well, a lot of philosophers said know thyself, you need to know yourself first then you'll
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:25.600]  know others.
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:37.320]  So I've said it, I mean, I am an obnoxious, slovenly person, but that's only one aspect
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:41.920]  of who I am.
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:45.140]  And I've got to strive to be a better person.
[02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:49.560]  Because if you don't strive to be a better person, well, then who are you?
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:57.280]  You just give in to being corrupt, you just give in to being stupid, you just give in
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:58.280]  and have no standard.
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:02.920]  I mean, if we don't have a Bill of Rights and Constitution, the sky or I should say
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.920]  the bottomless pit is the limit.
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:10.400]  And of course, something that's bottomless doesn't have a limit.
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:18.160]  The scope of depravity, I mean, I have this total instinct driving to wanna protect little
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:19.880]  old ladies and children.
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.440]  A lot of people call that goody two shoes or a softy or pathetic.
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:28.920]  No, I'm not a softy, I have an instinct to wanna have a good society.
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:37.200]  I have an instinct to wanna help people because I'm normal.
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.820]  And in this crazy world, I'm abnormal.
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:45.240]  In this crazy world, Ron Paul is abnormal, because he's a constitutionalist for common
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:46.240]  sense.
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:51.160]  What did George Orwell say in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:52.160]  act?
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:54.980]  Let's go through five or six more calls and I'll hit the final news here in the first
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:56.560]  show of the new year.
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:38:00.800]  I think it's been pretty powerful so far, we've gotten a lot of key information out.
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:10.240]  Folks, I don't want you to be scared of this NDAA.
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:16.840]  I want you to, from my perspective, use it to wake people up and say, okay, here's the
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:19.320]  end of Posse Comitatus, we told you that was coming.
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:21.520]  They say they can arrest you and disappear into a black hole.
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:24.440]  And if they say, I heard on the news that wasn't true.
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:28.000]  Here, really, let me take you over to info.wars.com.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.780]  And we've got articles here with all these links to videos where the senator's saying
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:37.280]  it, that it is for citizens, and saying they'll kill you if they want to or torture you.
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:40.400]  And saying that Obama wanted it added.
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:47.120]  Because I've never seen something wake people up like this NDAA.
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.040]  And so when Obama comes out and says, okay, it does affect citizens, I'm gonna sign it.
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:59.560]  Cuz I don't wanna hold up the military appropriations and pay for the troops.
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:03.640]  And then it turns out, it's on record, the White House lawyers and Obama told Congress,
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:05.320]  you do this or we're gonna veto it.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:11.440]  I mean, that is a level of deception that is really waking people up.
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:16.720]  But again, why did they hide it?
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:18.800]  Why did they hide it?
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:24.480]  Why did they first try to claim it wasn't in there so they could pass it?
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:28.600]  And then now that it's passed, they're trying to say it isn't in there.
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:37.320]  Because the enemy showing itself, the foreign megabanks trying to engage in a coup d'etat,
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:38.320]  that's what this is.
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:41.000]  The caller from Germany last hour was spot on.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:46.960]  Hitler was elected in a power sharing agreement with Kaiser Wilhelm and himself.
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:52.240]  They had a parliament, and he was the second biggest party.
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:56.180]  And then Hitler used stage terror attacks to get power.
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:02.280]  And right on time, Kaiser Wilhelm had a stroke, and he just signed the power over to Hitler.
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:08.480]  Because of the threat of the communist, it was like go with the fascist or the communist
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:09.600]  will take over.
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:15.160]  And the old line elite threatened by revolution, being funded by the big same megabanks that
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:17.120]  were funding the fascist.
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:21.120]  See, they win either way, just like Carol Quigley wrote at Georgetown.
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.000]  The system wins either way.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.680]  When they fund tyranny, different variants of it.
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:28.980]  Let me read you a few quotes here.
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:36.880]  This is Bertrand Russell from his book, The Impact of Science on Society, 1952.
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:43.040]  Nobel Prize winner, one of the top theoreticians and philosophers of the eugenics New World
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:44.040]  Order.
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:48.320]  If a black death could spread throughout the world once in every generation, survivors
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:53.240]  could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:41:00.000]  There would be nothing in this to offend the conscious or the devout or to restrain the
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.240]  ambition of nationalists.
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.760]  The state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what if really high minded people are
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.120]  indifferent to happiness, especially other peoples?
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:15.840]  So he's saying, what if we need to be high minded and release bioweapons?
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:17.880]  Bertrand Russell, here's another quote.
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.560]  Diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:27.720]  of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:31.960]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will be psychologically impossible.
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:40.940]  Even if all the miserable, all will believe themselves happy, because the government will
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:43.120]  tell them that they are so.
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:51.000]  War has here to been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps biological war may be
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  proven effective.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.200]  Because before that in the past, he's talking about reducing population.
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:00.440]  Bertrand Russell wanted to, and of course, H.G. Wells originally wrote this about 30
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:06.560]  years before they invented A-bombs, where atomic bombs are dropped on all the cities
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:10.840]  to reduce population.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:15.400]  The original book was called The Shapes of Things to Come, and the movie that came out
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:19.720]  in the 30s was called Things to Come, H.G. Wells, watch it.
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:25.240]  They have B-2 bomber batwing aircraft flying around nuking all the cities to get rid of
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:26.240]  the people.
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:32.920]  Hey guys, will you Google H.G. Wells, The Shape of Things to Come, when that was published?
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:34.920]  I forget.
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:39.160]  I know the movie was in the early 30s.
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:41.200]  We've got clips of it in Endgame.
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:44.960]  I mean, look, they thought this stuff up, and look, they run the world.
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:49.100]  Listen, this was a commenter I saw in a Russia Today interview I did, where I was covering
[02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:53.560]  how the government admits they're spying on everybody without warrants.
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:58.960]  And these, because I went to this guy's site, he was like a little neocon.
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:03.040]  He thinks war and death, I guess, is cool.
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:06.040]  He says, it makes sense that the US government spies.
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:11.200]  But then, if I was running the world for the best of its actions, I would spy too.
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:13.320]  Heck, God is always watching.
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:15.680]  I mean, personally, it just makes sense.
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:20.600]  If you want to know what's up with people and making sure or trying to cut down on crime,
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:24.840]  duh, you spy or check in on the peeps once in a while.
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:30.160]  It's not like you'd like them coming to your door with a survey every three months, because
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:35.280]  it's not like people should have anything to hide, right?
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:38.880]  The criminals that run the society want to enslave you.
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:40.720]  It's not that you have something to hide.
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:51.040]  Every time we get governments that start spying on everybody, horrible oppression always follows.
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:54.840]  The Shape of Things to Come, a work of science fiction by H.G. Wells, published in 33.
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:01.840]  Okay, so I guess the movie in that came out right after it, which speculates on future
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:06.060]  events from 1933 until the year 2106.
[02:44:06.060 --> 02:44:15.640]  The book is dominated by Wells' belief in a world state as a solution to mankind's problems.
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:17.360]  But I thought there's no world state.
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:19.240]  I mean, Ron Paul's crazy.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.800]  I played the Huntsman interview earlier.
[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:26.240]  The Huntsman ad that has clips from my film Endgame, where Ron Paul says George Bush Sr.
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:29.920]  called for a new world order, and they're playing Twilight Zone music.
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:32.680]  I mean, that's all they call for in any of this stuff.
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:36.800]  And they're setting it up, the headlines, Goldman Sachs conquers Europe.
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.760]  Now the world, world government to be run by private banks.
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:44.400]  I don't want to live under a world government run by private banks.
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:46.040]  I'd like to have my own country.
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:48.360]  Shut up, crazy man, it doesn't exist.
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:52.800]  This is the level of hoax we're dealing with.
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:56.320]  And the good news is they're losing more and more of their power to hoax people.
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:01.280]  From the bottom of my heart, I want to speak to the enforcers, the bureaucrats, the people
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:02.920]  in the system.
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.840]  You know the new world order, this globalist system, NAFTA, GATT, the open borders, all
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:09.800]  the taxes, the regulations.
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:16.200]  Every time you follow what you're told will fix things, things get worse.
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.860]  And it's only going to get worse because this is a post-industrial model.
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:21.420]  That's what the globalists want.
[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:23.080]  That's what their plans are.
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:24.360]  That's what they push.
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:26.280]  That's what's in their international agreements.
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:28.320]  That's what's under UN law.
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:36.760]  It is a tiny elite waging war against civilization because they're in a race to shut down civilization
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:41.580]  for the general public before we get the life extension technologies.
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:43.000]  They're threatened by technology.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.680]  They're threatened by education.
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:45.960]  They're threatened by it.
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:49.720]  So they replace it with facsimiles.
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:52.960]  Instead of enlightenment, they give you rote regurgitation.
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:58.400]  Instead of real private property, they make you debt slaves with property taxes.
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:03.200]  Everything is a facsimile or a counterfeit, a dry, it's like, you ever seen fake food?
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:07.400]  They got like fake bread, fake pudding, restaurants have it to show you what their dishes look
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:08.400]  like.
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:11.200]  It may look like pumpkin pie.
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:21.080]  It may look like cheese enchiladas, but it's not, it's wax.
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:24.760]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:27.360]  Alex, great show today.
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:32.560]  I just want to disagree with the previous caller who said that calling into radio shows
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:34.800]  is in a meaningful form of activism.
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.040]  I think right now, leading up to the caucuses, we can all get a lot done if we call into
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:41.280]  local shows in Iowa.
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:42.280]  That's right.
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:47.160]  You're the funk master five guy on YouTube and you personally have called all the big
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:53.120]  shows reaching tens of millions of people on Limbaugh, you name it, PluggingInfoWars.com,
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:54.760]  Plugging Ron Paul.
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:59.920]  You as one man have been a wrecking crew and a testament to using talk radio.
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:04.240]  That's why they've got so many call screeners and people, it's an act of Congress to get
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:08.540]  on those shows to make sure what you say is within the paradigm.
[02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:12.600]  The quickest way to get on is to call in and act like a dumb liberal.
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:16.400]  Call in, say you love communism and everything, they'll put you right on to make you look
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:17.400]  stupid.
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:18.400]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:20.720]  Tell us how you get on these evil shows.
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:24.160]  Well, from show to show, it's a little different.
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:29.640]  One show you'll have to act like a liberal or another show you'll have to act like you
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:30.640]  agree with them.
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:37.200]  But if you have a good enough story you can get through, but you have to be kind and respectful
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:40.680]  when you get on their shows because if you get on there and act like an idiot or you
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:43.400]  don't have your facts straight- You can't say it real fast.
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:46.560]  You just ask like, why is Ron Paul being criticized?
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:47.560]  Huntsman's new ad, it's very interesting.
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:52.580]  You know, the Twilight Zone one, yeah, that kook, yeah, it's a kook, I mean, but I agree
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:53.580]  with you.
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:56.960]  There's no new world order even though they're, well, they're all over the news rush announcing
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:00.480]  a new banking world order run by mega banks.
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:05.700]  I mean, George Herbert Walker Bush did call for a world government, didn't he?
[02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:09.820]  And then they hang up on you and laugh at you, but everybody remembers that they did
[02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:11.280]  call for world government.
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:13.880]  So why can't Ron Paul say we don't want that?
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:14.880]  Go ahead.
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:21.440]  Well, as you know, Alex, all these neo-cons and even guys on the left are working together
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.120]  now all together in concert to demonize and they're turning the attack machine on Ron
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:29.120]  Paul cuz they're freaking out cuz they see that he's first in the polls there.
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:33.760]  That's all you need to know that he's good is that the entire system, all the political
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:39.040]  prostitutes from every angle, it's always been about covering all the political bases
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:43.400]  to make people think they had a choice, but they're all on the same team.
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:49.520]  Well, and if you listen to any of those shows, you hear they're being inundated, overrun
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:54.120]  by Ron Paul supporters, all intricately making their point.
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.320]  Some of the people on there are a little ill prepared.
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:49:00.660]  I do urge people after you're done listening to Alex, after his show's over, call some
[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:04.140]  of these shows, have your points ready, use the information.
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:06.620]  Like Alex says, the information is easy to find out there.
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:07.920]  It's all over the place.
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.000]  Their sources, their very own sources have the information.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.000]  Use that, support them.
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.400]  I mean, we are running out of time, we have one day until the caucus, we really need to
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:16.400]  get on these shows.
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:19.600]  There's shows all through the day, shows that haven't even come on yet.
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:22.880]  Later on, I'm gonna be on all day, all night until the caucus is called.
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:26.680]  Exactly, and again, people say, well, they'll just cheat us with the electronic machines
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:28.320]  and then that will come out.
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:32.920]  Again, if you don't force their hand, you don't expose them.
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:38.360]  And again, we're winning just by Ron Paul exposing the private Federal Reserve.
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:43.880]  We're winning, look, they are attacking Ron Paul now because they can't ignore him.
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:47.440]  But every time he goes on a show, if I was him, I'd say, I've already answered all this
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:50.780]  newsletter stuff, and I've already answered about how we shouldn't have to pay for people's
[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:51.780]  sexual behavior.
[02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:56.080]  They should have to pay for it themselves, just like smokers should have to pay for their
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:58.360]  own lung cancer.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:03.780]  Why when you have other people on do you let them talk about their issues and their policies?
[02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:04.980]  But with me, you don't.
[02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:09.120]  There's a reason, same reason the media gives me the least amount of time in the debates
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:13.860]  and tried to tell people I couldn't win, because you're scared of me.
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:18.120]  And Ron Paul's doing it more, I've told him on air, I've told him off air.
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:22.480]  He needs to toot his horn and say, I warned you about all this for 30 years, now it's
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:23.480]  happening.
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:29.080]  But Ron Paul, everything he talked about coming is now happening right as he's catapulted.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.000]  And let me agree with you, Robert, he is on fire right now.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:38.600]  I mean, the Ron Paul phenomenon, and again, he's just a focal point of liberty.
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:39.920]  We're winning.
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:44.120]  Okay, the tyrants pass a law saying they can arrest us for no reason.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:47.640]  But they're trying to hide that because they know it's illegitimate.
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:51.600]  That discredits them as confirming everything we said.
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:56.980]  I'm glad they passed the NDAA and show us what pigs they are, what New World Order tyrants
[02:50:56.980 --> 02:50:59.240]  they are, what little Hitler's they are.
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:00.240]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:01.880]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:07.880]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough, an easy, natural, organic way to bring relief to diabetics.
[02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:12.160]  Introducing MDS Forte, a concentrated super strength extract formulated for those who
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:13.440]  are looking for relief.
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:15.400]  What can MDS Forte do for you?
[02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:20.560]  MDS Forte reduces glucose levels safely and effectively, reduces cholesterol and triglyceride
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:25.200]  levels, increases HDL or good cholesterol while reducing LDL or bad cholesterol.
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:30.520]  MDS Forte reduces A1C, improves eyesight and circulation to the limbs, and helps with weight
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:31.520]  loss.
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:37.200]  It's non-toxic, caffeine free, 100% natural, 100% organic, and comes with a 100% money
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:38.800]  back guarantee.
[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:40.680]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers?
[02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:43.160]  With MDS Forte, there are none.
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:55.800]  Order a 25-day treatment of MDS Forte by calling 213-405-5355, 213-405-5355, or visit bestbloodsupport.com.
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:52:01.160]  That's bestbloodsupport.com for MDS Forte, a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:07.320]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:08.320]  back on?
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:12.340]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never
[02:52:12.340 --> 02:52:16.080]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:17.240]  Here's why.
[02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:21.640]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:23.240]  of our oldest sponsors.
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:28.040]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:33.400]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:34.440]  from the sun.
[02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:38.280]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:42.580]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[02:52:42.580 --> 02:52:44.280]  power outages again.
[02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:48.440]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:49.840]  Solutions from Science.
[02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:52.920]  Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:53:02.100]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:06.960]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases, cancer, arthritis,
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:08.600]  heart disease, and Parkinson's?
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:12.320]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione
[02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:18.280]  to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive
[02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:25.840]  diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, in all at least 68 diseases.
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:29.480]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione
[02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:30.480]  production?
[02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:33.820]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:53:33.820 --> 02:53:37.440]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein.
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:41.760]  All other whey protein powders are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:45.880]  One World Whey's most life-giving whey protein powder ever produced.
[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:48.700]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:48.700 --> 02:53:54.220]  That's 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[02:53:54.220 --> 02:54:04.440]  That's oneworldwhey.com.
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:10.040]  I'll tell you one thing, it is a really exciting time to be alive right now.
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:13.800]  People that talk about how they're bored, you're bored because you play video games
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:15.520]  and watch TV all day, folks.
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:20.500]  If you're a new listener out there, reality is all around you.
[02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:27.080]  And this is a time to choose which side you're on, liberty or tyranny, it's on.
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:31.000]  And I am just so excited to be alive.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.080]  And you think about all the people that are going along with this corruption, going along
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:41.280]  with this new world order, going along with the NDAA and all the rest of it.
[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:44.440]  Think about how discredited they're gonna be in the future.
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:49.680]  They're gonna be known as the Nazi sympathizers, as the global sympathizers.
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:52.440]  We're gonna beat these people, we should be very excited.
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:56.980]  Yeah, they're trying to start a new war, and they're so threatened by the public, they're
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:54:59.200]  passing the NDAA.
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:02.520]  And I wish Congress would have done the right thing and killed that.
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:09.040]  But we're gonna make lemonade out of lemons, okay, this is gonna expose you, and it has.
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:14.320]  I cannot stress to you, we're gonna do five minutes of overdraft to finish the calls.
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:22.000]  I cannot stress to you enough how big this awakening is, how much people are getting
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.880]  and apologizing to me.
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:27.960]  You wait till the next shoes start dropping.
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:33.600]  We've warned so many people, Ron Paul has and others, that as the globalists try to
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  implement this stuff, it is not gonna go well for them.
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:44.880]  And if it does go to armed conflict, which I pray it doesn't, look what this one guy
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:45.880]  did.
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:50.180]  Yeah, they had hundreds and hundreds of police and people to deal with him.
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:53.760]  And they waited a day while he was dead in a ditch, they were so scared to go up where
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:54.760]  his car was.
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:59.280]  I mean, if the New World Order thinks people like that are gonna be able to go up against
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:01.640]  the American people, uh-uh.
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:09.200]  They can crush somebody like me easy, okay, I'm committed to this cause, whatever.
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:12.600]  I won't enjoy it, but that's just the way it is.
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:16.840]  My shields are down, here I am, destroy me.
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:20.520]  But you cannot destroy the spirit of liberty.
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.920]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come, and the idea of liberty.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:29.120]  We've tried tyranny, we've tried big government, we've tried globalism.
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:35.840]  It stinks, and they're trying to sell us more globalism as the solution to all of this.
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:37.160]  Now is the time to get involved.
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:42.400]  Now is the time to get prisonplanet.tv memberships, we've got a 15-day free trial running again.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.420]  You can go watch excerpts of it for free, thetopofinfowars.com, just click the Watch
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:48.000]  Now button.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.960]  You can download topics and videos on any subject you can imagine and give them to people.
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:54.560]  You can get our YouTube videos that are seen by millions.
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.280]  You wanna give somebody an eight-minute video breaking down the NDAA?
[02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:05.360]  We've got one up there on our YouTube channel right now, Obama Signs Martial Law Bill.
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:09.200]  You can get all 18 of my films on DVD, I've done three hours and I haven't even plugged
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.200]  videos yet.
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:16.720]  You can get all of my films for 99.95, 18 films, support us, but more importantly have
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:19.440]  films to give friends and family and wake people up.
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  Almost every caller that calls here was woken up by somebody giving them a film or giving
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:28.880]  them the website.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:34.400]  The ground psychologically, mentally, spiritually has never been more fertile for truth than
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.640]  it is now.
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:43.400]  And Ron Paul is our omni-budsman, our aging Gandalf out there facing the bullrag right
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:44.920]  now.
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:49.920]  And in the process of what he goes through and the attacks and him exhausting himself
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.760]  on this worthy cause, you can tell he's tired.
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:58.020]  I can see it coming, his life force being spent.

[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:21.080]  about Mitt Romney he's withholding this tax information and it seems that he's
[03:00:21.080 --> 03:00:25.600]  uh considering a 2.5 million dollar refund and of course this is tied in
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:30.240]  with everything happen with the bailouts and being being tied to AIG and Bear
[03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:35.880]  Stearns and you know the whole George Bush and Nancy Pelosi thing and you know
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:38.960]  this is gonna turn him down because he's involved with the fraud but the
[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:46.520]  derivatives of that's right Mitt Romney is a ringer just like John Kerry was for
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:53.880]  Bush just like Bob Dole was for Clinton he is an absolute ringer and wrote
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:59.080]  Obamacare loves abortion he this just shows you how sick mainline Republicans
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:02.920]  are I mean they're just as wicked as wicked Obama supporters they're just

[03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:05.880]  Ron Paul caucus state surveyor good job thank you and we're trying our hardest
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:11.280]  a couple things I wanted to go over real quick right here in Fort lost in the
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:15.720]  woods Missouri that's where they do all the MP training for military I have a
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:19.480]  buddy who works for a contractor that's doing some work on the military base
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:25.400]  right now and there is a sign in front of the facility that is civilian
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:30.360]  internment work camp training facility and this is where they bring all of the
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:35.640]  MPs to train them on how to detain us basically no I knew that it was that the
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:39.160]  one big part of the FEMA takeover is the civilian inmate labor camp program that
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:43.360]  was declassified in 97 by Clinton but you're saying they've actually got it in
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:46.360]  front of the camp yeah they have a sign right in front of the camp and there's
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:49.440]  guards and there's nobody in there but they're just at the training facility
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:55.040]  you do me a favor yeah now we're getting everybody's number can I get your name
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:59.320]  and number off air and and and give us all the info just so I can show people
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:03.400]  that or could you get over there and take a photo of it I'm actually working
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:07.840]  on that right now I'm trying to get a picture for you so okay what's the name
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:12.960]  of the what's the name of the fort again it's Fort Leonard Wood okay that's a big
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:17.040]  one which entrance is that which entrance is that I'm not sure which
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:20.800]  entrance it is but there is he said there's also a bigger compound that is
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:25.400]  empty right now that they're still doing construction on so I guess that would be
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:29.400]  an actual camp and then the building that he's talking about is a training
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:35.120]  facility so and then it's basically freaky to me too because we got we're
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:40.160]  real small right here in Missouri especially in this area now another thing
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:43.440]  too that I wanted to talk about my wife we're going like the town that I live in
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:47.000]  is real small in Missouri I mean very small less than 2,000 people but at a
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:52.120]  stoplight there was four same model cars different colors that had USGN license
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:56.160]  plates on them and when I came back home cuz I keep my eyes open I looked it up
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:01.760]  and it's actually us global nano space and they make this map sand thing that
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:07.360]  is just freaky but what it is is map sands is a completely autonomous
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:11.360]  perimeter security and non-lethal defense system and if you look at this
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:14.760]  company it is unreal I don't understand what they would even be doing in this
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:21.360]  small part of Missouri basically a plus in robot defense parameter systems yeah
[03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:26.000]  it's freaky and they also make ballistic panels for helicopters and Humvees and
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:32.360]  all kinds of crazy things a lot of a lot of talk a lot of military traffic in the
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:36.480]  air and on the highways out this way these days too oh yeah well that whole
[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:41.200]  area is crawling with COG Wow well somebody needs to get over there and get
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:45.800]  photos of that no the FEMA camps are real NDAA is law but again they're gonna
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:49.960]  have a roll out of this whole thing they're gonna have a way that they bring
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:53.800]  it all out to try to sell it it's not gonna just be overnight boom it happens
