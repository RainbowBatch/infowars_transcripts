[00:00.000 --> 00:27.200]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, June 7th, 2015.
[00:27.200 --> 00:32.200]  I'm David Knight. I'll be your host here in the studio. Alex Jones is going to be co-hosting with us today.
[00:32.200 --> 00:38.200]  He's going to be joining us in the next segment to break down something that we just found out about.
[00:38.200 --> 00:40.200]  Of course, we see all these international agreements that are being made.
[00:40.200 --> 00:47.200]  One of these international agreements that is coming not from the trade treaties, but it's actually coming from the State Department.
[00:47.200 --> 00:54.200]  See, we have all these bureaucracies that are writing rules and regulations that have the effect of law.
[00:54.200 --> 00:58.200]  They've already bypassed our elected representatives in so many areas.
[00:58.200 --> 01:07.200]  It's hardly even a surprise that we've got now sovereignty changing massive agreements that aren't just about trade and they certainly aren't about free trade.
[01:07.200 --> 01:10.200]  They're about a crony capitalism kind of trade.
[01:10.200 --> 01:17.200]  This is what we saw with the banker bailouts. This is the kind of quote unquote free trade that we're getting with these trade agreements.
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.200]  But we see these regulations coming in from various bureaucracies all of the time, writing their own laws.
[01:23.200 --> 01:32.200]  Congress creates these organizations like the EPA, like the IRS, like the ATF, all these different organizations that then go off and write their rules.
[01:32.200 --> 01:40.200]  The FCC coming out and taking over the Internet, for example, just claiming that they have control over it and they're now going to rewrite the rules.
[01:40.200 --> 01:48.200]  So they're going to exert control. It wasn't even given to them by Congress. They just claim it, name it and claim it, and then they start writing rules for it.
[01:48.200 --> 01:56.200]  So now we've got the State Department who's coming out and saying that they're going to have regulations that are going to govern international arms trade.
[01:56.200 --> 02:02.200]  That sounds familiar, doesn't it? Remember the UN arms trade treaty that they tried so many times to get through?
[02:02.200 --> 02:10.200]  They actually called it a treaty. Maybe that's why they couldn't get it through. They made the mistake of not calling it an agreement or a partnership.
[02:10.200 --> 02:22.200]  Now we're going to talk about why these trade agreements are really treaties. And of course, I'm very happy to see now Rand Paul and Senator Jeff Sessions always get him confused with Pete Sessions.
[02:22.200 --> 02:31.200]  Pete Sessions is on the wrong side of this, folks. He's a congressman and he is pushing for a fast-tracked agreement for trade treaties that he has not read.
[02:31.200 --> 02:43.200]  Pete Sessions, Senator Sessions, is a hero on this. He's gone to actually read this, as has Rand Paul, and they're both speaking out on this saying that this is not a trade agreement.
[02:43.200 --> 02:50.200]  This is in fact a treaty. This whole thing is treachery, quite frankly.
[02:50.200 --> 02:57.200]  It is treachery to even call it something other than a treaty because they didn't have the votes to pass fast-track if it was a treaty.
[02:57.200 --> 03:04.200]  They had 62 votes. If they came up and honestly said that this was a treaty, they would have needed 67 votes.
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.200]  That's why they called it an agreement. That's why they called it a partnership. And of course, NAFTA was passed that way.
[03:08.200 --> 03:19.200]  They called it the North American Free Trade Agreement. But now if you go back and look at what they're telling people when it comes up to investor state tribunals,
[03:19.200 --> 03:28.200]  the same thing that we now see being applied with these Trans-Pacific, Transatlantic partnerships, these tribunals, I guess we should call them IS, right?
[03:28.200 --> 03:37.200]  Investor state. It's another kind of IS, also created by the same people. But these tribunals, they say, really are treaty law claims.
[03:37.200 --> 03:47.200]  So the people who are representing the corporations, the multinational corporations in these arbitration agreements are quite clear about the fact that they are practicing treaty law.
[03:47.200 --> 03:56.200]  Look, treaty is any kind of an agreement between one or more nations that affects commerce or peace or various other aspects.
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.200]  This is a treaty. So the first thing they do is lie about it being a treaty so they don't have to get the votes.
[04:01.200 --> 04:07.200]  Senator Sessions has seen this. He's written a very scathing letter. We're going to talk about that in detail in the next segment.
[04:07.200 --> 04:14.200]  Alex Jones is going to be co-hosting with us throughout this hour. He's going to be talking about this particular instance with the State Department.
[04:14.200 --> 04:21.200]  This is essentially, according to the NRA, they're saying that this is a gag order on firearms-related speech.
[04:21.200 --> 04:31.200]  In other words, they're going to come after you with some pretty heavy, very draconian penalties if you start putting out technical publications about firearms.
[04:31.200 --> 04:39.200]  And of course, this could be extended to anything. This is a way of destroying the Second Amendment using the First Amendment.
[04:39.200 --> 04:47.200]  And these are regulations that are being passed by the State Department. Stay with us in the next segment. Alex Jones is going to break this down. Be right back.
[05:09.200 --> 05:20.200]  The NRA trade package is beginning to unravel, with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and the Republican leadership over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs
[05:20.200 --> 05:24.200]  and hand big corporations new powers that would violate national sovereignty.
[05:24.200 --> 05:30.200]  Hunting for hackers. NSA secretly expands Internet spying at U.S. border, article by New York Times.
[05:30.200 --> 05:41.200]  Without public notice or debate, the Obama administration has expanded the NSA's warless surveillance of Americans' international Internet traffic according to a classified NSA document.
[05:41.200 --> 05:55.200]  In mid-2012, Justice Department lawyers wrote two secret memos, permitting the spy agency to begin hunting on Internet cables without a warrant and on American soil for data linked to computer intrusions originating abroad.
[05:55.200 --> 06:02.200]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[06:25.200 --> 06:39.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:55.200 --> 07:15.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 7th day of June 2015. This is an emergency report dealing not just with the Second Amendment, but with every basic human liberty that is now under open naked attack.
[07:15.200 --> 07:29.200]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is a live radio broadcast. We're going to be throwing it in a moment to David Knight, who is live in studio in Austin, Texas, co-hosting with me the Sunday syndicated transmission.
[07:29.200 --> 07:43.200]  We'll also post this emergency alert to YouTube as well, and we're begging everyone out there to please go to infowars.com, click on the article, go to the NRA website and see this for yourself.
[07:43.200 --> 08:04.200]  Remember last year, Cody Wilson, fellow Austinite, developed a 3D printable gun, an AR-15, and the feds came after him and said, you can't put a file out, just digital information on how to build that or we're going to indict you.
[08:04.200 --> 08:19.200]  And we warned them that the feds were going to claim that basically any type of written information about reloading, about how to fix any type of firearm, you name it, would be basically seen as the anarchist cookbook and that information itself was terrorist.
[08:19.200 --> 08:33.200]  This is prior restraint. Well, now the NRA, who's very conservative and always very slow to act, has come out from their hill contacts and Obama's promised a raft of executive powers outside of law to restrict the Second Amendment.
[08:33.200 --> 08:46.200]  They've now come out, stories on infowars.com, and announced they're coming after the Second Amendment, not just with ammo restrictions, not just with the attempt that they've been announcing to ban some of the 556 ammo.
[08:46.200 --> 08:56.200]  But no, now they're saying they're going after the literature, everything, and that you'll have to get permission before you communicate about guns, period, on the Internet.
[08:56.200 --> 09:11.200]  They've also announced in two different congressional hearings that they want to bring back the quote, Fairness Doctrine, coming to USA Freedom Act, it's a horrible name, it's very Orwellian, the Fairness Doctrine to not let people on talk radio or print actually say their political views.
[09:11.200 --> 09:25.200]  You're like, that'll never happen. Really, until 1987, when Bruce Fine, head counsel of the FCC, got rid of it, our guest Bruce Fine, until that was done, talk radio didn't even exist.
[09:25.200 --> 09:33.200]  So we're going into this, the Internet Kill Switch, the FCC Takeover of the Web, they've had Zuckerberg, a Facebook meeting with the Communist Chinese in the U.S., how to do this?
[09:33.200 --> 09:44.200]  It's in the TPP, that part's been leaked, the borders are open without any type of law, the power plants are being shut off outside of law, they're just power-grabbing.
[09:44.200 --> 09:53.200]  Michelle Obama tells our kids what to eat in schools outside of law, and if the schools don't follow it, they're fined outside of law, they just do whatever they want.
[09:53.200 --> 10:04.200]  Here's the article on infowars.com, absolutely critically important, NRA, gun blogs, videos, web forums threatened by new Obama regulation.
[10:04.200 --> 10:20.200]  When you read the article by the Washington Examiner, it links to the NRA story at the NRA website, breaking it down to the announcement, June 3rd took us four or five days to find out about this, federal register.
[10:20.200 --> 10:30.200]  And that is where they are announcing it, so they just publish things in the federal register, they just do whatever they want in everyone's face.
[10:30.200 --> 10:38.200]  But notice, if you go to infowars.com, or even mainstream media websites, it's the same story over and over again.
[10:38.200 --> 10:47.200]  Rand Paul demands White House release trade deal text immediately, see, again, dictatorial centralized power outside of law, just do whatever they want.
[10:47.200 --> 10:55.200]  And thank God Rand Paul is saying, no, you must release it, I demand you do it, that's what a statesman would do, no one else even dares do that.
[10:55.200 --> 11:03.200]  Obama on his amnesty, the law is on our side, when he said he, quote, changed the law.
[11:03.200 --> 11:12.200]  No, Congress never passed the amnesty, he's done it by executive fiat, so it's more deception over and over and over again.
[11:12.200 --> 11:24.200]  Let's continue. Now, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dempsey says Putin intends to undermine Ukraine and NATO, when clearly, you can say what you want about Russian corruption, it's certainly there.
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.200]  The West is on their border, messing with them.
[11:28.200 --> 11:44.200]  So again, it's all part of this lawlessness, all part of this recklessness by the elite we have here, and Obama has previously promised at least 16 different initiatives to go after the Second Amendment.
[11:44.200 --> 11:50.200]  They're now saying they're just going to put anybody who's ever been to a psychologist basically and ever claimed insurance on it.
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.200]  They're going to claim you have a disability and restrict buying guns, then they're going to make you turn them in.
[11:55.200 --> 12:00.200]  This is already being selectively tested in states like California and New York.
[12:00.200 --> 12:06.200]  So the establishment is making their move to sew up the United States and consolidate total control.
[12:06.200 --> 12:24.200]  If people don't get upset about this outrageous move that the feds are now saying in a comment period, oh yeah, we're getting ready to, I mean, if you go to Barnes & Noble, it's reloading magazines, designs of guns, how to fix them.
[12:24.200 --> 12:26.200]  They're saying, no, no, no, you can't have those.
[12:26.200 --> 12:36.200]  And I remember the old timers always saying when they start going after gun manuals, when they start going after gun technicals, when they start trying to restrict that, get ready, they're coming after the guns in general.
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.200]  They're trying to kill the Second Amendment, right to keep bare arms.
[12:39.200 --> 12:51.200]  Culture, I'm going to throw it now live to David Knight in the studio, and I'm going to be back at the bottom of the hour with a very important message and information on the agenda of Bilderberg 2015.
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.200]  Then I'll be back at the end to get more into TPP.
[12:55.200 --> 12:57.200]  But all of this connects together.
[12:57.200 --> 13:03.200]  Centralized dictatorial power where arbitrary tyrannical groups can do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[13:03.200 --> 13:24.200]  All right, we take you now to the Infowars.com news studios and David Knight.
[13:24.200 --> 13:25.200]  And here's the deal.
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.200]  This is all regulations being put out by the State Department.
[13:29.200 --> 13:32.200]  Regulations that would govern international arms sales, they say.
[13:32.200 --> 13:40.200]  So because this is something that's going across international lines and because, of course, the Internet is international, they would come after the Internet.
[13:40.200 --> 13:48.200]  They say that any technical violations of this, people would face up to $1 million and 20 years in jail.
[13:48.200 --> 13:50.200]  That's how draconian these regulations are.
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.200]  Think about how they're coming after us just in this one area.
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.200]  Look at the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
[13:57.200 --> 14:00.200]  Look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.200]  These are all things that can be used to stifle, to control firearms.
[14:05.200 --> 14:14.200]  We also have the FCC and the State Department then coming after the Internet, after free speech, after technical information.
[14:14.200 --> 14:17.200]  Understand that the UN Arms Trade Treaty, they put that together.
[14:17.200 --> 14:25.200]  It was admitted by the New York Times that Fast and Furious was a false flag attack designed to discredit the Second Amendment.
[14:25.200 --> 14:28.200]  And of course, what did Fast and Furious involve?
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.200]  It involved shipping arms across the border between the United States and Mexico.
[14:33.200 --> 14:38.200]  That was supposed to justify the UN Arms Trade Treaty for the American people.
[14:38.200 --> 14:40.200]  That was going to be their false flag.
[14:40.200 --> 14:47.200]  Instead, when a federal agent got killed in this and it blew up in their face, that was discredited.
[14:47.200 --> 14:50.200]  So they have tried to push this through in various ways.
[14:50.200 --> 14:52.200]  Many people believe that they will push it through.
[14:52.200 --> 14:58.200]  Perhaps it might be part of these trade partnerships, the Trans-Atlantic, the Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[14:58.200 --> 15:01.200]  That might include restrictions on it that they would then use to say,
[15:01.200 --> 15:07.200]  well, since we have to track the flow of firearms across borders by treaty,
[15:07.200 --> 15:13.200]  that means we have to get all this information about you, about your firearms.
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.200]  We have to create this database so that we can do our work and enforce this treaty.
[15:17.200 --> 15:20.200]  That's the rationale that they would use for that.
[15:20.200 --> 15:25.200]  Now, of course, if this isn't in the Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic partnerships,
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.200]  understand that it can be added after these things have been passed.
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.200]  That's one of the things that's so outrageous about these partnership agreements,
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.200]  is that we cannot only not see it before it's passed,
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.200]  that the elected representatives of ours cannot modify it or amend it,
[15:43.200 --> 15:49.200]  but that it will be easily amended without any input from the Congress after it is passed.
[15:49.200 --> 15:52.200]  We have to pass it so that they can change it.
[15:52.200 --> 15:54.200]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back.
[15:54.200 --> 16:20.200]  As the root of these Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[16:25.200 --> 16:52.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[16:52.200 --> 16:59.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[17:22.200 --> 17:48.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[17:48.200 --> 18:16.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[18:16.200 --> 18:45.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[18:45.200 --> 19:13.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[19:13.200 --> 19:29.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[19:29.200 --> 19:58.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[19:59.200 --> 20:27.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[20:27.200 --> 20:53.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[20:53.200 --> 21:21.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[21:21.200 --> 21:47.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[21:47.200 --> 22:15.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[22:15.200 --> 22:43.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[22:43.200 --> 23:11.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[23:11.200 --> 23:33.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[23:33.200 --> 24:01.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[24:01.200 --> 24:27.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[24:27.200 --> 24:55.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[24:55.200 --> 25:23.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[25:23.200 --> 25:51.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[25:51.200 --> 26:19.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[26:19.200 --> 26:47.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[26:47.200 --> 27:13.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[27:13.200 --> 27:41.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[27:41.200 --> 28:09.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[28:09.200 --> 28:37.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[28:37.200 --> 28:59.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[28:59.200 --> 29:27.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[29:27.200 --> 29:55.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[29:55.200 --> 30:23.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[30:23.200 --> 30:51.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[30:51.200 --> 31:19.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[31:19.200 --> 31:47.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[31:47.200 --> 32:15.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[32:15.200 --> 32:43.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[32:43.200 --> 33:07.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[33:13.200 --> 33:35.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[33:35.200 --> 34:03.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[34:03.200 --> 34:31.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[34:31.200 --> 34:59.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[34:59.200 --> 35:27.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.

[37:47.200 --> 38:15.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[38:15.200 --> 38:43.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[38:43.200 --> 39:11.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.

[39:39.200 --> 40:07.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[40:07.200 --> 40:35.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[40:35.200 --> 41:03.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[41:03.200 --> 41:31.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[41:31.200 --> 41:59.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[41:59.200 --> 42:27.200]  Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific Trans-Pacific partnerships.
