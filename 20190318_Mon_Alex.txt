[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  It's Monday, March 18, 2019.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.320]  Facebook is run by the CIA and DARPA.
[00:11.320 --> 00:30.320]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Ries.
[00:30.320 --> 00:37.800]  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, otherwise known as DARPA, has been named by
[00:37.800 --> 00:44.120]  several whistleblowers to be the leading innovator in trauma-based mind control.
[00:44.120 --> 00:50.240]  In 2002, DARPA announced their ambitious IAO program.
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.760]  The Information Awareness Office was set up to gather and store the personal information
[00:55.760 --> 01:02.320]  of everyone in the United States, including credit card and phone records.
[01:02.320 --> 01:08.320]  Following strong public criticism that the IAO was blatant mass surveillance, it was
[01:08.320 --> 01:12.400]  officially defunded by Congress in 2003.
[01:12.400 --> 01:19.360]  In the Global Surveillance Disclosures of 2013, it was revealed that several IAO projects
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.400]  continue to be funded under different names.
[01:23.400 --> 01:28.440]  Life Log In its white paper, DARPA's Dr. Doug Gage
[01:28.440 --> 01:35.200]  stated that the objective of Life Log was to trace the threads of an individual's life.
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.800]  Life Log was going to require each individual user to voluntarily record everything they
[01:40.800 --> 01:49.280]  do in life, producing a unique timeline that would constitute an episodic memory.
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.800]  Out of this endless ocean of information, DARPA scientists would plot distinctive patterns,
[01:55.800 --> 02:02.280]  mapping out personal relationships, scheduled events, and researchers from DARPA's artificial
[02:02.280 --> 02:09.080]  intelligence sector would feed the data to their machines so the AI computers could study
[02:09.080 --> 02:14.360]  everyone's daily habits and make sense of it.
[02:14.360 --> 02:20.400]  Civil libertarians attacked the project when it launched, arguing the obvious privacy issues
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.480]  involved with having DARPA keeping such close tabs on the entire population.
[02:26.480 --> 02:33.400]  On February 4th, 2004, they announced the end of Life Log.
[02:33.400 --> 02:39.840]  And on that very same day, Facebook was born.
[02:39.840 --> 02:45.280]  Within a few months, Sean Parker became the first president of Facebook, and according
[02:45.280 --> 02:53.200]  to his Wikipedia page, Sean Parker was recruited by the CIA just before finishing high school.
[02:53.200 --> 03:00.080]  As president of Facebook, Sean Parker brought on their first big investor, Peter Thiel.
[03:00.080 --> 03:06.920]  Around the same time that Life Log was created, CIA investment group NQTEL helped Peter Thiel
[03:06.920 --> 03:14.520]  form Palantir Technologies, a company that analyzed massive databases of public information
[03:14.520 --> 03:20.120]  used by the CIA and other offices of the US intelligence community.
[03:20.120 --> 03:26.440]  Peter Thiel brought in investor James Breyer, who at the same time was on the board of directors
[03:26.440 --> 03:36.200]  for military defense contractor BBN, along with CIA-run NQTEL CEO Gilman Louie.
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.560]  With several close connections to the CIA, Facebook went on to accomplish everything
[03:41.560 --> 03:47.000]  that Life Log hoped to execute, and all with the appearances of being a private company
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.120]  run by co-creator Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:51.120 --> 03:57.200]  Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last April in a grand spectacle that displayed
[03:57.200 --> 04:03.120]  him more like an alien robot than the shrewd business mogul of the world's biggest social
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.960]  media platform.
[04:05.960 --> 04:10.880]  And now, federal prosecutors are investigating deals that Facebook made with some of the
[04:10.880 --> 04:14.920]  world's largest tech companies.
[04:14.920 --> 04:18.960]  Top executives are leaving the company.
[04:18.960 --> 04:25.040]  Director Cheryl Sandberg has sold over $15 million in Facebook shares over the past
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.880]  few weeks.
[04:27.880 --> 04:35.000]  On Wednesday, March 13, Facebook and Instagram went down around the globe.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  The initial claim of an accidental traffic jam issue with a European internet company
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.320]  was quickly refuted by third-party firm Thousand Eyes, who says the outage appears to be an
[04:48.320 --> 04:50.760]  internal problem.
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.640]  Facebook later claimed it was due to a server configuration change.
[04:55.640 --> 05:13.560]  The full report's up on infowars.com, stay with us.
