[00:00.000 --> 00:08.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[00:08.640 --> 00:13.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:13.480 --> 00:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 24th day of August, 2015, I'm Alex Jones coming
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.120]  to you with a recorded report from Monday morning, about an hour and a half before the
[00:28.120 --> 00:30.080]  broadcast starts.
[00:30.080 --> 00:36.520]  I will be calling in live later via a connection in Chicago.
[00:36.520 --> 00:40.760]  David Knight will be hosting the broadcast.
[00:40.760 --> 00:48.760]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we saw Asian stock markets plunge massively in their trading.
[00:48.760 --> 00:53.400]  Now, we will have more intel as the U.S. stock market opens.
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.680]  Obviously, by the time you hear this report, the stock market has opened.
[00:59.680 --> 01:11.000]  In the futures market, the stock market was down 800 plus points in the futures market.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.560]  Falling market tie is lowering all boats around the world.
[01:15.560 --> 01:22.640]  Oil has sunk in its price yet again, another 4%.
[01:22.640 --> 01:29.360]  This is massive, but regardless of all the current technicals, it's key to understand
[01:29.360 --> 01:35.480]  that infowars.com and our family of guests and researchers absolutely predicted this
[01:35.480 --> 01:36.480]  with precision.
[01:36.480 --> 01:42.320]  It's not about the laurels that we predicted what is happening, it's about the fact that
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.280]  we know what the problem is and we know how to fix it.
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.600]  That's why we chewed our horn and explained that we're the ones that expose this more
[01:50.600 --> 01:52.600]  accurately than anybody else.
[01:52.600 --> 01:59.600]  This is orchestrated global financial consolidation and the globalists are giving themselves
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.920]  the literally hundreds of trillions in different currencies by devaluing the currencies and
[02:05.920 --> 02:08.440]  giving themselves first use of it.
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.280]  They are also, through the private central banks, consolidating control, giving themselves
[02:13.280 --> 02:15.200]  0% interest.
[02:15.200 --> 02:17.880]  They are rigging all the major markets.
[02:17.880 --> 02:25.560]  Rates come out in the news that the stock markets are rigged, that the rates are rigged, that
[02:25.560 --> 02:30.200]  the entire system, the currency markets are rigged.
[02:30.200 --> 02:36.160]  Beyond that, they are now going to hold everyone hostage as this global financial crisis deepens,
[02:36.160 --> 02:43.760]  wait for it, win the yuppies and the retirees and everybody else sees that their 401ks are
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.120]  massively devalued here in the next few weeks.
[02:48.120 --> 02:53.640]  As the stimulus fails to work by design, as this bubble begins to implode, they're going
[02:53.640 --> 03:01.080]  to come in and call for a global rescue package and world emergency summits of the G20 and
[03:01.080 --> 03:07.800]  of central banks to offer their solution, accelerated integration of Asia, Europe and
[03:07.800 --> 03:17.680]  the Americas, accelerated cooperation and a global stimulus emergency package of $100
[03:17.680 --> 03:24.520]  trillion over the next 10 years to help finance recovery.
[03:24.520 --> 03:29.280]  That money will then be selectively given from one hand to the other, from one hand
[03:29.280 --> 03:38.640]  to the globalist, from the other hand to selectively only develop economic operations in sectors
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.160]  that they're in control and then you will get jobs working for them.
[03:43.160 --> 03:46.840]  It's the same thing they've done in the third world over and over and over again.
[03:46.840 --> 03:48.720]  This formulae is known.
[03:48.720 --> 03:54.520]  We got the IMF World Bank documents in 2002 where they said, next, we're going to start
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.520]  doing this to the West.
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.600]  Then I told you five years ago, I talked to a millionaire, a major defense contractor
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.920]  owner, and they said, look, within five years, there won't be an America.
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.920]  I said, what do you mean?
[04:06.920 --> 04:11.800]  They said, you know what I mean, listen to your own show, it's dead on, you're going
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.200]  to be very, very famous if you can basically stay alive.
[04:16.200 --> 04:20.200]  You've heard all the guests, you've heard the intel, you've heard it all, we've broken
[04:20.200 --> 04:21.320]  it down.
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.240]  This is engineered, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.600]  Mr. Dent just two weeks ago said it was on.
[04:27.600 --> 04:28.600]  We'll be back.
[04:28.600 --> 04:30.880]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.840]  China is the greatest bubble in history.
[04:32.840 --> 04:35.520]  It is finally coming unravel.
[04:35.520 --> 04:42.280]  That's why I am confident that we are winning within, I'd say, weeks of the global bubble
[04:42.280 --> 04:43.480]  bursting again.
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.840]  I think the US markets are going to start heading down by early September, probably peeking
[04:48.840 --> 05:00.960]  in the next week or two, so I think this is happening.
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.000]  We're being told that Snowden's window for a plea bargain deal is closing.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.960]  Bloomberg reports a national security specialist saying, many people in government believe
[05:08.960 --> 05:13.920]  that journalists who receive Snowden's material are not capable of protecting it from a competent
[05:13.920 --> 05:16.760]  and committed state level adversary.
[05:16.760 --> 05:20.440]  Even if Snowden did not give the material to others, they argue it would have been ripe
[05:20.440 --> 05:21.440]  for the picking.
[05:21.440 --> 05:23.720]  Well, isn't that true of Hillary's handling of emails?
[05:23.720 --> 05:30.040]  Didn't her violation of protocol expose above top secret data to state level adversaries?
[05:30.040 --> 05:35.800]  Snowden exposed criminal actions of our government done in the name of national security.
[05:35.800 --> 05:42.280]  Hillary compromised national security for her own convenience or to cover up her misdeeds.
[05:42.280 --> 05:46.640]  If national security is more important than the Constitution, if national security is
[05:46.640 --> 05:52.120]  more important than our rights, why isn't Hillary being prosecuted?
[05:52.120 --> 05:58.120]  Why is Snowden called a traitor and Hillary Clinton is called presidential material?
[05:58.120 --> 06:00.920]  For Infowars, I'm David Knight.
[06:00.920 --> 06:07.080]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits
