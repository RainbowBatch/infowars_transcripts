[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:40.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.880]  All right, folks, it is another live worldwide transmission. Get ready, I am your host, Alex
[00:46.880 --> 00:55.360]  Jones. We have a top professor joining us, Roman Jampolinsky, who was on with us about
[00:55.360 --> 01:04.960]  two years ago, warning of a cybernetic takeover of society. And he's going to be joining us
[01:04.960 --> 01:11.920]  for about 45 minutes in the second hour. You've got coming out where all the major pharmacological
[01:11.920 --> 01:18.400]  pills will have tracker chips in them that report back to Skynet on you. All of the appliances
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.600]  with wireless internet are watching you. That's what the CIA director said. Remember in the
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.820]  Batman before last, the one with the Joker?
[01:28.820 --> 01:37.380]  They use the sonar, they use the wireless internet on the cell phones to create a system
[01:37.380 --> 01:45.820]  that scans and maps the entire city, but that also listens to everybody. That's real technology.
[01:45.820 --> 01:53.680]  For decades, they've been using wireless internet and wireless telecommunications to scan. They've
[01:53.680 --> 02:00.480]  got receiver chips. We've had engineers on about this, where it doesn't just go out and
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.520]  transmit data and then receive data in the transmitter and receiver.
[02:05.520 --> 02:13.720]  They can have another system that when it transmits out, it bounces back just like you
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.880]  use radar to make out the shape of an aircraft, and it can look right through your walls.
[02:18.880 --> 02:24.220]  That's what I keep trying to explain to people here. This is all being announced by the way.
[02:24.220 --> 02:30.840]  This is in Wired Magazine, Washington Times, Associated Press, and you're saying what's
[02:30.840 --> 02:43.360]  to do with robot takeover? Everything is being jacked with surveillance systems by design.
[02:43.360 --> 02:47.680]  This is being set up, so we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[02:47.680 --> 02:54.320]  We also have a very interesting guest, the makers, James Lane and Richard Grove, in studio
[02:54.320 --> 03:02.600]  of a new film that we are exclusively distributing for the next three months. That is, of course,
[03:02.600 --> 03:08.880]  a state of mind that is the best film out there on the history, present, and future
[03:08.880 --> 03:18.160]  of different systems of mind control. It's very well done. It's a great tool to bring
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.440]  yourself to a higher level of understanding, but also to wake up friends and family.
[03:21.440 --> 03:27.840]  It's available on Blu-ray, I should add, not just DVD at Infowarsstore.com. And while supplies
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.560]  last, there's maybe 1,000 of them left, so we'll have to take that special off very soon.
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.760]  You can get a free DVD of American Dream, the animated film exposing the private Federal
[03:37.760 --> 03:43.760]  Reserve, very entertaining. And so that special will end as soon as those are gone. So take
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.200]  advantage of that at Infowarsstore.com. But I didn't mean to go off into a plug. They're
[03:47.200 --> 03:54.680]  going to be in studio with us here today. They're visiting us because we're going to
[03:54.680 --> 04:00.080]  tape some intros and outros and things for the 17th of July when we're going to premiere
[04:00.080 --> 04:02.200]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[04:02.200 --> 04:08.320]  Start shipping the 15th. Start shipping in about two weeks and three days on DVD. And
[04:08.320 --> 04:16.520]  then two days later, we premiere it on Infowarsnightlynews, infowarsnews.com, and prisonplanet.tv. We're
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.960]  going to premiere. We'll have the regular live news that night, or if it's taped, it'll
[04:20.960 --> 04:24.680]  be taped. Some days it's live, some days it's taped, I don't know. And then it will go into
[04:24.680 --> 04:30.200]  the special we're going to tape tonight where we talk about the film and then come back
[04:30.200 --> 04:37.480]  and forth within the film and discuss it. So that's all, again, available right now
[04:37.480 --> 04:41.280]  for purchase and to support the broadcast. And the huge nut we have to crack every month
[04:41.280 --> 04:44.560]  as well. We couldn't do any of this without your support. We are the biggest alternative
[04:44.560 --> 04:49.400]  media organization in the world right now, fighting on multimedia fronts. And I want
[04:49.400 --> 04:53.880]  to commend all the supporters and prisonplanet.tv members for making that possible. We'll be
[04:53.880 --> 05:00.840]  back with bombshell Hastings news, Snowden news, military news, you name it.
[05:00.840 --> 05:06.120]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[05:06.120 --> 05:10.920]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping

[06:08.340 --> 06:13.420]  hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic
[06:13.420 --> 06:19.060]  curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous
[06:19.060 --> 06:23.420]  heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really be a problem? eFoods Direct

[07:00.220 --> 07:04.940]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[07:04.940 --> 07:09.980]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The highest rates of diabetes,
[07:09.980 --> 07:17.180]  autism and every other major disease. It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[07:17.180 --> 07:22.900]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[07:22.900 --> 07:28.640]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.520]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[07:33.520 --> 07:39.960]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit InfowarsHealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and

[08:02.900 --> 08:10.260]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[08:10.260 --> 08:17.820]  the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:17.820 --> 08:36.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 26th day of June 2013. We're going to be live
[08:36.540 --> 08:43.080]  here for the next three hours. We have a top technology professor joining us who has been
[08:43.080 --> 08:49.140]  warning of a technological technocratic singularity takeover. This is kind of the different view
[08:49.140 --> 08:54.100]  than Ray Kurzweil that says, all is rosy, all is glowing. He'll be with us for part
[08:54.100 --> 09:01.060]  of the next hour. And then we're going to, that's Roman Yampolinsky.
[09:01.060 --> 09:06.060]  And then we've got James Lane and Richard Grove with the new film, State of Mind, dealing
[09:06.060 --> 09:16.100]  with the real secrets of the global mind control program in studio coming up today. Now, before
[09:16.100 --> 09:21.300]  I go any further here, I want to open the phones up to take your calls. Again, first
[09:21.300 --> 09:28.440]  time callers here today give you a chance to join us on air.
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.460]  The toll free number to talk about any issue that you'd like to discuss. I do want to take
[09:33.460 --> 09:36.100]  a lot of calls in the first hour and I never seem to get around to this. I'll take them
[09:36.100 --> 09:41.500]  the last 15 minutes or so, but we're gonna open the phones up starting at the next segment.
[09:41.500 --> 09:48.780]  And the number to join us is 800-259-9231. I love the wildcard grab bag of the callers.
[09:48.780 --> 09:52.940]  Every time I listen to a rebroadcast, it's the calls that I find most interesting. Now,
[09:52.940 --> 09:57.980]  we don't screen them, so sometimes we get prank calls and sometimes we get people that
[09:57.980 --> 09:59.260]  are drunk.
[09:59.260 --> 10:03.580]  But that's interesting as well. I like to not have that filter. The only time we screen
[10:03.580 --> 10:10.420]  the calls is if I say specifically, I wanna get police officers on about their view of
[10:10.420 --> 10:15.400]  something or I wanna get doctors on about Obamacare. Or if I wanna let nurses call in
[10:15.400 --> 10:20.140]  and talk about how they're euthanizing people all over the US and you hear the nurses call
[10:20.140 --> 10:23.500]  in saying, yeah, we're euthanizing a lady on the third floor right now.
[10:23.500 --> 10:27.140]  She's begging for food and water. She's ten days in. And you'll hear in the background
[10:27.140 --> 10:32.860]  Dr. Walker, Dr. Walker, I mean, they're there, things like that. But it's just a wide open
[10:32.860 --> 10:36.700]  free for all, whatever your question, whatever your comment. If you disagree with me, if
[10:36.700 --> 10:39.300]  you agree with me, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[10:39.300 --> 10:52.300]  We have a lot of good news out there. 97% opposed to TSA naked body scanners. TSA completes
[10:52.300 --> 11:00.940]  enforced public comment period on rollout of invasive technology and 97% on the public
[11:00.940 --> 11:07.500]  notice rulemaking federal site. People have to give their info and everything. 97% are
[11:07.500 --> 11:15.540]  against it. I mean, I talk to people and over 80% that I talk to say Snowden's a hero.
[11:15.540 --> 11:21.540]  And then you see polls saying half of Americans think Snowden's a traitor. You see another
[11:21.540 --> 11:28.540]  poll saying 79% say he's a hero. And then you learn who these polling groups are. The
[11:28.540 --> 11:33.420]  more accurate ones, you see disinfo pieces out there about them saying they're not accurate.
[11:33.420 --> 11:38.900]  And they'll use a few cases where their poll doesn't come true in an election, like Zogby.
[11:38.900 --> 11:44.500]  I found Zogby is more accurate, Gallup's a little more accurate, even though it can be
[11:44.500 --> 11:49.380]  spun sometimes. If you have public policy polling that's run by the Democrats basically,
[11:49.380 --> 11:55.860]  I mean, what a joke. What a joke. We called up to pay to have them to do a poll just to
[11:55.860 --> 11:57.140]  see if we can get them to do it.
[11:57.140 --> 12:01.860]  And they told us, they said, we do not like your politics. We're not gonna let you pay
[12:01.860 --> 12:10.340]  us $5,000 to do a poll. This is just amazing. So my point is, is that when you see an article
[12:10.340 --> 12:17.380]  out there like on infowars.com yesterday, saying majority of Americans support drones
[12:17.380 --> 12:21.020]  domestically and Paul Watson reports on the poll.
[12:21.020 --> 12:24.860]  I've called Paul up, who I think is great, but I'm just having a public discussion about
[12:24.860 --> 12:33.460]  this open air. And I said, Paul, I don't really believe that, I think it was 69% in one part
[12:33.460 --> 12:38.060]  of the poll agreed for anti-terrorism for drone and 60 something percent, there he's
[12:38.060 --> 12:39.060]  pulled it up.
[12:39.060 --> 12:43.660]  Yeah, it's 67%, I'm going from memory, there it is, of them support the use of unmanned
[12:43.660 --> 12:50.540]  spy drones for Homeland Security missions and 63% support their use for fighting crime.
[12:50.540 --> 12:54.660]  But as Rand Paul has said, it's pre-crime, they're flying around surveilling you plus
[12:54.660 --> 13:00.020]  the balance of power is way out of whack when the government's this big.
[13:00.020 --> 13:07.180]  But the issue that I'm basically trying to get at here is that you can't believe all
[13:07.180 --> 13:12.900]  these polls. What you can believe is hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition
[13:12.900 --> 13:18.820]  to deport Piers Morgan. That shows people don't like him and his red coat, usurping
[13:18.820 --> 13:20.520]  anti-gun activities.
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.100]  What you can believe is hundreds of thousands on the White House website saying, we want
[13:24.100 --> 13:32.700]  you to pardon Edward Snowden, Obama. Or hundreds of thousands on the White House website, it's
[13:32.700 --> 13:39.300]  growing towards that saying they want an investigation of the death of Michael Hastings, the reporter
[13:39.300 --> 13:44.500]  that said he had the biggest story of his life and then hours later, his car blew up.
[13:44.500 --> 13:51.180]  That's just some of the issues. But there's the article on infoawars.com, 97% opposed
[13:51.180 --> 13:58.420]  to TSA body scanners in the public comment period. So that is more reflective of what
[13:58.420 --> 13:59.420]  I've seen.
[13:59.420 --> 14:05.100]  I've talked to people at airports and most of them, I'd say 80, 90% are against the naked
[14:05.100 --> 14:10.000]  body scanners and know it's all security theater and dog training and slave training. I have
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.820]  a friend who works at a high level at the Austin Bergstrom Airport. I won't say his
[14:16.820 --> 14:21.420]  name, he asked me not to and he told me, I don't know, five, six years ago about how
[14:21.420 --> 14:22.420]  I was with him.
[14:22.420 --> 14:27.820]  And he said, here, let's turn on the television. Let's watch News Aid Austin, a local Time
[14:27.820 --> 14:32.940]  Warner 24 hour news channel. And he said, let's see what they do. And by the way, News
[14:32.940 --> 14:36.580]  Aid's better in some cases than other mainstream media. They actually have some good people
[14:36.580 --> 14:37.580]  over there.
[14:37.580 --> 14:40.380]  I'm not throwing them under the bus if they're listening, but this happened. And he said
[14:40.380 --> 14:47.180]  they talked to 40 plus people trying to get them to support the pat downs and all the
[14:47.180 --> 14:53.340]  stuff that was going in then. And they found one old lady who said she thought it was great
[14:53.340 --> 14:58.940]  after 40 people, cuz in his job, he had to be there watching this.
[14:58.940 --> 15:08.400]  And so he turned it on, we're watching it. And we're there drinking beer, this was entertainment.
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.800]  And it comes on and he goes, watch, it's gonna be her. And he had the old lady. It was the
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.780]  one person that was for it and he was rolling around with sick laughter.
[15:18.780 --> 15:24.260]  It's very painful actually to see the distortion that goes on. So you've gotta be in the media
[15:24.260 --> 15:28.800]  or around the media to learn how these things work, but that's a great example of that.
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.620]  So there, I've gone over that issue as just an example. Something I've been wanting to
[15:34.620 --> 15:40.380]  air for days as I came back across it this weekend was the so-called Kuwaiti girl that
[15:40.380 --> 15:47.180]  it turned out was really the daughter of the ambassador of the Kuwaiti ambassador.
[15:47.180 --> 15:52.480]  And she famously got up and said they threw the babies out on the floor. They stomped
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.900]  their brains out, all this kind of stuff. And they said for her security, we're not
[15:56.900 --> 16:05.660]  gonna say her name, we're going to use a alias. And you can tell the whole body language of
[16:05.660 --> 16:09.900]  the committee hearing it was totally fake.
[16:09.900 --> 16:17.540]  And it indeed came out that it was a fake testimony and nobody threw babies out of incubators.
[16:17.540 --> 16:22.060]  And there were major journalistic investigations and I've got those articles dealing with it.
[16:22.060 --> 16:27.880]  But when you watch it, then you realize that they had fake newscast from Atlanta saying
[16:27.880 --> 16:34.820]  they were in Kuwait and Israel with blue screens behind them and palm trees saying they were
[16:34.820 --> 16:39.800]  on the roof as chemical weapons, scud missiles were coming in.
[16:39.800 --> 16:45.000]  But back then the public was so mindless and so trusting that they would even send this
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.700]  over an unscrambled satellite feed where people that had 10 foot type dishes and bigger could
[16:51.700 --> 16:56.380]  pick it up. And people recorded it as they would go, okay, get ready to act, all right.
[16:56.380 --> 17:01.980]  And they'd make dirty jokes and stuff and then put their helmets on and then take takes.
[17:01.980 --> 17:06.100]  This wasn't live, they crack up laughing and they'd go, do it again, do it again. We're
[17:06.100 --> 17:14.080]  here in Tel Aviv or we're here in Kuwait in different days, same reporters, same set.
[17:14.080 --> 17:21.060]  And I remember watching that in 1990, 1991, fake newscast. Folks, if you think it's bad
[17:21.060 --> 17:29.660]  then, it's much worse now. And that's my point is that we're not living in Kansas anymore.
[17:29.660 --> 17:34.340]  But what's happening is there's two different worlds happening. You've got old media that's
[17:34.340 --> 17:41.900]  real, like talk radio to some extent. You've got some print publications that want readers,
[17:41.900 --> 17:47.020]  so sometimes they tell the truth, like Rolling Stone.
[17:47.020 --> 17:53.300]  You've got new media all over the place and together we're really bigger than the establishment
[17:53.300 --> 17:58.940]  dinosaur media. And so the globalists are operating in a vacuum. They're up there acting
[17:58.940 --> 18:02.780]  like everybody's buying another propaganda, acting like they still have all the viewers.
[18:02.780 --> 18:07.500]  All they have is the biggest sets that cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year to
[18:07.500 --> 18:12.960]  run. TV's very expensive and they're losing money, all of them.
[18:12.960 --> 18:16.340]  Even News Corps that has more viewers and all the other cable news together has been
[18:16.340 --> 18:22.260]  losing money on record. It's news division because it's a propaganda division. General
[18:22.260 --> 18:28.340]  Electric and Microsoft that have been connected to NBC and MSNBC for a long time, NBC for
[18:28.340 --> 18:31.380]  50 years to General Electric.
[18:31.380 --> 18:37.100]  They're going to make money off their weapons division where they've got $5 million cruise
[18:37.100 --> 18:42.240]  missiles and million dollar cluster bombs and bunker busters that are being dropped
[18:42.240 --> 18:48.420]  on people. So what if their news division loses 50, $100 million a year? $200 million
[18:48.420 --> 18:53.980]  a year sometimes. It doesn't matter, that's the cost of brainwashing people. But you see,
[18:53.980 --> 18:56.020]  they don't even have the audience anymore.
[18:56.020 --> 19:03.060]  But all they've got is the illusion of the prestige of being on these stupid shows. And
[19:03.060 --> 19:06.940]  yes, if you're on one of these shows and then you do something interesting, then it will
[19:06.940 --> 19:12.860]  be put on all of the mainstream shows. And then you've got a big audience, because then
[19:12.860 --> 19:15.020]  you're on Jay Leno.
[19:15.020 --> 19:20.660]  Then you're on the other shows that do have large audiences compared to news, and then
[19:20.660 --> 19:26.640]  it gets a ton of attention. So I just wanna continue to announce to everybody that the
[19:26.640 --> 19:34.620]  establishment is flailing around. And so they're trying a tyrannical takeover, but it's not
[19:34.620 --> 19:39.420]  in a vacuum. There's resistance to it. It's like they're coming in for a landing like
[19:39.420 --> 19:41.980]  there's no resistance and we're here waiting for them.
[19:41.980 --> 19:47.460]  Now I'm gonna go to your calls cuz I promise to do it. And then the big news on infowars.com,
[19:47.460 --> 19:54.900]  hiding in plain view. Michael Hastings' wife has said, quote, he's gonna take down whoever
[19:54.900 --> 20:00.660]  did this. And they basically, her and her friends and his friends believe he was killed.

[24:29.840 --> 24:38.980]  wife vows to take down whoever did this. That's the quote from the info wars.com article by
[24:38.980 --> 24:46.260]  Paul Joseph Watson, friend of journalists reveals colleagues were too scared to release
[24:46.260 --> 24:49.640]  panicked email.
[24:49.640 --> 24:52.600]  And then everybody's supposed to just line up and go along with this. I want to talk
[24:52.600 --> 24:59.000]  directly to his friends, the sergeant that had the courage to go public Sergeant Biggs,
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  Joe Biggs. He said everybody's scared, but I'm not scared. He said Hastings, he said
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  Mike would stand up for me if this happened. And Fox News is Megyn Kelly made jokes about
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.100]  tinfoil hats. It's just despicable, ladies and gentlemen, that we've got a war on the
[25:17.100 --> 25:18.840]  press in this country.
[25:18.840 --> 25:25.400]  He says, they're coming after me in a tweet 15 hours before sends an email out two hours
[25:25.400 --> 25:31.720]  before his car blows up. And then we're immediately not supposed to ask if he was killed right
[25:31.720 --> 25:35.320]  there tells you what's going on. I'm gonna be breaking that down and playing some clips
[25:35.320 --> 25:38.760]  of that and getting into some other world news, obviously, but right now let's go to
[25:38.760 --> 25:43.180]  Will in Georgia. Will, you're on the air. Welcome.
[25:43.180 --> 25:48.240]  Thank you, Alex. Thank God for you and for import wars. It's a powerful ministry and
[25:48.240 --> 25:52.520]  it's an opportunity to take our country back to restore our credo civil religion. Our ancestors
[25:52.520 --> 25:57.800]  received American covenant from the creator of the universe and nobody in between. This
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.240]  is the promised land that Isaiah prophesied and the forces that are marshaled against
[26:02.240 --> 26:08.000]  us are those that Thomas Jefferson whose writings and life proved him to be a prophet of God
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.120]  is Zion. We are the new Israeli. Anybody can read Isaiah. It's quite clear that England's
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.360]  chief Rabbi Johnson Sachs agrees all the sides of stipulations are met in America and Michael
[26:19.360 --> 26:26.160]  Hastings within five minutes passing the red light at whatever that everybody can go look
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.160]  it up.
[26:27.160 --> 26:33.020]  But red light camera Hastings that can see the picture that the paparazzi took in about
[26:33.020 --> 26:38.800]  four minutes, I think in 34 seconds from passing that light several blocks away. His car was
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.200]  blown up and the fellow with his seats and the keep on was out there with a with a garden
[26:44.200 --> 26:50.260]  hose already sprung from his street. Imagine how long it would take. So it was some minutes
[26:50.260 --> 26:54.720]  before the car blew up after it went through the intersection and by the time the light
[26:54.720 --> 26:58.720]  gets down there by the time the camera gets down to the bombing the gentleman with the
[26:58.720 --> 27:05.320]  seats and the and the keep on already has the yard hose in front of his house strung
[27:05.320 --> 27:10.560]  out watering a car fire. He had a beard white hair. We know how old he was. Everybody knows
[27:10.560 --> 27:14.220]  you don't put water on a car fire. If you want to put it out you do that in order to
[27:14.220 --> 27:19.040]  exacerbate it. That's why the flames were going higher and higher as he put the water
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.720]  on it. So just think of the timing under five minutes. He had already strung the water hose
[27:23.720 --> 27:29.640]  out from his house had it turn had gone back to the spigot turned it on was putting water
[27:29.640 --> 27:36.280]  on car fire. And it was a bombing. We know it was Boston breaks. We know he was going
[27:36.280 --> 27:40.680]  maybe 45 miles an hour through the intersection. Evidently the people behind and running in
[27:40.680 --> 27:45.200]  one remote control didn't have the wherewithal or at that time in the morning didn't figure
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.360]  they needed to stop at the light. So they just ran the light that completely an assassination
[27:50.360 --> 27:56.000]  this crucifixion 2.0 the same people hammered the impalement stakes into tens of thousands
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  of Christ's for twice denying Caesar was God Almighty. You can read Thomas Jefferson's
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  letter to his nephew.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.240]  No, I hear you. I hear you. Look, all I know is there should be an investigation of this
[28:04.240 --> 28:09.320]  and you can't trust the police to do it. I mean, the coroner of Breitbart that did the
[28:09.320 --> 28:16.720]  autopsy died of poisoning. And they're like, Oh, well, maybe that's normal. It's just amazing
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.920]  what's going on. I appreciate you calling in. I mean, they're killing a lot of people,
[28:20.920 --> 28:24.860]  Aaron Swartz, you name it. The list goes on and on. Pat Tillman, they got caught lying
[28:24.860 --> 28:25.860]  about that.
[28:25.860 --> 28:30.440]  They killed five people out of private Lynch's unit who went public saying it was all a PR
[28:30.440 --> 28:35.000]  stunt. They murdered him. They had assassins popping up, you know, shooting them in their
[28:35.000 --> 28:42.200]  backyard and stuff. It's just absolutely incredible. Let's go to TJ in Alabama. TJ, go ahead.
[28:42.200 --> 28:48.280]  Hey Alex, how are you? Pretty good, sir. Hey, listen, uh, Jesus Christ is Lord and savior
[28:48.280 --> 28:54.960]  and we're all info warriors in this together. Alex, I'm a two year listener now and a one
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.000]  to call in about the capabilities of that Mercedes car. I hear a lot of people call
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.600]  in talking about, you know, uh, get Mercedes to step up and do this. Uh, I bet you haven't
[29:04.600 --> 29:08.960]  heard anything from them. Have you? No, we haven't heard anything from Mercedes. Well,
[29:08.960 --> 29:18.600]  let me tell you, my mother was killed in a Mercedes Biz, a SLK 1999 SLK little two seater.
[29:18.600 --> 29:24.560]  And so my fan, uh, airbag did not come out properly. So my family, we sued a Mercedes
[29:24.560 --> 29:31.920]  Biz for wrongful death. And let me tell you something, Alex, that in 1999 that car did
[29:31.920 --> 29:38.920]  not have OnStar in it. Okay. It didn't have any type of a cellular phone hookup in that
[29:38.920 --> 29:46.560]  automobile. But when it, uh, when that airbag module, I want to hear this. When we come
[29:46.560 --> 29:51.980]  back, I'm going to hear the rest of your story. Stay with us. We're on the March, the empire's
[29:51.980 --> 30:02.600]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Are we choosing our own destiny or has it

[33:24.880 --> 33:51.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us here today. We
[33:51.720 --> 34:02.440]  were just talking to a gentleman in Alabama about what specifically happened to his mother
[34:02.440 --> 34:07.320]  and what happened when he was dealing with Mercedes in, I think he said 1999. He said
[34:07.320 --> 34:12.640]  there was an OnStar, was it supposedly a cell phone that they used in these wireless navigation
[34:12.640 --> 34:17.320]  systems that we know on record are being used to track everything you do and now remote
[34:17.320 --> 34:23.560]  control the car. That's the DARPA project director on record and a car and driver and
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.640]  the former National Security Advisor, Richard Clark as well, just for people before Rachel
[34:28.640 --> 34:33.680]  Maddow comes out and says that I'm lying and saying that they can remote control cars.
[34:33.680 --> 34:37.400]  That's a fact, but she knows her audience is so stupid. She'll probably, I'm just giving
[34:37.400 --> 34:41.720]  her a good example of kind of how she likes to lie, probably a good lie for her. She can
[34:41.720 --> 34:47.000]  say that I said giant wasps are underneath the Capitol building. I never said that, but
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.480]  she said I said that. This is the type of deception they engage in. But specifically,
[34:51.480 --> 34:58.600]  sir, getting back to you, go ahead and tell us specifically what you were about to finish
[34:58.600 --> 34:59.600]  up with.
[34:59.600 --> 35:07.320]  Okay, Alex, like I said, the Mercedes-Benz was a brand new SLK 1999 model. And my mother
[35:07.320 --> 35:14.760]  was killed in a head-on collision at a very, very low delta V change in velocity. But the
[35:14.760 --> 35:23.200]  kicker here is that the airbag didn't deploy fully. It kind of clover-leafed. So within
[35:23.200 --> 35:31.520]  15 hours of that automobile accident, there were engineers from Stuttgart, Germany on
[35:31.520 --> 35:40.080]  the ground covertly that got into where the car was being stored and downloaded from the
[35:40.080 --> 35:48.080]  car's computer every bit of data from that car. Now that was in 1999, so somehow that
[35:48.080 --> 35:55.040]  car had a mechanism in it that communicated to Stuttgart, Germany that the airbag module
[35:55.040 --> 36:03.880]  had fired. And so just think of the progress that's been made since that time to now.
[36:03.880 --> 36:10.880]  Like I said, there was no on-star, there was no visible way of communicating that we the
[36:10.880 --> 36:15.800]  consumer knew of that was in that vehicle. But there were engineers on the ground that
[36:15.800 --> 36:24.880]  bribed the storage place to get into and plugged up some type of mechanism to the car to extract
[36:24.880 --> 36:31.840]  the data. That's how defensive they are. And get this, in the trial, it was a 14-day
[36:31.840 --> 36:40.360]  jury trial. The father of the airbag flew in on a Gulfstream V from Germany. He invented
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.480]  the airbag, and guess who he was working for when he invented it? He was working for Mercedes
[36:46.480 --> 36:52.240]  Benz. His name is Dr. Luigi Bambella, and he said he had never seen an airbag module
[36:52.240 --> 36:59.720]  do that in all of his life and his work. He's a consultant now for them. But we also subpoenaed,
[36:59.720 --> 37:02.200]  as a company, can I say the name of it, Alex?
[37:02.200 --> 37:03.760]  Yeah, go ahead, sir.
[37:03.760 --> 37:10.560]  I believe it's Bosch. And this Bosch company has the algorithm for the ignition switch
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.880]  for the airbag. And they were subpoenaed to give us that algorithm, and they denied it.
[37:16.880 --> 37:23.840]  They would not give the algorithm. So that's my point there as far as that goes on. Mercedes
[37:23.840 --> 37:30.920]  had about 15 strings of lawyers and 25 paralegals, a whole building rented. I keep hearing a
[37:30.920 --> 37:34.960]  lot of the audience say, well, let Mercedes step up, let them step up. I don't believe
[37:34.960 --> 37:38.960]  you'll see them step up. They're part of the military industrial complex.
[37:38.960 --> 37:47.400]  Sure, well, I appreciate your call, sir. Sorry about what happened to your mother. Look,
[37:47.400 --> 37:53.760]  the larger issue here is we always lose the forest for the trees, or the trees for the
[37:53.760 --> 38:00.840]  forest. Everything is having remote control kill switches put in it. Everything is having
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.840]  surveillance systems put in it. And you pay for the extra cost of all the electronics
[38:06.840 --> 38:10.160]  goods due to this global standardization.
[38:10.160 --> 38:15.720]  I don't care if you're in Germany or Australia or Russia or China or Canada or Mexico or
[38:15.720 --> 38:23.360]  Chile or Venezuela for that matter. Everything manufactured by these Fortune 100 companies
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.740]  is globally agreed upon even outside of law to have these tracker systems. Those articles
[38:28.740 --> 38:41.960]  earlier this year about the communist Chinese can track and monitor and cut off electronics
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.440]  in the US and including a lot of electronic chips and components in weapons systems.
[38:47.440 --> 38:53.520]  Well, of course, that's because all of this stuff has to have back doors. So the NSA,
[38:53.520 --> 39:00.080]  which isn't for the US government, we pay for it, but it's run by foreign banks. Over
[39:00.080 --> 39:05.960]  100 major companies, private contractors, are the ones that get the contracts to run
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.520]  all this and to do the analyst work and do the spying.
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.400]  Private corporations have come and lobbied to build a giant government and then have
[39:14.400 --> 39:23.320]  the keys given to them and then they're paid to rape us financially and intellectually
[39:23.320 --> 39:30.960]  and our privacy. And so they've so overshot us in the over the topness of the tyranny
[39:30.960 --> 39:38.480]  that I get up here 15 years ago, seven years ago, a year ago and say all the new video
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.800]  game consoles that are high end, all the new cars that are high end, all the new houses
[39:43.800 --> 39:47.320]  that are high end are total surveillance.
[39:47.320 --> 39:53.800]  I mean, I saw a billion dollar contracts for regions that we covered two years ago. No
[39:53.800 --> 39:59.880]  one else covered it, but infowars.com and Drudge picked it up. Drudgereport.com, no
[39:59.880 --> 40:05.300]  one else covered it. The company's bragging they'd gotten contracts to put microphones
[40:05.300 --> 40:11.240]  and hidden cameras in streetlights and fake power transformers and other systems with
[40:11.240 --> 40:16.240]  shotgun mics to listen to everybody.
[40:16.240 --> 40:26.480]  And by the way, even before that came out, it was in the news in 1999 in the Austin American
[40:26.480 --> 40:32.000]  Statesman and I have shots of it in the Statesman saying, we got a federal grant for gunshot
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.240]  detectors. $800,000 a year over the next decade, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the senator brag that
[40:41.240 --> 40:44.120]  she got gunshot detectors for Austin.
[40:44.120 --> 40:47.920]  Notice you've never heard one person arrested from a gunshot detector. You notice you've
[40:47.920 --> 40:51.240]  never heard about it. They've been put in nationwide now. Austin was one of the pilot
[40:51.240 --> 40:57.360]  cities in the late 90s. I looked at the company name and went and search engined it and it
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.320]  was on their site where they were playing promo audio. They had promo audio bragging
[41:02.320 --> 41:07.380]  that they were really shotgun mics and said, here you hear people talking on the park bench
[41:07.380 --> 41:09.640]  from 200 yards away.
[41:09.640 --> 41:15.440]  And it's a real recording with birds tweeting and people talking. And of course it was phrased
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.920]  like they were criminals. Just like the new Homeland Security training videos, in all
[41:19.920 --> 41:26.920]  of them, the drones are watching gun owners shoot guns on their ranch or sell guns to
[41:26.920 --> 41:35.300]  each other. And it's always white guys with John Deere hats. That's what this is for.
[41:35.300 --> 41:40.600]  It's always been, of course there's drones. Now the government admits it domestically.
[41:40.600 --> 41:44.920]  Of course there's Google blimps. I told you a decade ago Google was gonna roll out with
[41:44.920 --> 41:50.800]  blimps, really NSA blimps, and call it Internet service when it's really surveillance platforms
[41:50.800 --> 41:57.680]  looking through your walls with ground penetrating radar.
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.000]  Black and white images, that's 30 year old technology that was declassified. They've
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.560]  got wireless Internet, basically what it is, beams, where it's color, folks. And by color,
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.720]  they can see every freckle on your body, every goose bump. It's better vision than human
[42:13.720 --> 42:21.580]  vision. And they just fly over your house, scanning everything you're doing.
[42:21.580 --> 42:29.320]  And it's all on record is the issue. Do you understand this? And you paid for it. They
[42:29.320 --> 42:34.280]  get rich. Google is the biggest corporation in the world. You can debate whether it's
[42:34.280 --> 42:40.040]  Google, Apple, or Exxon Mobil. The point is, they're the triumphant, the trifecta up there.
[42:40.040 --> 42:46.760]  And they all sit up there squatting on top of us, and it's all a giant joke to them.
[42:46.760 --> 42:52.220]  But the top Google guys, one's worth 20 billion, one's worth 40 billion, one's worth 30 billion,
[42:52.220 --> 42:58.000]  one's worth 10 billion, 8 billion. They're all just up there sucking your money, sucking
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.920]  everything, laughing at you.
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.000]  But it's okay cuz Vince Vaughn has a movie coming out where Google's really sweet and
[43:04.000 --> 43:13.840]  funny and nerdly, and they're your future. This is all the big sick joke for these people.
[43:13.840 --> 43:19.960]  I'm gonna go back to your calls. First, I wanna tell you, the new magazine is in. It's
[43:19.960 --> 43:31.000]  the new July issue. And it's you are the target of government spying, big, glossy, color magazine,
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.320]  60 color glossy pages.
[43:34.320 --> 43:39.040]  It's got a quarter of the month, the total influence, economic, political, even spiritual
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.720]  is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We
[43:43.720 --> 43:49.240]  must be alerted to the danger that the public policy could itself become the captive of
[43:49.240 --> 43:52.120]  a scientific technological elite.
[43:52.120 --> 43:57.480]  And then he goes into the military industrial complex, January 17th, 1961, three days before
[43:57.480 --> 44:03.760]  he stepped down as president to John F Kennedy. That's the kind of stuff in this magazine
[44:03.760 --> 44:11.080]  just totally and completely jam packed with key intel. Letters to the editor, incredible
[44:11.080 --> 44:17.720]  art, NSA spying, intimidation and censorship, what it's really all about.
[44:17.720 --> 44:23.520]  New polls show Americans oppose NSA spying, just amazing graphics with a great job. The
[44:23.520 --> 44:31.120]  great team does. It's got gardening tips, and then it's got ten Infowars free bumper
[44:31.120 --> 44:38.920]  stickers. Ten, ten in every magazine. Now I couldn't afford to put these in the magazines
[44:38.920 --> 44:42.480]  we put on the streets in Austin and San Antonio.
[44:42.480 --> 44:50.520]  So the ten bumper stickers, five little ones, one, two, three, four, five, six little ones.
[44:50.520 --> 44:59.080]  And then we've got, over here when you get to it, four big ones. America has been occupied
[44:59.080 --> 45:06.360]  by globalist forces, infowars.com. Listen to Alex Jones show at infowars.com. Infowars.com,
[45:06.360 --> 45:11.680]  forbidden information. Listen to Alex Jones at infowars.com.
[45:11.680 --> 45:16.840]  We only had the money to put these in 50,000 of the 120,000 magazines we printed. So the
[45:16.840 --> 45:25.080]  50,000 we have to sell and to send out to subscribers have about 40 cents per magazine
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.000]  of added cost. That's more than a cost of print each magazine of these high quality,
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.940]  the petroleum based black and white bumper stickers that last for years.
[45:33.940 --> 45:38.120]  This is a weapon system. And you wanna wake people up for all the subscribers, anybody
[45:38.120 --> 45:43.160]  that buys them in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost, or if you wanna just buy a
[45:43.160 --> 45:50.040]  10 pack. We're selling these at cost to get the word out and it is just an excellent magazine,
[45:50.040 --> 45:52.600]  great to wake up friends and family.
[45:52.600 --> 46:03.600]  It gets into what happened at Bilderberg. It gets into 2013, the year Bilderberg collapsed.
[46:03.600 --> 46:07.960]  It is all in there and I'm really proud of the job the crew did. Attention, patriotic
[46:07.960 --> 46:14.920]  Americans and freedom lovers everywhere. We are putting these 10 bumper stickers, that's
[46:14.920 --> 46:23.200]  500,000 total, in these 50,000 magazines so that you can post them in legal and lawful
[46:23.200 --> 46:25.240]  areas to get the word out.
[46:25.240 --> 46:28.320]  And this is having a big effect around the country. This is your mission, should you
[46:28.320 --> 46:34.240]  choose to accept it. And also take photos of where you post them in legal and lawful
[46:34.240 --> 46:38.720]  areas in your own property and things like that. And then send them to us, and we have
[46:38.720 --> 46:48.480]  the email in there. So letters at infowars.com so that you can see it in the next issue of
[46:48.480 --> 46:50.680]  the magazine.
[46:50.680 --> 46:56.960]  We break down who's at Bilderberg, including Petraeus, and so much more. So there you go,
[46:56.960 --> 47:03.200]  that is a labor of love. Infowars July issue, July 4th, launching a major info weapon at

[47:48.620 --> 47:53.160]  and the good Lord above. Let's go to Dan, no, that's right, I already talked to the
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.400]  Mercedes guy. Let's talk to Dan in Oregon. Dan, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[47:57.400 --> 48:02.240]  Hey, how you doing? God bless you and all you do. A lot of fans out here in Oregon of
[48:02.240 --> 48:03.240]  yours.
[48:03.240 --> 48:04.240]  Thank you, sir.
[48:04.240 --> 48:07.920]  Hey, yeah, when you said there's a lot of resistance, of course, we're not all gonna
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.160]  lay down and run under our bed and let these people stomp us and take our properties and
[48:12.160 --> 48:17.480]  destroy things. Who knows what's gonna happen if the banks ever collapse everything? I don't
[48:17.480 --> 48:20.280]  know how much control we'd have over that.
[48:20.280 --> 48:24.640]  They're incrementally collapsing things and they're putting in soft martial law to prepare
[48:24.640 --> 48:29.440]  us. That's what all of this is about. They put chemical weapons in the water on record.
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.920]  We are under a foreign banking attack. It controls the bureaucracy and the health departments.
[48:34.920 --> 48:39.800]  The health departments are really the military arm to carry out the CPS grabbing, the force
[48:39.800 --> 48:42.120]  drugging, the poisoning of the water.
[48:42.120 --> 48:46.120]  They were set up by the eugenicist in 1910 in New York.
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.600]  Wow. Yeah. You know what? And even in Oregon, like you say, with the health, people are
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.160]  having so many breathing problems here because they're really spraying heavy in the skies
[48:56.160 --> 48:57.160]  anymore.
[48:57.160 --> 48:58.160]  Of course they are.
[48:58.160 --> 49:02.560]  And I can't believe that people don't look up and notice what's wrong with the sky. You
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.240]  know, they don't notice things. But it's like, it's everything going on. People are more
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.280]  worried about things. I don't even see how people can watch MSNBC and think they're getting
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.260]  news. I watched it yesterday to see what they were gonna talk about with what the Supreme
[49:15.260 --> 49:17.000]  Court did with the voter I.D. thing.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.680]  You're saying, of course, it's all racist. Everything's racist anymore. It's so disgusting.
[49:22.680 --> 49:26.880]  It's not 1850 and they treat it like, oh, you slaves. That's all in the past.
[49:26.880 --> 49:31.760]  Well, what's happening is they've already got electronic voting fraud in in most areas.
[49:31.760 --> 49:40.560]  So the real issue here is, is that there is gerrymandering by whoever's already in power
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.600]  going on. And the Democrats and Republicans told the Supreme Court to do this because
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.840]  they want to be able to keep their little mafia fiefdoms shut up.
[49:49.840 --> 49:53.200]  So that's what this is really all about, because the only thing that can get around the electronic
[49:53.200 --> 50:01.420]  voting fraud is the gerrymandering. So you may own the fraud company that's controlling
[50:01.420 --> 50:06.600]  how people vote, but doesn't matter. The Democrats or Republicans, whoever's in power, they'll
[50:06.600 --> 50:13.240]  control the gerrymandering where, again, they can't have election fraud if it's too obvious
[50:13.240 --> 50:17.680]  that you're a Democratic district or a Republican district, but it's going to the other group.
[50:17.680 --> 50:21.160]  So it's all just a bunch of mafias. The only thing holding them back is the separation
[50:21.160 --> 50:25.880]  of powers. That's why the globalists want a centralization and always demonize gridlock.
[50:25.880 --> 50:30.320]  Because if they ever get a total centralization, then there won't be all the infighting by
[50:30.320 --> 50:33.320]  the criminal groups that actually holds them back.
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.480]  The only thing, the reason the Nazis were so bad is that they got a bureaucracy together
[50:37.480 --> 50:42.980]  that was in total control. And it took the Soviets really 20 years to really get fully
[50:42.980 --> 50:48.760]  taken over before they could really start killing everybody in mass. That's why David
[50:48.760 --> 50:54.060]  Rockefeller really worshiped Mao, because he immediately was able to kill tens of millions.
[50:54.060 --> 50:57.620]  And they like that. They like to go directly to mass murder, but they have to get you ready
[50:57.620 --> 51:01.560]  for that first. We'll be right back.
[51:01.560 --> 51:06.360]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[51:06.360 --> 51:12.040]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[51:12.040 --> 51:17.640]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[51:17.640 --> 51:21.960]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really
[51:21.960 --> 51:27.080]  be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll

[54:09.040 --> 54:13.120]  off the next hour, I'm going to get into the bombshell news and these audio clips and video
[54:13.120 --> 54:22.000]  clips of Michael Hastings, one of his best friends, this Sergeant Joe Biggs, one of the
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.760]  people he blind copied the email that was panicked. And the fact that the family basically
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.960]  says they think he was killed. And the wife has said, quote, Molly, this is not getting
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.280]  media attention. This is hiding in plain view. This has been out since yesterday that she
[54:37.280 --> 54:42.160]  said, quote, she's gonna take down whoever did this.
[54:42.160 --> 54:45.840]  Well, you better come out and say you think it was foul play clearly, or you might fall
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.100]  down and hit your head. Or your car will blow up and they say they hit a tree. And again,
[54:51.100 --> 54:55.180]  this is how the law of the jungle works once you're in a tyranny. People just start rolling
[54:55.180 --> 55:01.180]  over in fear. And once that happens, the tyrants win and then the worst of the worst becomes
[55:01.180 --> 55:02.180]  the norm.
[55:02.180 --> 55:07.920]  This is how freedom dies, folks, is when everybody just gets scared, everybody complies, everybody
[55:07.920 --> 55:13.760]  just says, no, Aaron Swartz must have hung himself. Even though he said he was gonna
[55:13.760 --> 55:19.840]  fight the feds and even though he was worth tens of millions of dollars and just gotten
[55:19.840 --> 55:23.520]  engaged and said he was gonna fight the fake federal charges.
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.640]  I mean, now the FBI just comes to your house, shoots you in the top of the head, and then
[55:27.640 --> 55:31.000]  they go up, we shot him in the head. He didn't have any weapons, didn't attack us, he's dead.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.640]  They're like, it's no big deal. Cops all the time, you see it in the news, guy gets out
[55:35.640 --> 55:38.880]  of his car, they tell him get out of his car, guy gets out, nothing in his hands, shoot
[55:38.880 --> 55:39.880]  him dead.
[55:39.880 --> 55:43.240]  They go, well, we felt threatened. Maybe they can just put us in sand pits and shoot us
[55:43.240 --> 55:47.440]  like the Nazis and say, I feel threatened, boom, boom, boom. I mean, we're about one
[55:47.440 --> 55:55.780]  step away from that.
[55:55.780 --> 56:00.140]  Speaking of tyranny, look at this article up on infoawards.com of The Daily Caller.
[56:00.140 --> 56:06.360]  Gag order sought for eighth grader arrested for NRA shirt that simply said protect your
[56:06.360 --> 56:18.500]  rights and had the NRA symbol on it. And it goes on to say that CBS affiliate WOWKTV is
[56:18.500 --> 56:25.940]  in court seeking a gag order to keep him from talking about the case.
[56:25.940 --> 56:30.320]  And to keep his father from speaking out and saying he's having his First Amendment persecuted.
[56:30.320 --> 56:33.760]  Yeah, hey, they're pointing out that we're a bunch of tyrants that we told him take a
[56:33.760 --> 56:37.840]  shirt off. And he said doesn't violate school policy, we're allowed to wear shirts. Just
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.200]  says protect your rights, so they arrested him.
[56:42.200 --> 56:52.320]  I've got an article where a gentleman is facing 13 years in prison in LA for drawing with
[56:52.320 --> 56:59.840]  water-soluble chalk, children's chalk, about people's rights on the street. Yeah, they
[56:59.840 --> 57:05.440]  arrest people in Austin for that now. They will throw the book at you where I live. Because
[57:05.440 --> 57:08.440]  again, the same thing's happening out in LA.
[57:08.440 --> 57:14.720]  We're going into a big fat tyranny, folks. You understand that? California man faces
[57:14.720 --> 57:26.300]  13 years in jail for scribbling anti-bank messages in chalk. You criticize the New World
[57:26.300 --> 57:30.000]  Order, we're gonna arrest you. And look, right there in the article out of RT, it says a
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.320]  judge has barred his attorney from mentioning freedom of speech during trial.
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.580]  Yeah, all over the country, state and federal courts, they say you don't bring, I've read
[57:38.580 --> 57:41.800]  the transcripts, it's in the news all the time, there it is. You don't bring up the
[57:41.800 --> 57:48.440]  Constitution here that the judge has sworn an oath to. These people are flaming tyrants,
[57:48.440 --> 57:49.680]  flaming.
[57:49.680 --> 57:54.400]  And they are scared of your First Amendment, because they know they've done wrong, folks.
[57:54.400 --> 57:57.600]  That's why they're persecuting the press. It's why they're telling pro-life groups you
[57:57.600 --> 58:02.800]  can't be pro-life anymore, we're gonna arrest you. Your speech isn't allowed. I mean, that's
[58:02.800 --> 58:09.200]  in the news. And the press won't even stand up for Hastings, because they're not a press.
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.720]  They're a globalist regurgitation machine. The New World Order vomits lies, they gobble
[58:14.720 --> 58:18.320]  it up and vomit it back on us. Well, you know what? You can keep your stinking vomit, New
[58:18.320 --> 58:19.720]  World Order.
[58:19.720 --> 58:25.300]  As for me and my family, we choose justice, we choose honor, we choose courage, and we
[58:25.300 --> 58:30.480]  are full steam ahead, in through and beyond. Folks, history's happening right now. And
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.000]  you're gonna speak out to the press about your Second Amendment? We don't want that
[58:36.000 --> 58:43.000]  family talking to the press. Gag them!
[58:43.400 --> 58:50.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.400]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:31.680]  All right, I'm going to get into Hastings' wife saying, quote, she vows to take down
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.720]  whoever did this. You know, his car blew up. We're going to be getting to that in the next
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.960]  segment, and we've got a special guest joining us on the technocratic takeover of top professor.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.000]  But right now, let's go back to your calls. William in Utah. William, what's on your mind
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.600]  today? Hey, Alex. Well, I know a lot of people are scared, especially with this Michael Hastings
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:01.200]  thing coming out. It's pretty apparent everyone knows that it's real, you know? People are
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.680]  scared that- They're killing a lot of reporters. They're
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.400]  killing a lot of soldiers. They're killing good guys all over the place. They're going
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.440]  to keep doing it. And anyway, there's two things that I've found
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.000]  in my personal life that's brought me peace and helped me get through these times. The
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.120]  first thing is, you know, daily prayer, talking with our Father in Heaven, the Father of our
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:30.040]  spirits. And the second thing is daily scripture study. I use my iPad every morning to read
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:34.640]  the King James Bible, and I also read the Book of Mormon. I don't know if you've ever-
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.280]  Have you ever read the Book of Mormon? No, I haven't.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.360]  The most powerful chapters are the last four chapters. So it's Moroni, chapter seven through
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.680]  ten. I recommend if you don't read anything else, read those last four chapters. And you
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.080]  know, if we do these two basic things, God will lead us to what we need to do to fight
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:02:00.360]  against tyranny and support freedom. Very interesting. What's your take on courts
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.760]  telling Second Amendment advocates that they can't have their free speech? Gag orders sought
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.360]  for eighth grader arrested over NRA and a man facing 13 years in jail in LA for water
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.720]  soluble chalk with anti-New World Order messages on the sidewalk. The judge says do not bring
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:21.560]  up free speech as a defense so that it can't be mentioned so the government loses the appeal.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.960]  This is judges consciously involved in trying to defraud justice.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:31.880]  Yeah, I think it's ridiculous. I myself, I'm an artist and you know, we all deserve the
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.320]  freedom of speech and expression and- Yeah, well I've meant to do this for a while.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.080]  I'm going out in Austin with chalk today and I'm going to run around all over everything.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.160]  I mean, give me a break. It's totally First Amendment. It washes off the next rain. And
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:50.100]  I think everybody everywhere, in fact, we should have on July 4th in between hot dogs
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:55.560]  and fireworks. I think everybody should go out with chalk under the First Amendment.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.080]  You may be arrested in this tyrant of a country and write anti-New World Order pro-liberty
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.600]  messages. You may be founding father quotes on the sidewalk. But see, if it's little kids
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.600]  out there drawing flowers and out there drawing little houses, they don't arrest them. They
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.880]  don't want you having your speech. They want you to pay your money to them and take some
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.600]  vaccines and roll over and die. And you know what? I told them they'd go right to Hades.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.920]  Thank you, William. Charles in Georgia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.440]  Hello, sir. It's a pleasure to be with you. And I've been a listener for about four years
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:33.280]  now. I'm well awake. And I want to address this issue about the federal court makes gay
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:40.080]  marriage legal. I don't know whether or not you saw that. It came in today where you got
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.600]  all kind of new. Just type in federal court makes gay marriage legal and you'll see a
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.360]  ton of articles where it's on different news networks where they've made gay marriage legal
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:57.760]  and everything. And I just want to say the stuff you preach definitely coincides with
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:05.160]  what the Bible prophecy says. And for that, it's just amazing to know that there's people
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.520]  out there like yourself and other people that you interview and everything that are giving
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.680]  the truth out amongst people, because even though we live in a society where people easily
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.880]  get offended by other people telling the truth on there and the Bible says the truth hurts
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.040]  and you're going to have people that don't get offended. They don't get upset about it,
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.360]  but it has to be preached. I mean, Jesus said in the Bible that, you know, if they, if they'll
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.680]  persecute me, then they'll persecute those that follow me and those that follow my teachers
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680]  and everything.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.220]  As I haven't gotten to the big ruling, you can see drugs report.com has the big rainbow
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:43.280]  flag up there and all the latest on it. We've got some articles on info wars.com. But again,
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.840]  on the service, it sounds like civil rights. That's how it's sold. But in the reality,
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.440]  it's about teaching five-year-olds about sex. It's about the government taking over from
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.320]  parents. It's about anti-family stuff. They do not like marriage. They do not like the
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.560]  family. That's the government.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.320]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.000]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.600]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.920]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:27.080]  be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.560]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:21.360]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:30.520]  All right, we're now into our number two. Coming up, we have a top professor joining
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:36.120]  us dealing with the technological takeover that's happening. From your appliances spying
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.320]  on you to all the new pharmaceuticals that are going to come out. They have their way.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.040]  We're going to have tracker chips in them. That's all mainstream news. Told you that
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.480]  a decade ago. Now it's all mainstream. You might want to listen to us. We know what we're
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.000]  talking about. The Supreme Court strikes down federal law that marriage is between a man
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.480]  and a woman.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.080]  Again, it's about going after marriage. People go, hey, let people live together. Live in
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:04.560]  peace. That's how it is on the surface. But this agenda in the textbooks, in the plans,
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:11.640]  you see how anti-family Hollywood is. You see the agenda. You see how anti-man it is.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:17.520]  This is a social engineering program to break down society on record. On record to tell
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.360]  five-year-olds that Heather has two mommies or that Bobby has two daddies.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:32.600]  I mean, this is pedophile behavior. Forcing down the throat of children, specifically,
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.520]  sexualizing them when they're supposed to be innocent. Jocelyn Elder's saying, let's
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.180]  teach five-year-olds how to masturbate. Reach down and help them. It's just the government
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:48.600]  in our life, as MSNBC says, your kids belong to the state. And they've said back in the
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:55.680]  40s, 50s, and 60s, I cover it in the extras of Endgame, Endgame 2.0 that's online.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.360]  We show the university studies where they said, we're gonna promote promiscuity so that
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:07.320]  people have abortions, don't have meaningful relationships. We're gonna promote homosexuality.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.120]  Homosexuality has always gone on. And I'm not here demonizing people. The point is,
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:19.000]  is that they're force feeding it, ladies and gentlemen, as just a way to be trendy.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  That's why they're so, I mean, you see the trends now where a lot of women say they're
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.800]  lesbians, but then they end up getting married. Cuz they just go become a lesbian for a while
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:33.040]  cuz that's the trendy thing to do. Or same thing with men. And now they're just saying
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.000]  we're pansexual, we're omnisexual. Humans have always to some degree been like that,
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  mammals are.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.920]  The point is, is that they are artificially trying to amplify it unnaturally with chemicals
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:52.200]  in the food and water to reduce our population numbers and to break up the family. So Clinton
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:11:00.520]  is hailing Supreme Court overturning law. He signed, there you go. I mean, it's just
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.640]  all part of the two-facedness. So nothing belongs to the family. That's why they say
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.920]  in federal documents, do not say husband and wife.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.300]  It's hurtful. Remember those stories about a month ago we covered? It actually says France
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:24.280]  has made it the law. See, a father, see, being straight is a crime, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.760]  I mean, look at how they demonize gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, they're coming
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.080]  after us. Now the average gay person is not into this, but they still will support any
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.840]  policy government puts out because that's their friend.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.040]  That's the friend that wants them to have rights. Is that why the government in 1978
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:50.360]  on record, this has been declassified partially, is part of a Navy program in a hepatitis operation
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:59.600]  in the village there in New York. Gave thousands of highly promiscuous gay men who were having
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.800]  hundreds of partners a month. Very destructive folks, very destructive lifestyle at that
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.560]  level.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:14.800]  HIV, just like Bayer helped pass that around as well. They care about you real good. They
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.840]  like it, you're not gonna have kids. They like it, you're gonna die alone, statistically.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.680]  They like the fact that gay men have the lowest life expectancy. They wanna kill you. The
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:30.380]  last thing they want is for you to ever have the joy of children. But don't worry, they're
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:36.640]  gonna go take heterosexuals kids, they're hunting us, and give them to the gay couples.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:42.240]  That's what goes on. And I'm supposed to go here, take people's kids, I mean, it's liberal.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.600]  Maybe we should sacrifice our kids to a big homosexual alter, maybe have a pyramid and
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.440]  you go up and the gay priests are there and they chop your kid up with a meat cleaver
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.280]  to prove you're not racist or homophobic.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.680]  Every society has done this, in Sodom and Gomorrah, whether you believe the Bible or
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.760]  not, the men come to the door and say, give us those men, come out, we're going to have
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.920]  sex with you. Where did they get this idea of a gang of men coming and saying, we're
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.700]  going to rape you?
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:18.200]  Because in every society, once this starts, the Romans, it was outlawed folks, cuz they'd
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:23.500]  see what happened to other cultures. Rome rose, was stoic, got into this, and pretty
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:29.240]  soon it was Caligula dressed up like a werewolf, raping and killing children. And I bring this
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.120]  up because this is what all elites end up doing, raping and killing children dressed
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.120]  up like a werewolf.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.680]  You don't know about that, look it up. They would have big, hundreds of people laying
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.520]  on the ground at those low tables eating. They had vomitoriums you'd eat and eat and
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.920]  eat and vomit and vomit and vomit and feed the vomit to dogs outside. I'm not joking,
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.400]  look this up, called a vomitorium, where the word vomit comes from.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:58.880]  Or vulcan, vomiting like lava coming out, I guess in the Latin, if memory serves. And
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:08.280]  the whole, that's why I guess it's also vulgate, it means to project out, to speak. And so
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.720]  they would go and do all this. And by the end, it was just ripping children's heads
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.160]  off, stabbing them, chewing their throats out, blood spraying all over the walls.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:22.080]  I mean, that's where this goes. So just understand, that's where this goes, that's what's going
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.860]  to happen, that's where it ends. I mean, look at the BBC, every week or two, someone's being
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:34.120]  arrested and pleading guilty to raping nine-year-old girls and devil orgies and raping five-year-old
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.400]  boys and devil worshipping and necrophilia and hanging out with the royal family.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.280]  And there's so many articles I can't even cover at all, because they just want to get
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:49.040]  it to where they can do whatever they want. You understand that? So there, I've talked
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.160]  about what's happening on that front. By the way, we've gotten in contact, it's a good
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.480]  idea of them, because we pretty much instantly got in contact with some of the people that
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.680]  were blind, copied the email, his good friends from Michael Hastings.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.560]  And I wanna cover that now. Friend Michael Hastings was working on biggest story yet
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:17.840]  about CIA, not about reported love interest or women that the media claim were love interest
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:24.480]  of General Petraeus. Sergeant Joe Biggs says journalists would never have driven at high
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.560]  speed and said that he's talked to the wife, who he's good friends with, and that she's
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.840]  scared to go public.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.720]  And that when she gets more information on what she believes is happening, she will quote
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:44.000]  take down whoever did this. And that everyone that knew him said that he was scared, they
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.140]  were coming after him, they'd never seen him so flustered. And he'd been in combat zones
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.140]  for years, folks.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:53.280]  He was a embedded combat reporter with the Marines and the Army in Iraq for years and
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:16:00.420]  Afghanistan for years. And they'd never seen him even in combat situations act like this.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:06.160]  And you know what happened to him a few hours later. So I wanna go to a clip with Megyn
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.600]  Kelly so we can analyze this propaganda which talks about tinfoil hats and stuff with Sergeant
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.200]  Joe Biggs, who by the way may be on the show today.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.600]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.840]  I have a question whether this was truly an accident.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:31.840]  It's the fact the way that other times we've spoken before and this email I got, it was
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.560]  just very panicked and it didn't seem like something normally we would talk about. And
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.660]  I just felt a gut feeling, something didn't feel right.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:45.940]  But the police say it's an accident. They looked into it, they said, look, he was driving
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:50.680]  fast, it was 4.30 in the morning, it was dark, lost control of the car, went through a red
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.320]  light, hit a tree.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:58.440]  Well, his friends and family, they know him, everyone says he drives like a grandma. So
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.360]  that right there doesn't seem like something that he would be doing. I mean, he had a lot
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.360]  of friends and family that cared about him. He had a good life to live. There's no way
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:11.240]  he would be acting erratic like that and driving that out of control.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.520]  What do you think is going on here? Because we've talked about this a couple of times
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.640]  just because it's getting so much attention on the internet. And people who are close
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:25.000]  to Mr. Hastings are still raising questions, questions about the LAPD and their conclusions
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.320]  that this was an accident. What is the alternate theory that he was murdered, that he was intentionally
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.560]  targeted by someone?
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:41.460]  I don't know that. I just know that from the email to hours later dying, it's just not
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:44.440]  a coincidence like that. Things don't add up. There's a lot of questions that need to
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:51.380]  be answered. I contacted by email Mercedes a day, asked them if it's normal for their
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:58.400]  cars to blow up to that extent for if the engines fly out on a normal basis. I mean,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.320]  these are the real questions we need to ask.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.240]  And what of the, I mean, obviously he was investigating a couple of high profile cases
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:11.400]  he was looking into. He said, Jill Kelly, who was connected with the whole name of Petraeus
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.560]  and General, General Clark. Go ahead.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.380]  His wife today said that that's definitely not true that he was investigating into Jill
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.640]  Kelly.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.440]  Michael Hastings wife says he was not investigating that.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.440]  Yes.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:29.320]  Okay. Well, what was he investigating as far as you know, that would have caused any consternation
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.320]  whatsoever by someone?
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:36.480]  CIA, but from what he said or his last, one of the things that he said is it was going
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.480]  to be the biggest story yet.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.920]  The, you know, you know how people are gonna react to this. They're going to say that the,
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.000]  the tinfoil hat people think the government killed this journalist, uh, by taking over
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.440]  his control of his car, doing something to his car. And, and the other people are going
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.080]  to say, uh, so there are people are going to say that's, that's nuts.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.680]  Oh yeah. Nobody, the government never kills journalists. No, no, no.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.560]  I mean, I can understand both of you points, but like I said, he's not someone that would
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.600]  be driving around erratically like that in the middle of the night. That just wasn't
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.280]  how he was. Um, so that just leaves a lot of questions and a lot of digging that needed
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.520]  to be brought up and answered.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.280]  I'm not going to speculate and say, I think anything because that's just going to make
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.280]  me look crazy.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.760]  Well, no one wants that. We just want answers.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:29.040]  Oh, no one wants that. Asking questions is now basically a crime in this country and
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.960]  that's why they can disappear in your neighbors. And people will say, I'm not going to be kooky.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:38.860]  Don't know where the Joneses went. This is how Nazi Germany happens right now. I mean,
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:43.640]  they are killing journalists all over the place constantly now. And I mean, they've
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.300]  had the troops pull up in Baghdad and with tanks attack the Reuters floor of a building
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:58.080]  under orders. Of course they killed him. They blew his car sky high. It was a car bomb.

[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.120]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the white house at a time when only the

[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:11.640]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:17.220]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:21.540]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really

[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.880]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.920]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:13.400]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:19.880]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:17.720]  By the way folks, we're going to have some breaking news on the Michael Haftings very
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:23.640]  suspicious 98% chance they blow him up. I said if it comes out that he's doing a big
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:30.360]  story, if it comes out that he was on the run, if it comes out the car blew up and people
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:36.760]  are like, no, no, it blew up. This is on Wednesday morning, right after it happened on Tuesday
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.820]  and hadn't got any coverage the first day it happened and it just fits the total MO.
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:49.040]  So we're going to be getting into that. Roman V. Yampolinsky, I hope I'm pronouncing that
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:55.160]  right, he's been on the broadcast before, is a computer engineering and computer science
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:02.160]  professor, director of cybersecurity lab. And we're going to get into his whole bio
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.680]  and exactly where he works now, he's worked all over the place.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:13.740]  And he's the guy that a few years ago started coming out saying, look, we're going to end
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:24.200]  up having a Skynet type of scenario here, if all of this continues. And now, it's all
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.520]  coming true. I mean, here are some of the articles that I've got that will be showing
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.000]  TV viewers on the document cam.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.740]  Forget to take your medication, these pills will tell your doctor. I mean, it just goes
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:42.240]  on and on with your smart meter watching you in your house and ground penetrating radar.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.400]  The establishment is putting the architecture of control in so they can control us with
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:57.240]  the technocracy. What the professor has pointed out is that what's happening here is that
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.760]  the machines could actually do this.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.400]  And I know I butchered your bio, sir, what's most important for viewers out there to know
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.400]  about you?
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:12.240]  I'm a computer science professor. I do research in artificial intelligence and security. That's
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.520]  pretty much what they need to know.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.720]  And I know you've worked at quite a few universities. Currently, where are you a professor?
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.640]  I'm at University of Louisville Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.000]  So the same place when we had you on last time?
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  Yep.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.740]  Wow. I mean, since you wrote about that a few years ago, it's really become a bigger
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:34.600]  issue. And we hear about all these backdoor chips and things. What do you think about
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:43.240]  what the establishment has decided to do with the architecture of the technotronic state?
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.080]  Are you asking me if there are backdoors and majority of the colleges-
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.360]  Sure. I mean, what is your view of the design, the overall design of the technological system
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.360]  being put in?
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:57.480]  Can you be a little more specific about which aspects you-
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:03.280]  Sure. I mean, look, the entire grid is being built so they can spy on us and control us
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.960]  and remote control our cars, everything else. This looks like it's tailor made for an artificial
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.400]  intelligence to be able to take over.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.900]  It does require something capable of processing massive data, big data as we know it. It's
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.880]  not possible for a human being to monitor all the databases, all the sensors. So it
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.740]  definitely would require some sort of intelligent technology. As far as, is it specifically
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:32.120]  built for this purpose or is it just a side effect of having more and more technology
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.480]  in our lives? I'm not really sure about that.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:43.480]  Again, Professor Jampolsky is our guest. This is just a short segment. We'll get more into
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.560]  detail in the next segment. If people want to check out your work, what is the best place
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.240]  to go to? Louisville.edu and then just go to the computer engineering and science program
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.240]  that you had up?
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.680]  Just Google. Google my name, Roman Jampolsky. I'm sure you can put it up on a screen. Also
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.080]  my new book, artificial super intelligence, a futuristic approach. First hit on Google.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.280]  Just look for that.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.600]  That's what I wanted to get you on about today. And then I've been so sideswiped by all this
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.160]  Hastings news coming out, but let's briefly speak about that. The former head of national
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.800]  security, Richard Clark has said these new cars can be taken over and remote controlled.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.520]  DARPA admits that and some are saying he may have been remote controlled and run into
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.800]  the tree. I'm not even saying that's what happened. It looks like a car bomb to me.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:36.400]  My issue is that shows how our society is being taken over.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.520]  You can definitely have ways to hack medical devices, self-driving cars, anything which
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:49.280]  is autonomous can be hacked and compromised and taking over in principle.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.000]  I just have a feeling of dread about what's going to happen with all this going in.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  It is a dangerous, but this is exactly where my research comes in. I'm trying to make those
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.600]  systems safer, more secure, combining security and artificial intelligence in one area of
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600]  research.
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.680]  Well, I know you're a leading expert who really isn't even negative. You just go from a more
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.240]  realistic angle than somebody like Ray Kurzweil that just says, it's going to be wonderful.
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.200]  Heaven, we're going to live forever. There'll be no problems. Put the robots in charge now.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.720]  I'm going to be God. And that's a quote. I don't believe in God yet. I'm going to be
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.720]  God.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.080]  We're going to come back, sir, and talk about your new book, which I need to get and read
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:38.200]  and talk about real scenarios of what we could face if we don't get control of this technological
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:44.520]  development. All this and more straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Our site is infowars.com.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:50.200]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:30:01.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:06.040]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.720]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:17.240]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:21.560]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.520]  be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you

[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:33.680]  That's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:43.160]  we are talking to a professor who is breaking down exactly what he believed from his deep
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:52.000]  research we're facing and a professor continuing here today. Talk about your book. Talk about,
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.280]  you know, the wide ranging situation that we're dealing with. So the book really is
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.880]  about what the future of artificial intelligence is going to bring. Most people agree that
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:06.720]  in the next 20 to maybe 100 years, we're going to see something developed on the level of
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.600]  human intelligence. How is that going to change society? How is that going to impact all of
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:17.360]  us? My book aims to make sure that the humanity is going to benefit from this technology,
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:23.560]  not get hurt in some really significant way. So that's essentially the main theme of the
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:29.880]  book. It discusses ways we can make those technologies safer, hack proof them, make
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:39.640]  them serve common people. Break down for the common person out there
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:46.680]  exactly the type of scenarios that could unfold and have already unfolded with these systems.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:54.360]  So if you realize the number of different jobs who have outsourced to artificial intelligence
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:35:02.680]  systems, they can already control nuclear power plants, airlines, stock trading. Essentially,
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:07.240]  anything of significance is not done by people anymore. And this trend only gets more and
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:12.960]  more severe. At some point, we'll have computers controlling everything. And if it is a bug
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.760]  in the system or if an enemy hacks into the system, this will have devastating effects
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.560]  on the whole society. And of course, that really from my research
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.920]  has been the DARPA plan the whole time, get the whole world to adopt this system, build
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:31.320]  back doors into it. The West then builds the giant cybersecurity commands to offensively
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:35.720]  take over the world, professor, and then build the back doors in to where they can use it
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:41.880]  to suppress and track the general public and even predict the future of mass movements.
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.160]  That's basically from my research what the Pentagon admits they're doing.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.440]  I am not familiar with any insider plans. I can notice things like NSA distributing
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.920]  cryptographic algorithms, which seems like a counterintuitive thing since they're trying
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:00.600]  to break those. So if there was a bad door in their hashing algorithm, for example, I
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.640]  wouldn't be surprised. Professor Jampolsky is our guest. And you
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:13.560]  can find out more about him by checking out his book. And we'll put a screenshot up on
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:19.520]  the screen for people that are watching us on television so they can get the name of
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.640]  that book. It's Artificial Superintelligence, a Futuristic Approach. And you can actually
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.420]  see one of the professor's interviews with us right there, Skynet Rising, The AI Threat
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:37.080]  to Humanity Exists. My issue is, are you more concerned about breakdowns in the system,
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:45.520]  or governments using these to dominate, or an actual AI type artificially aware system
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.320]  coming online, and then that decides to take us out like Terminator?
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.920]  All of the above. My job is to make sure everybody's safe so I can't ignore any opportunities,
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:03.520]  any options. It's easier to study and easier to justify scenarios where someone is hacking
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.740]  into the system externally. Something like a self-aware AI system going crazy is really
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:15.980]  futuristic. We're not quite at that level yet, but something like a government putting
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:20.280]  a back door to control the system, that's quite realistic. That's standard computer
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:27.760]  security. Professor, what do you think of what Ray
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.040]  Kurzweil has to say? Because for me, it's more like a comic book, the way he puts things
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:37.640]  out and he admits he's starting really a new religion. And they're saying you'll either
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:44.160]  merge with the machines or you'll be stepped on like a bug. And they're selling this utopian
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:48.680]  view. But when I look at the real technological development and what the establishment says
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:54.020]  they're really building, it's more in line with something like Elysium, the new movie
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:59.520]  coming out with Matt Damon. Kurzweil is probably the world's number one
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.100]  expert in that field. I mean, he's amazing at predicting what future of technology is
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:11.760]  going to be. He precisely predicted the year a computer will defeat a human chess champion.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:19.160]  He predicted a lot of other technologies. He is, in my opinion, somewhat overly optimistic
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:25.160]  about how beneficial technology will be without spending as much time on possible negative
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.960]  side effects, which I think are just as important. With his recent appointment as head of engineering
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:37.840]  at Google, he definitely has financial resources and other capacity to make a lot of his dreams
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.280]  come true. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a very successful AI program at Google
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:50.360]  as a result of Ray Kurzweil's work. But my issue is the technocrats, I've studied
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.360]  who's running this, and they openly say we may just get rid of everybody. Once this new
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:03.020]  level of evolution takes place, we're talking about genocide here and people playing God.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:06.960]  And I don't think the public is even aware that Ray Kurzweil is able to predict a lot
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.240]  of what's coming in the future because he's an insider and kind of their front man. He's
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:18.540]  obviously a very smart, a big inventor. He is basically the public face of what they're
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:23.540]  planning to do, is my point. I mean, I'm not even an engineer. I go off of what they say
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.440]  they're going to do. And so that's why he knows so much about the goals. I mean, he
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.320]  wants a technocratic world government run by an AI supercomputer where we're reportedly
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.240]  going to be given eternal life by giving up our humanity and merging with machines. Sounds
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:42.840]  like a nightmare to me. Well, even according to Kurzweil, it's not
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:49.580]  going to happen until 2045. What's going to happen more in the near future is actually
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:55.680]  beneficial improvements. For example, people with disabilities might get their abilities
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.200]  back. Blind people would be able to see, paralyzed people able to walk. We're already starting
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:05.280]  to see a lot of this. So there is a lot of benefit to this technology. Of course, like
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:11.000]  any technology, it can be abused, abused by governments, developed super soldiers, all
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.700]  sorts of things. But it's important not to cast all of technology, all of progress as
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:25.940]  bad. There is definitely a very significant benefit all of us can gain from those techniques.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:34.200]  What about the general public with lowered IQs, lower intelligence? They're calling it
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:40.820]  basically computer fog. The language is already shrinking. People are already having their
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:48.320]  brains rewired at a young age in a bad way. Alzheimer's connected to TV watching. I really
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.480]  see a lot of what computers are doing is dehumanizing us and hurting us. It's not really doing what
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.640]  Ray Kurzweil said. There is a lot of negative side effects and
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.320]  especially with kids. I'm personally very concerned about putting robots in a classroom
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.120]  because those things are not tested. We don't know if we're going to get a whole generation
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:11.400]  of children with autism as a result, how it impacts their ability to judge body language.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:17.160]  So it is definitely something to look into and have review boards which shouldn't just
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:23.300]  push this new technology on kids. That being said, again, we are using technology
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:28.000]  right now for this interview. There are clearly awesome benefits to technology if it's used
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.920]  properly. So the important part is to strike this balance between the dangers of technology
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:40.200]  and amazing benefits. As far as this divide between people getting dumber if they abuse
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:45.480]  technology and others getting too much power because we have access to technology, it seems
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:51.080]  that the pattern is for technology to get cheaper exponentially so more and more people
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:57.820]  who are not rich necessarily get access to top-notch technology. Take cell phones. Twenty
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.760]  years ago only the super-rich would have a cell phone. Now everyone has a smartphone.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.240]  A farmer in Africa would have more information access than the U.S. president had twenty
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.520]  years ago. That's incredible. Even if people are not as well educated, they still have
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.880]  a lot more tools at their disposal. They are better connected. So again, it's a two-edged
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:27.040]  sword. We need to look at both sides. Again, my issue is that they're putting all
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.280]  this backdoor tech to spy on us in all the major electronics and then we're having to
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:39.920]  pay for this because of this corporate standardization. I'm saying, Professor, I see the architecture
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.880]  of the system being built in a predatory way. That's my concern.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.740]  And you might be right. I'm not an expert in that. But the only tool we can use to protect
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:54.500]  ourselves is yet more technology. If you're saying there is a backdoor in that cryptographic
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:59.880]  protocol, we need to develop a better open source cryptography to protect people. So
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.960]  we can't turn away from technology. We have to embrace it and take it away from government
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.240]  hands and do it ourselves. Let me ask you this, Professor. In your gut,
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.880]  do you think humanity is going to make it or do you think we're going to destroy ourselves?
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:19.720]  I think we're going to make it. We might change ourselves in the process, not quite as radically
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:25.120]  as what Ray Kurzweil might suggest with cyborgs. But we're definitely going to come to rely
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:31.200]  on technology a lot more. Our education system will change from memorizing information to
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.880]  learning how to search for information. We'll really learn to use robots and computers a
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:44.040]  lot more as tools and assistance for everyday life. So really, many high complexity occupations
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:49.680]  will see robot human teams working together, a doctor controlling a robot surgeon or something
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.720]  like that. Sure. I mean, there's a lot of positive things
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.320]  there. But the globalists don't want the poor people to have access to this revolution.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.480]  That's why they plan to set up a world government, forcibly reduce world population and then
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:08.720]  go forward into the next age of man, as they call it. I mean, take Foxconn, run by the
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:14.760]  liberal trendies who are really authoritarian monsters of Apple with Al Gore on their board.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:20.960]  They have the most oppressive factory subcontractors and demand the highest dehumanization programs
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.720]  available. And then the suicide nets. And so some people commit suicide and they drug
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.520]  them into forced abortions at the Foxconn, reportedly.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.600]  That now they've just ordered, as you know, millions of robots that are now replacing
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:41.360]  the humans with them. So I don't see that nexus point meeting where we bring in robots
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:47.600]  and then we just do more advanced things. Instead, we just get killed. And I think that's
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:52.360]  a path that's been chosen. And Ray Kurzweil is not going to tell people that, but that's
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:58.560]  actually in the deeper literature. And Bill Joy wrote about this back in about 13 years
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.480]  ago, the head of Sun Microsystems, for those that don't know, in Why the Future Doesn't
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.760]  Need Us article. And he said he talked to colleagues and, you know, do we keep people
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.400]  alive and just let them play games all day or do we get rid of people?
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.720]  And most of them said, let's get rid of everybody. So, I mean, I don't know. I think that might
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:19.000]  be something we should talk about. It is and it's exactly what my book is about.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.240]  That's exactly the questions it raises. What can we do to make sure that we are needed
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.880]  in the future? How can we make sure that those technologies are not given too much power?
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.480]  That's exactly my concern. Well, when I heard about your book, I wanted
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:39.600]  to get you on. I didn't know that it's not out yet and I really want to support it. And
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:45.840]  we need people support to get it out. Artificial superintelligence, a futuristic approach.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.600]  And how do people make sure that the book gets out?
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.880]  So it's a crowdfunding campaign. I'm making it open to everyone. They can contribute.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:59.320]  In fact, there is an option to become a contributor to the book. Just Google it. Google the title
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:04.360]  of the book. It's an Indiegogo, which is a crowdfunding site. And you can contribute
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:10.320]  as a supporter. You can pay it over. It's proofreading of the book. The more contributions
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:14.040]  we get, the sooner we'll be able to release the book, the cheaper it would be to print
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.920]  multiple copies. Essentially, I'm looking for a lot of input
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:22.520]  from top researchers. I already collaborated with quite a few people. You can see on the
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.680]  website exactly with whom. But I attend all the top conferences in the field. I presented
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.120]  all the top workshops. I really know what the state of the art is.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.640]  Oh, I know. That's why we get you on. And that's why I guess...
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.200]  I spent the summer working with Ray Kurzweil at Singularity University. I know exactly
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.920]  what their process is. I work with people criticizing him. I work with people admiring
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:50.840]  him. I really try to come as an impartial scientist and disregard the political aspect
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.760]  of it, but find technical solutions to the problem.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.240]  Sure, sure. I didn't even know that you've worked with Ray Kurzweil. And I know you've
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:03.400]  written several other books. But again, I don't want to sit here and judge Ray Kurzweil
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:08.720]  and say he's a bad guy. It's just that he's always promoting world government and pushing
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.280]  all this. And I recognize the stuff he's pushing. I was reading about 100 years ago from the
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.040]  Fabian Socialists and their plan for the world. And you got to hand it to them. They wanted
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.960]  to discover what made humans tick. They went out and found out DNA.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:26.260]  But then you see the type of stuff Watson that discovered it says. And I just know it's
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:31.800]  eugenics based. And in the 40s, after World War Two, the eugenicist remade themselves
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:40.980]  as transhumanist. And I just know that there's a very arrogant anti-human bent in these people
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:45.560]  and they've decided we're junk. And they've decided they're gonna decide our course. I
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.780]  just think the public should have a debate about this.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.360]  And that's what I like about you, professor, is that you're trying to have that debate.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:56.440]  I couldn't agree more. I mean, I talk to people all the time. I just had a lecture to high
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:00.480]  school students who are considering computer science. And those are the questions I mentioned
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.560]  to them. They are going to decide our future. They are going to be the ones designing those
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.480]  systems. What type of moral values do they put in robots, in military robots? What can
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.280]  a drone do? Are they autonomous? Are they requiring human supervision? Can we have a
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.880]  politician who is a robot? There are lots of questions we need to debate as a society.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:22.120]  And those are not easy questions.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:29.560]  Roman Jampolsky is our guest here today. I've been asking a lot of questions, professor.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:36.040]  What are points that you'd like to make that we haven't gotten to yet?
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.280]  I definitely want to give opportunity to all your listeners to participate in a project.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.480]  They can follow me on Twitter, Facebook. I post constant updates about projects, how
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.960]  it's going. I'm always looking for talented students to join the lab. So that's another
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:56.380]  opportunity if any students are interested in doing a PhD, master's thesis in my cyber
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:58.220]  security lab.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:06.660]  As far as the topics, again, we tend to concentrate on what our biases, our background leads us
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:12.660]  to. Some people see it as it's going to kill everyone. Some see it as a heaven, an immortality.
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:16.600]  We need to realize that reality is going to be somewhere in the middle. We're going to
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.400]  use those technologies to benefit us. And if we're smart enough, we're not going to
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:26.440]  end up in an existential catastrophe of some kind where we'll have a Terminator-like scenario.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:29.120]  Ideally, we'll manage to avoid that.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.840]  Exactly. But they've got 30,000 drones, last time I checked, of the predator and reaper
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:41.220]  class. And they're moving the troops to robots. I mean, you can already see the plan to make
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:49.120]  us obsolete. That's my point, is that the major corporations do not have a good view.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.660]  And currently, I believe, from the evidence, we're on a very bad path. That's my point.
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:03.800]  There's a lot of common sense things I can agree with you on. Definitely it's dangerous.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:09.000]  Definitely it needs to be looked upon. There needs to be oversight, not necessarily government
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:16.360]  oversight, but research oversight. We have research review boards for medicine, for nuclear,
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.520]  for chemical weapons, bioweapons. We need something similar for projects related to
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:27.520]  nanotechnology, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, robotics. Not any type of research
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.200]  should be fully funded by the government where nobody knows what the outcome is going to
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.200]  be.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:38.760]  And now you sound like President Eisenhower. I want to come back and talk about the NSA
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.280]  and the fact that any engineer that works in telecommunications tells you the spy hubs
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:48.480]  are there. So, I mean, I know you're nonpolitical, but I want to get your take on the NSA. And
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:53.560]  when you talk about synthetic biology, that's really, from what I've seen, where they're
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:51:01.720]  going. We'll talk about it all with the professor, John Polsky. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:07.920]  Great news, pure water lovers. BigBurkeyWaterFielders.com has a special discount offer for all GCN

[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:24.120]  the phone calls that are holding. We start the next hour and a bunch of news we haven't
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:33.480]  gotten to yet. And then we have one of the friends of Mr. Hastings joining us who got

[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.360]  Back when I was out there 20 minutes ago, that was being confirmed. That's nailed down,
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:49.880]  correct? Okay, it's totally nailed. Okay, well, we'll believe it when we see it, but

[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:12.440]  Going back to the professor, doctor, we only got a few minutes left here, but specifically
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:18.660]  looking at the NSA, the fact that they call it national security that these illegal spy
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.800]  grids, and they are illegal, they're in everywhere. And then people are traitors that, he didn't
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.000]  give away our missile secrets, he didn't give away how fast aircraft carriers can cruise,
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.320]  how many knots. He said, hey, they're doing illegal stuff, that's always been protected.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.600]  What's your view on Snowden?
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:39.640]  I mean, I think terrorists always knew we're spying on them, so he didn't really tell them
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:44.520]  anything new, in my opinion. I know Bin Laden never used cell phones, never used email,
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.520]  always through light and snail mail, and that's why he was so successful at avoiding capture
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:57.040]  for years. As far as normal people, I mean, I was raised in Soviet Union, I pretty much
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:03.240]  assumed government is always spying on you anyways, so also I didn't see much of a revelation
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:09.440]  there. I don't have any political statement to make as to whatever my judgment is in his
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:14.520]  actions, I just don't see it as something very novel.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:21.000]  By the way, Lindsey Graham has come out and called for reading people's mail now, a physical
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.760]  mail, I mean, that's up on infoawars.com. Enemy of freedom, Lindsey Graham says he would
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:30.960]  support censoring mail for national security purposes, they call it censoring to dig through
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:36.640]  your mail. And now they're saying Al Qaeda knows our secrets now, our government's running
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:43.960]  Al Qaeda in Syria, folks. I mean, this is all such a sick joke. Professor, in closing,
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:49.080]  that's where I see the big advances, is in this synthetic biology, that's what I'm really
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.120]  concerned about.
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:56.680]  It could be very, very beneficial, again, we can get rid of a lot of genetic disorders,
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:04.000]  we can design much better plants and foods and medicines, but it could also create horrible
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.800]  biological weapons, it could create terrible mutations, which we cannot test for multiple
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:14.480]  generations of human life, it takes too many years. So they test for a year or two and
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.360]  they release those products, so that could be potentially very, very dangerous.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.000]  Wow, you know your stuff, cuz I've studied it. Yeah, you can have the change in one generation,
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.280]  but by three, it does something completely different. I mean, it is Russian roulette
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:32.600]  all over the place. I wish your book well, people should go check it out. Artificial
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.480]  super intelligence, a futuristic approach to help get it published. Thank you so much,
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:41.520]  Professor. Thank you so much. We'll be right back. Thank you so much for having me.

[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:38.200]  want to talk about every subject you can imagine out there. Frank's listening on 840 AMK CBC.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:43.600]  We're going to go to him coming up here in a few minutes. Jim and listening on info wars.com
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:48.200]  audio streams. We're going to talk to Bruce. We're going to talk to Eric. We're going to
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.240]  talk to Christopher because I'm just doing open phones, whatever topic you want to bring
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:59.640]  up. I already covered this, but man, I tell you, it is chilling to read these quotes that
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:06.080]  I saw in an RT article that then we put in an article. Michael Hastings, a friend of
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.880]  Michael Hastings says he was working on biggest story yet about CIA, and we have that Fox
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.280]  News clip, but then in the RT article, and we have this in detail in our article on info
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:22.000]  wars.com, Michael Hastings wife vows to quote, take down whoever did this.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.080]  And that's reportedly what Sergeant Joe Biggs told Fox News, Megan Kelly, that something
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:32.600]  didn't feel right. And then you have witnesses saying they heard an explosion look like it
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.720]  blew up. The fact that he was saying he was going off the radar. You can't criticize anybody
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:44.160]  for saying this is suspicious. You can't, you'd have to be crazy not to say it's suspicious
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:47.600]  like Pat Tillman.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.800]  And I talked to his brother pretty soon after it happened, and he wasn't ready to come on
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.240]  the air at that time. My producer talked to him and then I got handed the phone and got
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:58.520]  to talk to him. But they were like, we think more happened. We think it's a cover up. And
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:04.480]  then it came out. The coroner wouldn't lie, the army coroner, a lieutenant colonel, and
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:10.880]  said he was killed up close with a three shot burst in the front of the head.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:17.000]  So again, we got criticized then for saying, could this have been some type of assassination?
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.120]  Bare minimum, ladies and gentlemen, they lied about it and said he was charging a machine
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.800]  gun nest. And it was McChrystal involved in that cover up. But he was working on this
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.960]  big story. They put up this other story that he was investigating Kelly, who might or might
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  not have supposedly been about to have a relationship or something with Petraeus.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:43.640]  It's a total distraction, in my view. And the wife of Michael Hastings has come out
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:50.560]  and said that he was not working on that story. It was the CIA and it was the biggest thing
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:57.640]  ever. So we are going to have one of his friends pop in at the bottom of the hour. I'll leave
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.440]  that as a surprise. In the meantime, we're gonna go to break here in a moment, this is
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  a short little segment.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:08.120]  Come back and go directly to your calls, Jim and Frank and everybody else that I just mentioned
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:14.480]  earlier. But they're now in the news telling us, give up all your rights or the terrorists
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:20.320]  will get you. What about the corrupt interests that run the government?
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:26.800]  Aren't they the big threat historically? Eisenhower told a university commencement speech, I've
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:33.160]  read the quote on air, getting back to Eisenhower, that you can have total security, but we'll
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:38.700]  have to put you in prison, to paraphrase the quote. And that's basically paraphrasing what
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:42.360]  Thomas Jefferson said and Benjamin Franklin, they all said, those that give up liberty
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:47.160]  for supposed security deserve and will get neither.
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:53.780]  You don't ever get security, especially long term, giving up your rights and becoming dependent,
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:04:00.880]  you become a slave. And what we have is a bunch of corporate special interests that
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:06.020]  wanna continue wars. That's why they give the last generation of weapons to all these
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:10.800]  foreign governments that we develop, like China and Russia and even North Korea got
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:11.800]  reactors.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.000]  So then there can be a threat and we've got to have this big military industrial complex
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.760]  to fight that, and it just goes on and on and on. And now, millions of dollars per city
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:29.760]  for robots, for non-existent bomb events, and all the movies are about martial law.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:35.680]  And now they're using the NSA to go after whistleblowers. I mean, this is unprecedented,
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.960]  it has a name. It's called organized crime takes over the government, and the name of
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:46.760]  that is tyranny, tyranny, tyrannous.
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:52.400]  Maximus is where we're going, the greatest tyranny the world has ever seen, the maximum
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:05:01.040]  corruption. Phone calls and a special guest in the third hour straight ahead.

[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:05.680]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?

[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:17.880]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:23.560]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:29.360]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.

[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:12.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:21.240]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show. All right, I want to go right to your phone
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:26.000]  calls for the next two segments. Then we have a special guest who was good friends with
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:34.160]  Mr. Hastings, who blew up joining us, unfortunately. Very sad. A really good reporter. I mean,
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:37.800]  that clip where I played yesterday where he before he died a few days before he was on
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:42.780]  TV and he said the press has to organize against tyranny. We have to stand up. The government
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:47.040]  is trying to destroy free press in this country. If the press doesn't stand up for itself,
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:52.440]  nobody will. And then I'm going to do at least 30 minutes of overdrive today with our guests
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:57.200]  that are with us for the next two days, James Lane and Richard Grove, and they're going
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:02.280]  to be with us tomorrow in studio as well because I've kind of moved them into overdrive today.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:06.560]  They're down here down here visiting. They're the makers of the new film that we're pre
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:10.840]  selling and we're going to premiere on Prison Planet TV. But the DVD and the Blu ray of
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.040]  State of Mind is an amazing film that I'm in and a bunch of other people even more knowledgeable
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.040]  than I am are very, very powerful. We're going to be talking about that some of the next
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:25.640]  hour. Right now, let's go to Jim in New Hampshire. You're on the air. Welcome, Jim.
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:33.200]  Well, I love the show and I wanted to make a point about about the use of encryption
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:40.440]  and that we, you know, we should really be considering this as a way of helping thwart
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:47.920]  the NSA's spying on, you know, domestic spying. I think one of the things that, you know,
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:52.400]  there's actually two technologies out there that I want to quickly mention. One is just
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:58.960]  encryption in general, which actually as Snowden mentioned in his question and answer, it's
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:03.640]  actually a really effective way to prevent someone from intercepting your message.
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:07.880]  Well, don't I mean, isn't the best system not even encrypting it yourself, but those
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:12.600]  systems that slice it up a thousand different ways and then recombine it on the other end?
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:17.520]  Exactly. Yes. There are systems that do that. So on the software engineers, that's my background.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:23.280]  And yes, there's a whole bunch of encryption. There's actually different methods of encryption,
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:27.800]  different systems out there. But basically, I just want the users here to know, you know,
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:32.000]  start using it, start looking into it, start researching it, whatever encryption you decide
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  to use. This will help, you know, this will help in that we will have.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.960]  Sure, because, I mean, they can still crack it, but they have to sit there and mess with
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:43.280]  it and put it through different filters. And if there's hundreds of different types of
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.960]  encryption being used, then it's going to gum up their works.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:51.480]  Exactly right. Right. They can still crack it. But, you know, frequently, even even the
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.560]  simplest of these algorithms can take, you know, years sometimes to crack it even.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:02.800]  But also you can use things like start page and other free search engines. So you're through
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.680]  a proxy so that you're not just volunteering to go right to the corporate NSA and just
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:08.680]  give them everything.
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:11.880]  Actually, you're making my next point for me. That's exactly what I was going to say.
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:16.080]  Start page is a great, you know, anything to hide you from Google and hide you from,
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:21.640]  you know, the powers that be. That's a great place to start. Also, look at the peer-to-peer
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:29.160]  networks, peer-to-peer networks kind of disperse the network traffic around so you can't track
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:30.160]  people as easily.
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.360]  You know, the unfortunate part is we shouldn't really even have to do any of this. We should
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.120]  really, you know, we should be able to communicate without thinking anybody's listening to it.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.200]  And again, it's not that you're hiding something. Why do you lick the envelope with snail mail
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:46.360]  so it doesn't fall out so people don't read it? And it's not that you're hiding something
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:51.120]  if you're sending your grandmother some photos of a picnic or something because she asked
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:52.120]  for them.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:55.640]  That's what my grandma was always asking for is photos of the trips and things. She loves
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.560]  photos. She's almost 90 years old, but it's nobody's business. I mean, why do I have walls
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:06.960]  on my house? Why isn't my house glass? I mean, what do I have to hide? Nothing. I want to
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:11.500]  be able to walk around, you know, at midnight my underwear. And I don't think my neighbors
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:12.500]  want to see that either.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:18.640]  You know, I don't look like Kate Upton. So good, good points. I appreciate, I appreciate,
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:26.840]  I appreciate you calling in. I better not make Kate Upton jokes. Because never mind.
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:32.360]  Let's just go ahead and talk to Eric in Pennsylvania. No, no, no, wait, wait. He wasn't next. I
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:40.600]  apologize. Frank on Obamacare listening on 840 a.m. KCBC in Cali. You're on the air,
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:41.600]  Frank. Thanks for holding.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:46.600]  How you doing? First time caller, Alex. The first thing you're the greatest American I've
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:51.040]  ever known. And my prayers are with you for you and your warrior. Oh, my goodness. Please
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:58.960]  come on. We have nothing to fear but fear itself. Obamacare, H.R. 320101 speaks of this
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.560]  implantable chip. It's going to have your name, your phone number, your bank account,
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:06.480]  your dog's middle name and let's be technical.
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:11.900]  It does fund in Obamacare. It cuts funding for all the surgeries and stuff you need and
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:15.060]  let's government tell your doctors what to do. And it's written by insurance companies
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:19.220]  to jack up prices and cut quality of care and bring in the death panels, which they
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:25.220]  now admit they have. But it does fund implantable microchips in the body. And some say that
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:26.520]  means they can make it happen.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:34.360]  But it does fund it and it has this hub system that under law forces all your data illegally
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:39.760]  to give it to all these federal, state and corporate groups. So it's also a big NSA thing.
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:46.360]  Yeah. And another thing, our brains are also on radio waves. So once you get that chip,
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:50.380]  can't they control our minds, too? I mean, it might be specific. DARPA admits for about
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:57.040]  50 years they can put out different wavelengths that calm people or make them agitated.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:02.160]  Just like loud sound can make you agitated or nails on a chalkboard. But this is different
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.920]  harmonics they have. And there is a lot of that going on. Most of it's classified, but
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:13.600]  the existence of it is there. And generally, it wouldn't be a chip they put in you to control
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:20.400]  your mind. They would give you a vaccine that had a synthetic biological nanotech engineered
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:25.960]  virus, which they already have, that goes in and destroys areas of the cerebral cortex
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:28.160]  associated with resistance.
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:34.240]  And they call that the anti-stress vaccine. If you watch the lobotomized biological androids
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.440]  in Disney's The Black Hole, they're not having any anxiety because they've been lobotomized.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:43.080]  I mean, if you watch the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest that accurately shows what
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:47.480]  lobotomy is like, these are more of a slight lobotomy. And there's evidence they've already
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:52.240]  been testing it on the public, where people just can't get upset, but they can still be
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:54.400]  ordered around and told what to do.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:57.920]  But the public's already liked that without the brain eating vaccine, as I dub it. I have
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:01.980]  a whole video on that, just Google brain eating vaccine. They're already liked that to a great
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:09.240]  extent, just from TV and culture. They're taught to shuffle around, just kinda muffling,
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:14.980]  stumbling through life, because they've been spectators their whole life, wired like Plato's
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:20.080]  Allegory of the Cave, to just watch the images on the wall, not to actually be part of the
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:21.080]  real world.
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:26.200]  Wow, all right, that's it, man. Can I plug a book, is that possible?
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:28.200]  Absolutely, you're on the air, brother, we don't screen your calls.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:35.720]  Conspiracy 101, amazon.com has a list of everything that you need to get started and find out
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:36.720]  the truth.
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.960]  Sure, are you listening to us on 8.40 AM right now?
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.960]  You got it, brother.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.720]  Well, that's awesome, I thought they were only carrying us on the weekends.
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:48.360]  No, they got you 9 to 12, man, and right now, that's all I can afford, and I'm so happy
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:49.360]  to hear.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.080]  Yeah, that's a big station.
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:53.800]  Yeah, it's great, man.
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:58.440]  Well, I'll tell you, I mean, it's awesome how many stations put us on on the weekend
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:09.720]  and then we're weekdays in major cities all over the country, Chicago, San Diego, Dallas.
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:16.040]  But the problem is, take Orlando, we were on there one year, the station went from like
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:21.100]  number eight or nine in the ratings to number one with my show.
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:24.720]  And Mand Cal before me, they put us both on, and then they just changed formats.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:31.240]  And it's like being number one on a station up against 50,000 waters, a 10,000 water,
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.840]  and I've done that over and over again.
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.640]  It's like being number one is not enough, folks, I'm not like wanting to beat Rush Limbaugh
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:41.000]  either.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.600]  It's just that we destroyed him, and it was in the news, it was in radio magazines that
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:49.200]  I've gone up against, and I'm not up against Limbaugh on purpose.
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:53.120]  This was the slot I was offered in 1998.
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:56.640]  They said, you wanna go weekdays on this little network, we're putting you out here, that's
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:57.640]  where we have a slot.
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:03.440]  And I went up against Rush Limbaugh, and they said, yes, and so that's why I'm there.
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.160]  I wanted to be on at nights, quite frankly, cuz I kinda wake up at night.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:15.120]  But I mean, I've been up against Limbaugh toe to toe, well, hundreds of times, cuz stations
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.320]  come and go over the years.
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:22.240]  But I mean, there are at least more than 20 occasions that we have come up to him in the
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:24.880]  ratings or destroyed him.
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:31.480]  And again, I'm not trying to destroy him physically, get him off the air, it's just that I will
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.640]  defeat Rush Limbaugh in the free market of ideas.
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:38.840]  People like this show more than his, and I'm on a little radio network that's now got 1,400
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:42.400]  affiliates, not my show, but Genesis has 1,400.
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:45.680]  That's a conservative number, by the way, so we're not a little network, we were a little
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:46.680]  network.
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:48.000]  It's the American dream, it's the idea.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  People want hardcore libertarian patriot news, they want it unvarnished, and they get it
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  here.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.920]  And I will destroy all the competition if I'm put on a level playing field, in fact,
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:01.960]  on a stilted playing field, I'll beat them, but I've never given that chance, cuz the
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:03.760]  stations always sell.
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:07.160]  Thank you so much, Frank, spread the word to all the 840 lusters.
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.200]  Tell everybody, on every station you're listening to us, tell people to tune into your local
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.540]  AM and FM's right now.
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:18.240]  Let's go take a quick call here, Bruce in Michigan, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:23.520]  Hi, I have two practical problems, I wonder if you have answers to them?
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.040]  Sure, brother, I'll try them.
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:31.280]  I got a letter in the mail from the Department of Health and Human Services, US Public Health,
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:35.600]  that's a RTI project 12800.
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:42.080]  It says that I've been chosen among 200,000 people randomly by the Research Triangle Institute
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:45.720]  for a national study on health-related issues.
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:49.640]  An interviewer will come, I'm reading these three paragraphs real quick here, and show
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:55.600]  you their ID card, her name is Jill Blondin, it shows a facsimile of the ID card.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:01.640]  You do not have to participate in this, but then it says in great big black writing here,
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:06.920]  every person who chooses to complete the interview will receive $30 in cash.
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:10.640]  All the information is confidential, assured by federal law, blah blah blah blah.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:13.360]  I wonder, what the heck is this thing?
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.320]  Should I just keep them out of the house?
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:19.520]  What this is, and the people involved in it don't even know this, but RAND corporations
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:24.520]  put out the plans, others have put out similar plans, they're sending now monthly censuses
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:31.360]  to some businesses, yearly to everybody else, it's not every decade, it's hundreds of questions,
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:35.160]  how many guns, how many toilets, I'm going to come back to you and finish answering your
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:40.080]  other question, but they've got all these corporations too, just where you're constantly
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:45.520]  having your door knocked on, you're constantly, we're here to talk to you, and then they file
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:50.240]  it and send it off to the feds, and then they integrate it into databases, so it's called
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:56.520]  HUMET, human intelligence, the CIA now is operating domestically as well, and they're
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:01.700]  just training you to have people in your business 24-7, this is acclamation.
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:07.120]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:13.240]  down in the coming few months. Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this, I'm
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:17.520]  sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:23.320]  hysteria and chaos, but I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:28.480]  agenda is finally accomplished, and everything unravels, only those who know this secret
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:36.840]  info will survive and thrive. Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth. The video at
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:44.760]  123conspiracy.com reveals the real secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo,
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:49.680]  and it's not just in response to mass murders of preparing for war, it's something much
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:58.640]  darker. Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down. Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.

[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:11.200]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:15.480]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could

[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:25.400]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:17.980]  I know for the most part what does and does not work. One World Way is the first and only
[02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:23.240]  unheated whey protein powder from grass fed cows on the market. It retains substances
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:28.800]  that no other whey protein powder has. These nutritive compounds supply life giving nutrition.

[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:12.640]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:17.960]  Yeah, the truth is they call it services and they send you letters and all these different
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:23.400]  agencies do just trying to scare you and answering all their questions. And they've got all these
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:29.080]  private corporations going around and now they've got FEMA Corps, these young college
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:33.060]  and high school students that can't get jobs paid.
[02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:37.280]  In many cases, come into your door asking you creepy questions then going back and reporting
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:43.400]  to the cops on you. I mean, they've got the doctors and the public schools on record asking
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:49.160]  the kids what guns your parents have. That's in the news again today. Every authoritarianism
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.500]  that we've seen around the world is coming here.
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:56.720]  And you know we do it bigger and better in America. Boy, let me tell you. But I don't
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.600]  know the particular group you're talking about. It brings a little bit of a bell. Most of
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:07.840]  these people are literally just doing a job contracted by the government as that letter
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:14.640]  said and that they think they're out helping people. But sometimes though they send another
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:20.680]  group to go match up people that are on disability or other issues to see if you've been telling
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:21.680]  the truth.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:27.560]  And the person coming to interview you doesn't even know why they're coming. They're compartmentalized.
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:35.060]  In fact, most cases they are. So as a rule, I don't talk to anybody. Police come to my
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:40.660]  door and they say, open the door. I'll say, what's it about? And then if they say, we
[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:42.040]  believe there's a robber in the area.
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.440]  Have you seen anybody? And I'll say, nope, I have a good day. Now they say, your dog's
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:51.320]  running down the street. I'll say, thank you, open the door. If bureaucrats come here, I'm
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:56.660]  Secret Service, FBI. I just say, I'm not talking to you. You guys have such a history of lying
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:01.720]  and setting people up. Well, is this true or is this not true? I'm not talking to you.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:07.760]  In fact, I've actually before to the FBI said, see my hand, talk to it. Well, we're gonna
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:13.400]  get a subpoena. Bring it, talk to my hand. Then I go, hey, you know the government chips
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:15.760]  in the narcotics and I follow them out to their car.
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:20.760]  And I stand there as they get in the car and drive off and I'm just like, take some cancer
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:26.860]  viruses, government loves you. Cuz the big lie is, I know they're probably good guys.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:31.760]  The point is, is I don't care. I'm done. I'm not playing games. I'm not gonna play games
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:36.800]  with the system anymore. I'm not gonna play patty cake anymore. I know the people running
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:42.360]  it at the top are a bunch of offshore mega banks that folks are stealing Europeans pension
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:45.840]  funds that they paid for, private and public.
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.200]  I know that the people over the government now are gonna have their way of life destroyed
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:54.660]  as well. So I'm a little bit angry at them, that they're victims too. And they're acting
[02:26:54.660 --> 02:27:00.040]  all high and mighty to me when all I do is study this. I know what I'm talking about.
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.940]  I can have top professors on from any discipline and I know the basics of it and they're always
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:08.700]  blown away by it, not because I'm even that smart.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:12.320]  I decided to become an expert on the world. Doesn't mean I don't make a lot of mistakes
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:17.520]  either, but I try instead of an expert on football, or an expert on how to act cool
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:21.720]  at a party with the guys, or an expert on how to pick women up, or an expert on how
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:26.960]  to go on the best vacations. I decided my life was gonna mean something.
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:32.000]  And I was going to really try to figure out how the universe works from my limited temporal
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.700]  perspective. And I've done it and I've made a difference and I'm nobody. I know there
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:43.160]  are people out there a lot better than I am, a lot of you are. I want you to dare to fight
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:44.160]  tyranny.
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:47.000]  I want you to dare to stand up. I want you to get the new issue of the magazine that
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.520]  has ten bumper stickers in it. You can buy the magazine, the new June, July issue at
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:59.600]  mfallwarsstore.com. I want to change the world for good. I don't wanna just sit here and
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:02.000]  take it. Does that answer your question, Bruce?
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.760]  I think I shouldn't give them an earful, but just say no thank you and-
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:10.480]  No, if you give them an earful, if it's a bad group, and I don't know this group you
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:17.860]  mentioned, then they'll come down on you even harder. It's best to, you have the intel,
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:23.040]  you give them no intel. You don't give them anything and then you move. And I don't mean
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:25.300]  you physically move.
[02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:30.040]  It's all about movement is life, movement is survival. And so it's always be changing,
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.200]  always be doing new things. And don't give them power. If people ever show up acting
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:40.240]  powerful, they'll try to menace you into groveling. And then at a dog-like level, empowers them
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:41.560]  to then abuse you.
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:47.920]  If you are very firm and very serious with people and tell them you need to move on to
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:55.660]  a softer target, predators will move on to someone who's a victim. And I'm not saying
[02:28:55.660 --> 02:29:00.280]  push them off on the next poor sap. Try to get other people around you to not be victims.
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:03.800]  You know, that's what this broadcast is really all about. People always ask me, what is it
[02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:07.680]  and it's hard. I don't wanna be a victim. I don't want you to be a victim. I want you
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:13.240]  to live good. I wanna build a civilization, whether you live in Mexico or Germany, whether
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:17.680]  you live in Japan or South Africa, whether you're black or white, I don't care.
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:21.960]  I want you to be empowered. But when you're not empowered and you're programmed by the
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:28.960]  globalist, you become my enemy because you are following their programming. So that's
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:34.340]  it. You either join the human team or you're my enemy because you are my enemy. They're
[02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:43.480]  coming after us and I refuse to buy their propaganda. I've broken with them. You understand,
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:48.680]  folks? And that's a process. I'm breaking with the new world order more every day. That's
[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:54.000]  how we have victory. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:03.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been
[02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:08.320]  preselected for us? As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:14.520]  the potential of information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:21.300]  looking at how to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state education to the Hollywood
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:26.660]  media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape
[02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:31.320]  our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:35.200]  out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:40.020]  happening so fast. You need to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the opinion of the
[02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:45.680]  American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war. Oh, there's another

[02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:35.560]  it's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. We have somebody
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:41.320]  who has courage on the line. He's told the press that everybody else got the blind copy
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:46.760]  email. The close friends of the associate editor of Rolling Stone, Michael Hastings,
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:50.320]  everybody that got the email where he was basically panicked saying I'm going under
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:56.500]  the radar. I'm going into hiding basically. They may raid our offices. They're coming
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:00.160]  and talking to friends and family, which has been confirmed and the FBI has been saying
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:06.240]  they didn't. That's really creepy. And then his car blows up. And from a lot of the military
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:11.320]  experts we've had on, they say it looks like a car bomb. You get the former national security
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.280]  advisor to three administrations.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:18.400]  Richard Clark comes out and says, well, there is remote controlling of these high tech cars.
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:23.360]  Well, that's well known. DARPA has come out and said that's the case. But if you don't
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:29.240]  look at this as foul play, then there's something wrong with you. I mean, you could say perhaps
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:36.480]  this really happened. But to say don't look at it when day one, I came out and said to
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:40.200]  everybody that, hey, we should look at this.
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:43.920]  I said, I don't know that Wednesday after it happened, the day after I said I don't
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:50.000]  know. But if he was working on a big story, a lot of governments go after people, private
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.280]  corporations go after people. Journalists have always been targeted for hundreds of
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:54.280]  years.
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:58.680]  So to say, it's ridiculous, nobody's been targeted. When I've known journalists like
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:03.440]  Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb, they shot twice in the head. And he said he was getting
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:08.600]  death threats and that he wouldn't kill himself on my show and they killed him. The DC madam,
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:16.440]  same thing. And so this man has a lot of courage. Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs told Fox News' Megyn
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.520]  Kelly that something didn't feel right.
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:24.400]  And he went on in a RT article that we have on infoawards.com, Michael Hastings, wife
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:30.720]  vows to take down whoever did this. That's a quote, that's pretty bombshell. So he joins
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:34.760]  us now and I think the best place to start was who Michael Hastings was.
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:39.560]  House Staff Sergeant Biggs points out in the quotes here that, hey, if this happened to
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:46.280]  me, Michael Hastings would be sticking up and investigating for me. And that everybody
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:50.940]  else is too scared to talk, wow. So wherever you'd like to start, sir, I appreciate you
[02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:51.940]  coming on.
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:55.120]  Well, thanks for having me on.
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.600]  You bet, you've got the floor. I mean, tell us whatever you think you should get across
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:35:59.600]  to people.
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:05.680]  All right, well, like you said, back in 2008, I was deployed in a south province in Afghanistan.
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:12.600]  And my commander pulled me in his office and he's like, well, we're gonna have two embedded
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:17.400]  journalists, a photographer and a, well, a photographer and a journalist. And they're
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:22.880]  gonna follow you around for the next week or so. The next week or so turned into almost
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:30.600]  about three months. And you get to learn a lot about a person in one day of combat, let
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:37.320]  alone three months of being around them. He was, this was his first time in that kind
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:45.120]  of a situation too, if I'm not mistaken, actually in Afghanistan doing that. And I was telling
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:49.040]  people, they were like, well, how was Michael? I was like, he was a fearless guy. I mean,
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.880]  I can remember one day in particular, right around the Pakistan border, we were being
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:59.680]  ambushed. And as the firefight is going over, I'm looking on or looking over to Michael
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:02.840]  and he's looking up, he's like, is it over yet? He's like, is there more? And like, he
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:08.120]  just looked excited, like he loved his job and there wasn't a thing to scare him. So
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:14.480]  when the email comes to me and well, from 2008 on, him and I would talk all the time.
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:19.560]  He's asked me how I was doing, how, you know, I was talking about, I was having nightmares.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:24.240]  I was coming back, dealing with a lot of stuff with, you know, some deaths of people over
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.240]  there. And it was just a hard time. And Mike was one of the guys that called me up from
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:33.280]  day, you know, time to time and check on me. So we built a pretty strong relationship in
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:37.480]  that sense. And from time to time, he would email me and tell me about stories he was
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:41.240]  working on and asked me what I thought about this. If he ever wrote about something that
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:44.600]  he had to do with the military. I remember when the story broke on General McChrystal,
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:50.720]  he gave me a call and he's like, man, I'm pretty scared. And you know, I told him, I
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.160]  was like, you got to have a reason to be brother. I was like, you just basically got a general
[02:37:55.160 --> 02:38:01.120]  level war fired. I'm pretty sure that doesn't fit too well with him right now. And he went
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.600]  on to just share concerns about how, you know, he knew there was probably a chance that people
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:11.920]  would be looking into him. And I completely understand that. So last Monday morning, I
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:16.040]  wake up and I get the email from Mike and usually the email start off with, hey, brother,
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:19.920]  how's it going? You know, how's your family? How are you adjusting to civilian life? Cause
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.360]  I'm out of the military now. This time it was just that everyone has the email because
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:28.920]  I released it, you know, saying that he believed that the FBI was going to be investigating
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.760]  his colleagues and close friends. And it just didn't seem like something that he normally
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.560]  started the email off with. And when I read it, I just got this horrible feeling. I'm
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:43.000]  like, something's not right. I immediately called him, but I didn't get an answer. I
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.440]  was like, well, he's probably busy. So I go to school and try to brush it off. I told
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:50.000]  the team, my friends were like, you know, what do you think about this? I don't think
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:55.240]  something's right. You know, what if a friend sent you this email? How would you react?
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:00.520]  And a lot of them were like, man, that's scary stuff. I don't know what to do. So I go to
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:03.960]  a work event. I come home and a friend calls me that night. She's like, Hey, did you hear
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:08.680]  what happened to Mike? And I said, what do you mean? Yeah, he died in a crash. So I jumped
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:15.480]  on the part of my TV, go on the internet and started looking up stuff and sort of watching
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:20.360]  these videos and things just getting out of, you know, first email that I'm reading that
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:25.140]  he called the WikiLeaks lawyer, which that I'm not sure about. I know he contacted a
[02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:33.000]  lawyer in recent days, but the whole WikiLeaks lawyer, I'm not sure about that, but then
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.160]  in the crash, why was there an investigative reporter happened to be filming with his dash
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:43.240]  and right as Michael drove by, I mean, who's out filming an empty street at four something
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:49.600]  in the morning. I mean, all these alarms are going off. My gut feeling from day one from
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.160]  before it happened, I knew that something wasn't right. There's so many things that
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:40:01.240]  added up and did Afghanistan and all those years of combat, did that hone your gut instinct?
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:09.200]  Yeah, I just, just, just anybody who knows someone and they act out of, out of a breeze
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:13.680]  and out of like their normal behavior, you know, that should go off on, that should send
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:16.880]  a red light off to anybody, you know, that's had a close friend.
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:20.360]  Let's talk about, let's talk about, and then all the points you want to get into, but let's
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:24.520]  talk about why you decided to go public. You talked about the rest of the people that were
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:28.880]  sent to email as close friends and family like yourself are scared. And I know you've
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:32.840]  had a chance to talk to some of them, describe how they're scared.
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:37.480]  And then there's the FBI denying he sent emails and stuff. Meanwhile, you know, there was
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.480]  an email, so I guess that's why you released it or correct me if I'm wrong, but let's get
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:46.920]  into they're too scared to release an email that the FBI may rate us and they're talking
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.360]  to my friends and family. He wouldn't lie about that. And then meanwhile, I'm going
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:52.360]  off the radar.
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:56.920]  That's I'm going into hiding. Wow. I mean, I hope I don't say I'm going into hiding,
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:00.640]  look out. And then my car blows up. I mean, wow.
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:07.120]  Yeah. Um, I, uh, I actually emailed some of the people that were on that, that he sent
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:12.160]  the names on the email to some of the people in Buzzfeed. And I said, Hey, did you guys
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:16.800]  get that email? Now he's dead. Does anybody else think that's weird? I got one response
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:21.400]  back. Yeah. And then I go, yeah. Question mark, question mark, question mark. That did
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:25.760]  it. And I waited five minutes. And I mean, five minutes, you know, after your friend
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:29.720]  died seems like an eternity and no one's saying anything and I'm getting on the internet
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:32.600]  and I'm like, all right, somebody has got to come out and say something. Someone's
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:38.600]  got to, I can't be the only person that thinks this is just weird. So I asked my mom asked
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:41.200]  some people and they're like, well, what, you know, I was like, what should I do? And
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:44.640]  everyone's like, and that's some scary stuff to get into. And I just sat there for
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:50.400]  a minute and basically said, F it, I'm just going to do it. And Mike would do the same
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:56.400]  thing for me. He's not going to sit back and roll over. And you know, I'm not a journalist.
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:02.080]  I'm not an investigator. I don't know what steps to take. All I know is I lost a friend.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:07.560]  I'm pissed off. I want to find out what happened. And like I told his wife and some
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.120]  of his other friends, I'm going to do whatever the hell I got to do to figure this out. And
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.240]  then at the end of the day, it turns out to be an accident, then whatever. But right now
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:18.560]  stays on Adam to be that way. There's too many unanswered questions that need to be
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:25.640]  sure. Let me tell you, when you're really going to wake up, I've been physically attacked
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:30.760]  by the shadow government. I've been threatened. I've seen amazing things. And so many times
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:36.040]  that's why we've got to engage investigative journalists and investigative journalism is
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:37.040]  show.
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:42.840]  You'll find out for yourself how corrupt things have gotten. I mean, look at the NSA
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:48.120]  being used against the associated press. Look at pro-life groups and tea parties being harassed
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:53.380]  by the IRS. I mean, this government is out of control. It's been persecuting journalists
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:58.760]  and whistleblowers like no other president before them. And so it's not a stretch to
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:03.920]  say, hey, he's got the biggest story ever. Tell us about that. I mean, that's in the
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:07.160]  email. And he also reportedly told his wife that.
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:13.760]  But specifically give us what info you have. Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs here joining us
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:18.560]  in an in-depth interview, not just sound bites on Fox News. I mean, for me, that's big, too,
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:22.480]  that I'm on this big story. The FBI is probably going to rate us. They're questioning people.
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:24.680]  I'm going into hiding. Boom.
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:32.960]  Yeah. Like I said, just that all that leading up to that email and that happening. And there's
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:37.920]  too many. He was on edge. I mean, everyone that knew him was agreeing. The day is leaving
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:43.040]  up. He was very on edge. And like you said, in the subject line, mentioning the NSA and
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:46.200]  the thought that the FBI was pushing his friends and associates, that alone makes the death
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:49.000]  soon afterwards suspicious.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:52.960]  Let me say this. Let me say this while I have you. I'm begging you to get ahold of his wife
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:57.600]  who you know. And believe me, I've studied this. I can put her in contact with national
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:02.280]  security whistleblowers and people that have really fought the system and won. Whatever
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:09.160]  she knows the investigation was, she's either got to tell the government, call the FBI and
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.560]  say, I'm never going to talk about this. Or she's got to go public with all of it. And
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:17.800]  the safest thing is to go public immediately.
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:22.320]  Do you have any idea what it was dealing with the CIA that he said was the biggest thing
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:23.320]  he'd ever had?
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:28.520]  That's all she knew. He didn't know anything else. She told me. She said Mike would not
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:33.320]  tell me anything. She said, you know, basically from the sound of that would just be for her
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:34.320]  own protection.
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:35.320]  Yeah, of course.
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:42.760]  I spoke to her at the Memorial Service. What was it? This past Saturday, a buddy of mine
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:47.720]  called me and said, hey, there's a plane leaving in two hours. Let's go up there to the service.
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:52.840]  So I hopped on and flew to Vermont and stayed at a hotel up there and then went and called
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:45:00.000]  his wife and family. And, you know, she pretty much came out and said that he wouldn't tell
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.800]  her anything at all. So I don't think you're going to get anything out of her in that sense.
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:07.400]  Well, that's good for her. That's good for her, because if he told any other colleagues
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:12.000]  anything, they're all under NSA surveillance. And if this was a hit, which my gut and all
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.680]  evidence says it was, there's going to be more deaths on this.
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:20.920]  Well, I mean, I wouldn't be lying if I wouldn't say I wasn't checking my car every damn day,
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:21.920]  I'll tell you that.
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:26.220]  Well, that's because you've lived in the real world. I feel sorry for the sheep out there
[02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:32.240]  that don't realize that the press is under attack. Did you see him on the Young Turks
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.800]  shortly before he died, Mr. Hastings?
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:40.280]  Yeah, I was just watching that last night.
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:44.920]  He said, we declare war on this corrupt system that's declared war on the press. The press
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:50.200]  has to stand up together. And they were afraid of that Colonel Travis type attitude. I'm
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:52.160]  telling you, they were scared of him.
[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:56.240]  Well, Michael wrote one of his books and read it that he had been told, if we don't like
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:01.880]  what you write, we'll hunt you down and kill you. So, I mean, that's, you know, for him
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:06.960]  to say something like that, those are his own words. That's pretty, pretty intense.
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:09.800]  I haven't read the books, but obviously I need to look them up. You know which one of
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:10.800]  his books?
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:14.760]  I can get back to you on that one. I mean, that'd be-
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:19.440]  I'll search it. Guys, search Hastings books. There's The Operators and there's one other.
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:20.440]  I read part of The Operators online.
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:23.840]  See, I'm in The Operators. I don't think it's in that one.
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:31.480]  Yeah, no, I've been, listen, listen. People that haven't gone through this just don't
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:35.320]  know. I mean, I've had them call up, tell me what I was talking about on the phone,
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:38.720]  just so I know who it is and then threaten me. I mean, this country is just in a lot
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:39.720]  of trouble.
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:40.720]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:41.720]  Listen-
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:53.000]  With the interview yesterday, though, with Megan Kelly, I was pretty, pretty upset because
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.560]  I was asked to, you know, some topics I wanted to go over. And soon as I got there, it was
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:02.040]  just kind of bing, bang, boom. She kind of didn't really give you a chance to, you know,
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:03.040]  discuss them with her.
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:05.880]  Well, sure, you've got that chance now. You've got, what are the points you want to make
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:06.880]  here?
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:11.440]  Well, you know, I, like I said, I'm no journalist and I don't know how to go about all this
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:16.880]  stuff. But I mean, I wrote, I reached out to Mercedes-Benz and wrote an email and I don't
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:20.840]  know how often they're able to get something like this. But I mean, one of the things that
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:26.400]  you need to find out is how often in, in fact, with Mercedes-Benz, and on top of this, let's
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.040]  remember Mercedes-Benz is one of the safest types of cars there is, especially nowadays,
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:37.760]  that an engine, you know, comes out. And looking at the fire from that, I've been blown up
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:42.880]  in Iraq and Afghanistan and completely engulfed in flames, but it never looked that bright.
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:49.760]  I mean, it never looked that big. And I can tell you from first-hand experience from surviving,
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:54.880]  you know, IED explosions, it was never at that magnitude that that car just, you know,
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:58.600]  just explodes from hitting a tree.
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:05.560]  Yeah, I've been told it looks like five to eight pounds of plastic explosive, probably
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:12.040]  underneath the car, right where he was sitting or in the dashboard. And they debate whether
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:15.760]  it was 30 yards up to 50 yards or longer than it shot this.
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:20.440]  I've heard up to 100. And you know, and another thing is I want to say, and they saw sparks
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:24.840]  before the impact. And then another person inside their house said that it sounded like
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:29.880]  a bomb going off. So, you know, cars hitting trees don't sound like bombs going off.
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.780]  Plus, I've seen the photos, Sergeant, Staff Sergeant, it looks like they came to rest
[02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:40.160]  up against a tree. The witnesses said it blew up in the street and jackknifed and then basically
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:41.320]  then was thrown into a tree.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.000]  Yeah, yeah, well, that's what I think as well. I was talking with my buddies earlier, the
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.520]  way the engine's lying, it had to have come out before even being near that tree. I mean,
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:53.880]  the car's not going to hit a tree. And then the engine, it would have been some kind of
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:58.800]  mark where the engine had ricocheted off the tree and gone in some direction instead of,
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:03.080]  you know, in the same direction of travel before this, you know.
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:06.640]  Yeah, that's right. The car, according to like three witnesses, blows up in the street.
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:10.800]  The engine flies out the front down the road. Then it comes to rest up against a tree. If
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:16.240]  it, if it hit on the side and the engine broke off, which according to engineers, they say
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:20.800]  they're so bolted to that frame, it'd be incredibly hard to even break it loose. It would have
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:25.120]  shot through the fence into the person's house, not the opposite direction down the road.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:30.920]  Yeah, well, we definitely need an independent expert investigation and I'd love to try to
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:36.040]  get a, uh, on the person to rest and have it examined by someone. That'd be fantastic
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:41.080]  on all ends because I really don't trust the LAPD to be making some sound decisions on
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:46.000]  something like that. I mean, how do you rule out foul play as a matter of hours?
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.640]  Yeah, absolutely sir. And then Breitbart, they announced he died of a heart attack 45
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.400]  minutes after he was at the hospital. That that's never done. The coroner wasn't even
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:50:00.880]  there. And then the guy that did the coroner examination died of poisoning a month later.
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:06.280]  I mean, this is, come on folks, this, this is getting insane. Now, now expanding on this,
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:11.120]  when did you talk to his wife? I mean, was it at the funeral or via email? Uh, was it
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:17.000]  the Memorial or, or via email where she said that I'm going to take down whoever did this?
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:23.080]  She, uh, when we were at the service, she pulled me aside and talked to me and she was
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:27.560]  like, you know, thanks for having, you know, basically the courage to do this and trying
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:34.440]  to help out. And she's like, you know, I'm definitely, you know, she, she, she's like,
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:38.360]  I'm going to do what I can to look into this with everything I got. And you know, the key
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:41.240]  when she did it, she put her hand on me and she just gave me this look. And I mean, she
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:46.040]  looked like a pit bull, you know, like she was protecting a person she loves more than
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:51.200]  anything and she pissed off. And it was the hardest thing for me to see because you could
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:58.960]  see how bad she was torn off. And it was just, it was a horrible, just to see that, you know,
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:04.440]  that man was loved by so many people. He was a great guy. A lot of people hated him when
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:09.680]  that story with McChrystal broke, they hated him. But I tell you right now for the soldier,
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:14.600]  I got much respect for that man. I respected the hell out of him. He spoke the truth and
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:18.580]  he wasn't afraid to tell anybody that and if they lied, he'd call him out. You know,
[02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:23.760]  why all of a sudden is it wrong to be truthful and not stick up for the right?
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:29.320]  There was a gentleman who went by the name Colonel Six out of Dallas, a African American
[02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:32.400]  member of the military. And he would send me all this great info and said McChrystal's
[02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:36.600]  going to go down soon and stuff. And then about six months later, he did. And then Colonel
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:39.960]  Six said, I've got intel I'm going to give you. This is on record. And then it was in
[02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:44.960]  the news the next week. He committed suicide in Fort Worth. And it turned out he was everybody
[02:51:44.960 --> 02:51:48.880]  he said he was, Colonel Six was his nickname.
[02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:52.320]  And people can look up the guy's full name and everything, but it's just so many people.
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:56.000]  And I'm not trying to scare people for the globalist. I want people to understand though
[02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  you've had a lot of military investigators killed that investigate missing money. There's
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:06.880]  so many examples of this. And we need to stand for the free press in the memory of Michael
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:12.440]  Hastings. And I'll say this, I didn't really know who he was, but I didn't know if I really
[02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:17.040]  respected him totally or not. Because I wasn't sure until I saw interviews he did about the
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:18.300]  NSA.
[02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:21.720]  And saying we've got to come together. The government's coming after us. They're thugs.
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:27.440]  This is illegal. We've got to organize for American freedom. It was so powerful. And
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:30.380]  then I saw other interviews and it seemed in the weeks, because then I went back and
[02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:33.840]  watch more. I went and watched interviews from a year ago, six months ago, they weren't
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:34.840]  the same.
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:39.760]  Two weeks before he died, he was doing interviews and was energized with like he discovered
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:44.840]  incredibly bad things. And I mean, did you notice a change in him in those videos?
[02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:50.720]  Yeah, definitely. Yeah, when I was watching last night, I could definitely see a fire
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:57.080]  under him. He was definitely pretty motivated.
[02:52:57.080 --> 02:52:59.520]  Wouldn't you like to know what he discovered?
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:07.680]  Yeah, I do. I mean, we've just got to, like I said, slow and steady wins the race. It's
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:11.800]  just something that's not going to be figured out immediately. But I just got to have patience.
[02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:16.960]  And I've reached out to people via Twitter and a lot of people have really come forward
[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:20.560]  and been willing to help me. I got a guy that lives in L.A. who's pretty much expert with
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:21.560]  the phobias.
[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:26.800]  He's already sent one to the FBI and the FBI has already sent back the letter. And he sent
[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:30.800]  me a copy saying that they've received it and we'll be looking into it.
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:38.080]  Listen, all you've got to do is this. You've got to start a defense fund on one of the
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:46.920]  crowdsourcing sites or just set up a PayPal or something to get the basic money to go
[02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:53.720]  out there for like a month. You get his wife to sign a power of attorney to let you get
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:54.720]  the car.
[02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:58.880]  Now, here's the deal. I shouldn't be announcing this on air. They will try to scrub the car.
[02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:03.520]  But if you get there and it's had chemicals, extra chemicals sprayed, it's been scrubbed,
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:07.360]  still you'll be able to find explosive residue. You've got to get it to independent forensic
[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:08.360]  people.
[02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:14.360]  But here's the thing. I got to warn you, just like they killed the coroner at Breitbart.
[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:18.640]  I believe this was a car bombing. Understand, you've been in combat, so you're not a wimp.
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:23.100]  I admire you and I admire Mr. Hastings. I don't know what I would do in this situation.
[02:54:23.100 --> 02:54:27.440]  They will probably try to off whoever goes to try to do samples of that car.
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  I'm telling you, this is serious business. Just like TWA Flight 800 reporters snuck in
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:37.080]  and got the explosive residue that it was a US Air Force continuous rod warhead. I had
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:41.240]  the top general on and blew the whistle, General Parton as well. They arrested the reporters
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:44.260]  and put them in jail for a long time for breaking into the hangar.
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:48.080]  So I'm just telling you, this isn't a game. And I know you know that.
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:55.800]  Like I said before, I'm not making any kind of, I believe this is what really happened
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:03.480]  right now. Like I said, based off facts, things don't add up right now. So whether he be murdered
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:10.080]  or it was an accident, I can't rule out the worst that would be him being murdered. I
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.720]  can't rule that out because right now there's no factual proof to disprove that.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:21.760]  So you'd have to be insane to ignore all the things that happened, all the ingredients.
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:27.960]  There's going to be so many people out there. Most people, like you said, they just read
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:32.480]  their news and they just often go to work and they're happy. And that's all there is.
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:36.160]  And they go on about it and come back to their homes or pipes, being on the white-ticket
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:40.280]  fences and everything's all lollygags and happy and all that stuff. But they don't realize
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:46.960]  that what people go through to really stick up for this country and things like that.
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:50.760]  And there's a lot of people out there as well that are willing to do whatever they have
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:53.480]  to do to keep from their secrets down.
[02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:56.920]  Absolutely. Well, I can only respect your incredible courage. I'd like to continue to
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:01.800]  get you on as things unfold. And if you need any help investigating this, if the family
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:06.080]  wants me to, I'm willing to go to Los Angeles. I mean, I'm committed to this. And if they
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.960]  kill me, I want people to investigate what happened to Alex Jones, just like you're doing
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:12.520]  for your buddy.
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:19.560]  I believe that Mr. Hastings is directly in heaven because God loves people that have
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:25.120]  courage and God hates cowards. Speaking, if you could talk to Michael right now, Staff
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:28.040]  Sergeant Biggs, what would you say to him?
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:34.880]  That he was, it was amazing to see the amount of people that he affected through his life.
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:39.960]  I just felt that one day that I'm able to have that much of an impact on people's lives
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:46.000]  as he did. He was loved by many. He was a fearless man. He was one of the greatest people
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:51.800]  I've known. And I have unwavering respect for this guy. And like I told his friends
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:57:00.240]  and family, I'm not going to sleep on this. I'm committed and he should know that we're
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:05.680]  not going to just sit back and roll over because I know if the roles are reversed, he'd do
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:07.080]  the same thing for me.
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:10.520]  Well, Pat Kelman's brother pushed and they found out he was murdered.
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:11.520]  Yeah.
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:18.520]  Well, God bless you, man. I really respect you. And that's why I say our military is
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:23.080]  such great people. Even of these wars, many of them are corrupt and wrong. The people
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:28.200]  that are doing it got in for the right reasons and have just done things. The average public
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:31.480]  has no idea how hard it is.
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:36.040]  And Mr. Hastings was in a war for freedom in this country and he said that. And I just
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:40.560]  want to commend you for what you're doing, Staff Sergeant. We got about a minute left.
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:41.560]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:48.000]  Like I said, if anybody has any kind of information or anything like that, I just, you know, I
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.800]  can contact you and you guys can get a hold of me and you can find me on Twitter because
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:54.680]  everyone has been able to do it recently.
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:57.840]  Give us your actual Twitter account.
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:02.720]  At R-A-M-B-O-B-I-G-G-S, at Rambo Biggs.
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:06.680]  At Rambo Biggs. What are your buddies who I know work in explosives in the military?
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:08.560]  Do they think it looks suspicious?
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:14.400]  I haven't talked to many of them at all right now. Just coming back from the service the
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:20.160]  other day and being bombarded by so much things. I'm just I'm finally today I'm going to get
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:24.840]  a chance to sit down and just try to make some calls and figure some stuff out.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:28.120]  All right. Well, God bless you. And I'll say bye to you right here at the end. We're going
[02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:34.000]  to go into overdrive, folks, everybody out there. So stay with us. But pray for Mr. Biggs
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.640]  and pray for the wife of Mr. Hastings. Pray for everybody and pray for those BuzzFeed
[02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:40.800]  people who better release the info.
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:51.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:06.920]  or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out simply safe. It's a new
[02:59:06.920 --> 02:59:12.520]  do it yourself home security system that is completely wireless. Go to get simply safe
[02:59:12.520 --> 02:59:18.360]  calm. Simply safe is independent and off the grid. It runs on battery power. So even if
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:23.200]  the grid goes down, you're protected. It's completely customizable. So you can use it
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:30.120]  in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed. Get simply safe calm. Simply

[02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:57.680]  simply safe calm. Coast to coast direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.680 --> 03:00:11.080]  Broadcasting Network network. Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You
[03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:19.280]  want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live
[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:36.320]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and I was just
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:41.960]  giving Sergeant Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs during that little break at the end of the
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:47.720]  hour briefing. I wasn't trying to scare him and I could tell it was concerning him. But
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:52.280]  I was telling him in the MO who they tend to use to blow people up in this country.
[03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:58.640]  It's a mafia, it's a sheep-depped army units. And they've got the hostage rescue team as
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:04.440]  the cover for the FBI's black ops. And they killed a couple of those guys who were in
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:09.880]  and around the Boston bombing and threw them out of a helicopter. I mean, this is not a
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:16.040]  game. And that's why I told him point blank, even though he's been around the real world.
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:23.880]  I was just telling him from my perspective, this is what I know. And a lot of it's been
[03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:30.680]  declassified. A lot of it's been declassified, but they have large hit teams in this country
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:34.320]  who are mainly killing drug dealers and people that don't launder the money through the right
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:35.320]  banker.
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:41.040]  And that's mainly what they do. I wasn't trying to freak him out either. I just was being
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:44.600]  honest with him and I said, listen, they're listening to your phone too. I just think
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:50.560]  people need to understand, it's good to know, this isn't a game, this is real, this is going
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:57.920]  on. And if they blow me up or hang me or whatever, it is baloney. I don't even speed anymore.
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:06.820]  I've been honest. In the past, I would have a little fun on an open highway. I drove home
[03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:13.960]  last night below the speed limit. Just because I got kids, they're now, I've had kids for
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:17.440]  years and I just have gotten used to driving safe.
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:24.320]  And so if I'm ever driving and I see 100 mile an hour wreck, I do not speed anymore. I mean,
[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:29.280]  every once in a while, I'll catch myself. If it's a 70 mile an hour, I'll catch myself
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:34.320]  going 75 or something. But I mean, speed limit's pretty fast at 70 or 75. I guess I'm just
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:36.960]  getting old or something, trying to drive like a grandma.
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:40.600]  Actually one of my grandmothers drove like a bat out of hell, the one that died, Meemaw
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:49.080]  and Patty. But the point is, is that if there's a high speed car wreck, I don't speed anymore.
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:59.240]  It's almost pointless to have a charger. I don't use drugs other than occasional beer,
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:01.480]  glass of wine and a cigar.
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:07.320]  And I mean, the last tobacco I had was when I smoked a pipe on air to point out that some
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:15.600]  pipes are illegal in Florida now. So I don't do illegal drugs. I don't do prescription
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:23.660]  drugs. I don't speed. I don't, they love to kill a hooker and kill you and throw you in
[03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:25.200]  bed with them.
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:28.060]  That's one of their favorite things or drug you and then put you in bed with a dead hooker.
[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:32.960]  That's one of their favorite tactics. If that ever happens, I don't do that. That's a lie.
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:35.880]  There's a lot of ways they can kill me or if I have a heart attack and they go, he was
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:40.200]  overweight. Folks, if I'm wearing underwear, folks, I don't look like I'm overweight when
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:41.200]  I'm bent over.
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:45.800]  I've got somewhat of a belly because I've got a long torso. I can swim five miles if
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:51.320]  I had time. I can swim two miles, I'm gonna be tired. I can go hike up an eight mile mountain
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:56.560]  and do it again hours later. I can jog three miles, no problem. I'm not in great shape,
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:58.760]  but I've had my blood pressure checked, everything.
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:06.480]  My heart's in great shape. I'm in great shape. And so if I have a heart attack, I'm 39 years
[03:04:06.480 --> 03:04:12.680]  old, they killed me. I don't have any heart problems. I've had checkups. I'm fine. I'm
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:21.000]  healthy. And I'm telling you, if I die mysteriously, folks, I want everything turned over. I want
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  investigations.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:27.600]  I want third party autopsies. I want my car blows up. I want it immediately impounded
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:35.160]  and I want it tested for every known explosives residue. And I was telling him that during
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:37.440]  the break and he was saying thank you, but I could tell it was bumming him out. I could
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:44.600]  tell he really liked Michael. And it's also a bummer to know that we have to think about
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:47.060]  things like this.
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:54.320]  But we salute Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs and we salute everybody else that's standing
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:59.400]  up for him and we salute his wife who said take down whoever did this. We'll be right
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:00.400]  back.
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:07.320]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the info wars dot com team want to relay to

[03:05:51.080 --> 03:06:01.760]  The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. We all

[03:07:02.560 --> 03:07:06.760]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[03:07:06.760 --> 03:07:12.440]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:18.020]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:22.360]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:27.300]  be a problem? e Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you

[03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:07.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[03:08:07.280 --> 03:08:15.280]  a war on for your mind.
[03:08:15.280 --> 03:08:33.360]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in overdrive and tomorrow we'll have these gentlemen
[03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:37.520]  during the main show in the noontime hour back in studio with us. They would have been
[03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:45.560]  last hour, but we had Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs on who, again, was in heavy combat in vehicles
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:52.080]  blown up by large bombs, IEDs. And the engines blown down the street in the opposite direction
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:54.800]  of where the car is resting up against a tree.
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:58.920]  He knows explosives. He's like, this just doesn't fit. Something very serious is going
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:05.460]  on. This isn't a radio show about entertainment. I mean, sometimes because I'm a human, I joke
[03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:10.680]  around and stuff because I can't stay serious all the time. I've got my life in my hands.
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:17.160]  I know a lot of people that have been murdered in every big event like this just to cover
[03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:19.960]  up other murders.
[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:24.720]  And we're going to have a studio with us today, but also on the nightly news in more detail.
[03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:31.920]  And then back tomorrow in studio, two gentlemen, James Lane, of course, who was involved in
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:38.160]  the film, A Noble Lie, that we also sell at Infowarsstore.com, and Richard Grove. And
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:43.360]  Richard Grove's site is tragedyandhope.com. freemindfilms.com is the main site for their
[03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:44.360]  films.
[03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:47.880]  I'm the exclusive distributor in the first three months or so of State of Mind that when
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:51.120]  I saw it, I just said, well, I'm going to get behind this. I'm in it. It's got a bunch
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:54.280]  of people in it. We're going to talk about this film and preorder it now. It ships on
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:59.840]  the 15th of July. It premieres on prisonplanet.tv. And we're going to do a big taping tomorrow.
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:03.160]  It's actually tomorrow where we're going to talk about the film beforehand, stop a few
[03:10:03.160 --> 03:10:05.560]  times and talk about parts and developments.
[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:09.920]  And it's going to premiere for prisonplanet.tv viewers. I appreciate you guys having us do
[03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:18.680]  that. It's going to premiere on the 17th of July, that Wednesday here coming up next month.
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:23.600]  But it's very important to support independent filmmaking. It's very important to wake your
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:27.600]  friends and family up. And believe me, this is a very professional film. I'm very honored
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:31.880]  to be part of it. It's even better because you get better as a filmmaker than their noble
[03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:36.560]  lie that was a premiere film that was better than probably what I could do in many cases.
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:41.140]  So they're just just just just really doing an incredible job with the rest of their team.
[03:10:41.140 --> 03:10:46.320]  And you can get the film at State of Mind, The Psychology of Control. And until it sells
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:52.360]  out, which should be any day now, the first 5000 orders, you can get free the animated
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:55.400]  film on the history of the Federal Reserve. It's very entertaining, great to wake people
[03:10:55.400 --> 03:11:01.360]  up. The American Dream. We'll have to take that down the next few days because we're
[03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:05.040]  getting very close to 5000 of these being sold.
[03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:11.940]  So take advantage of that. Nymphowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139. I may be able
[03:11:11.940 --> 03:11:16.160]  to get a better deal and get more of these and bring the special back. But we got a really
[03:11:16.160 --> 03:11:22.640]  good deal on these 10,000 of these, but we sold 5000 of them and have 5000 left. And
[03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:26.240]  I said, well, let's just offer that it's such an important film and we got a really good
[03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:29.640]  deal on it. So I said, let's just offer it free. That's what I do when I get stuff really
[03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:35.640]  low priced, then I just give it to you because my goal is all about waking people up.
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:41.720]  That's why the new magazines out has 10 free bumper stickers in the July issue. That's
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:45.040]  because I want to wake people up. I want to defeat the New World Order. I'm risking my
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:49.840]  life doing this because I've studied history. I want to make a difference. I want to empower
[03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:53.800]  people. Men and women that stand up for justice are what have made everything in our world
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:59.160]  good that's good. And there's always that struggle. Now I was talking to James Lane,
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:05.040]  the founding of Free Minds Films and the director of A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 95 and the psychology
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:06.040]  of control.
[03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:10.440]  And his mission is to alter the information paradigm with hard hitting exposes of state
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:17.180]  crimes and cover ups. And Richard Grove filed for federal whistleblower protection under
[03:12:17.180 --> 03:12:21.120]  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 02. And we're going to get into that because that ties into the
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:26.840]  NSA and everything that's happening right now. And he's just done a whole bunch of work.
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:30.560]  I'm not going to get into this whole bio. You can find out more at tragedyandhope.com.
[03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:35.960]  But I've mentioned this when I start thinking what you said before you went live here, James,
[03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:42.260]  whenever I start thinking about all the people I know that have been murdered, and in many
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:45.040]  cases when it's on record, they've been murdered, nobody knows who.
[03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:48.400]  And in Cop of the Year, Terrence Yakey, and you've interviewed his family, they're in
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:51.960]  the Noble Lie film, he said the feds are after him, he did it with his partner. They pull
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:58.200]  him over, they torture him, shoot him in the back of the head. Then you interview the cop,
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:02.620]  Browning, the head of the K-9 unit that I've had on the show, naming FBI that walked in
[03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:05.640]  and said you and your wife are dead if you don't shut up.
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:11.120]  I know the real world. And I know that it's a mafia that runs this and the parallels of
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:15.400]  Terrence Yakey, Cop of the Year, and him seeing the feds involved in the bombing, first person
[03:13:15.400 --> 03:13:21.840]  respond. And what happened to Michael Hastings, I mean, look at my gut, they killed him. James
[03:13:21.840 --> 03:13:27.440]  Lane talking about that and interjecting with Oklahoma City and the mind control of how
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:29.640]  we just, our government's the good guys.
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:33.880]  It's tinfoil hat they might kill somebody when it's on record they've done this over
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:38.320]  and over again. And then I wanna get a Richard Groves take on this and tie it into his whole
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:41.040]  whistleblower case. So gentlemen, good to have you here.
[03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:43.880]  Thank you for having us on, Alex. Yeah, when I've heard about the Michael Hastings case,
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:48.840]  that was the first thing, well, when the information broke that the feds were following him. That's
[03:13:48.840 --> 03:13:50.960]  first thing I think of as Terrence Yakey.
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:55.200]  And a lot of people would ask us, it's 17 years on, why are you still investigating
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:13:59.480]  the Oklahoma City bombing? Why does it matter? Well, because look at this, if we don't expose
[03:13:59.480 --> 03:14:03.040]  these, we don't show people, this continues to happen. This is still a methodology that
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:05.120]  they will use over and over again.
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:10.400]  But Terry, he was trying to take some documents to some storage, and he said that the feds
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:12.480]  were following him. And that's where they find him dead like that.
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:18.280]  He said, I gotta go, the feds are on my tail. Yeah, and they declared his death a suicide.
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:21.800]  And it was very obvious that it wasn't, I mean, he had lacerations all around.
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:25.920]  It was Vince Foster's, child. He was shot through the top of the head at
[03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:29.600]  a far enough distance that it didn't leave powder residue, etc.
[03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:33.560]  And they got back when they did it, yeah. Right, and this was still whenever the official
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:38.000]  story was real formulating in the public mind. And so they couldn't allow any information
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:42.840]  to come out at that time. It seems like, well, after the operation has occurred, that's okay.
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:45.160]  But- How mad do you think they are that our reporters
[03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:50.760]  took over all those Boston bombing press conferences? They shot the guy that knew the Patsy brothers
[03:14:50.760 --> 03:14:54.680]  in the top of the head too. Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, getting in on the
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:57.560]  front end of it, this is where we're trying to expose this stuff.
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:14:59.760]  If they're gonna kill me for anything, I think it's that.
[03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:03.840]  Well, this is why your show is so important. I mean, who else is putting this information
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:09.000]  out? So yeah, I'm just- I don't mean to obsess on it, it's just my
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:12.480]  gut feels the danger level. I feel the angel of death flapping around.
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:17.920]  I mean, it's kind of interesting. With Terry, he said, when the official story
[03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:20.040]  was starting to unravel, he said, that's not the way it happened.
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:24.760]  He was very distraught over that. And when they said his family's asking questions,
[03:15:24.760 --> 03:15:28.800]  they're like, you're just paranoid, you watch too much TV.
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:31.200]  It's all about- What about Browning? They come in his office
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:33.320]  twice and say, we're gonna kill you and your wife.
[03:15:33.320 --> 03:15:37.680]  Yeah, basically said, people that ask questions like you, they end up dead, them and their
[03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:42.720]  wife end up dead. FBI agent saying that to him, and he said he knew that was a threat,
[03:15:42.720 --> 03:15:47.160]  it was just a blatant threat. And he said again by the water cooler too.
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:50.520]  Yeah, it's all about intimidation, and just trying to squash the information.
[03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:54.520]  I gotta be honest, I mean, somebody said that to me, I'd have a lot of trouble not punch
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:15:58.120]  them right in the nose. But that's how cowardly America's gotten.
[03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:01.160]  John has incredible courage to go public. I'm just saying everybody just grovels to
[03:16:01.160 --> 03:16:03.400]  the government. Threatened to kill me, that's wonderful.
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:07.360]  Well, and this is part of why we wanted to make State of Mind is because once the noble
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:12.500]  eye came out, we were asking why don't more people question these events? And so we really
[03:16:12.500 --> 03:16:19.220]  wanna look at the mechanism that put people into conditioning and under a level of control
[03:16:19.220 --> 03:16:24.720]  where they don't question, where they just accept authority without question.
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:29.280]  And so we really wanted to break down the methodology of how it's done, not just the-
[03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:34.160]  Well, talk about mind control. People in national security, cuz I've talked to so many of them,
[03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:38.240]  friends, family, others, they're told, you ever don't do what we say, we're gonna kill
[03:16:38.240 --> 03:16:43.640]  you. And it's this attitude of they're allowed to kill us. I mean, it's amazing.
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:48.020]  It's for the greater good. Sometimes they might have to kill Americans. And we don't
[03:16:48.020 --> 03:16:52.600]  need to know about it because the government knows best. And that whole mindset, where
[03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:57.400]  did that really solidify? In people's minds, we find that in public education, this is
[03:16:57.400 --> 03:16:58.460]  really where it starts.
[03:16:58.460 --> 03:17:02.960]  It's not about learning to think critically, using logic and reason. I mean, I had to deprogram
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:06.800]  myself after I got out of school and teach myself how to think because it was all about
[03:17:06.800 --> 03:17:13.540]  accepting authority and regurgitating useless facts. So you become a cog in the machine.
[03:17:13.540 --> 03:17:17.820]  Tell us about your experience as a whistleblower. My experience as a whistleblower started out
[03:17:17.820 --> 03:17:23.640]  being a naive corporate worker. So I'm there just trying to live up to the standards that
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:25.980]  I was brought up with through American culture.
[03:17:25.980 --> 03:17:30.280]  And then when you get into the workplace and you're surrounded by people who might not
[03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:33.320]  have the same values, cuz I come from the Midwest, we have a different set of values
[03:17:33.320 --> 03:17:36.700]  than people in New York City. When you see things that are unseemly, when you see things
[03:17:36.700 --> 03:17:39.840]  that are illegal and you blow the whistle under protection, you expect protection from
[03:17:39.840 --> 03:17:44.380]  your corporation, not a standard operating procedure to fire you, to terminate you.
[03:17:44.380 --> 03:17:49.040]  So going to court, I thought, well, I'm gonna get justification, I'm gonna present evidence.
[03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:52.580]  Going to the media, I thought maybe they would cover the story. And after proving everything
[03:17:52.580 --> 03:17:56.760]  in court and going to people like Lowell Bergman, who said, yeah, there's valid information
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:00.800]  here, but we can't cover it. And so then I just started to discover alternative media
[03:18:00.800 --> 03:18:04.140]  to go out and look beyond what I was being force fed through the Wall Street Journal
[03:18:04.140 --> 03:18:07.860]  or USA Today is what they give you at the hotel, right?
[03:18:07.860 --> 03:18:11.480]  And I started reading into things like foreign affairs where you can see, these people have
[03:18:11.480 --> 03:18:15.380]  a transnationalist agenda, they're here to collectivize America. They're here to undermine
[03:18:15.380 --> 03:18:19.460]  our education and they do it also, they reinforce it through TV and corporate media. And so
[03:18:19.460 --> 03:18:23.860]  they're breaking down the self-reliance, self-esteem, self-confidence of Americans to make us spineless.
[03:18:23.860 --> 03:18:27.760]  And that's reinforced, as you've noticed many times or observed on your show. The father
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:32.380]  figure in sitcoms, spineless individual who's being run into the ground, can't solve problems
[03:18:32.380 --> 03:18:33.380]  by themselves.
[03:18:33.380 --> 03:18:36.860]  And so by taking away the intellectual tools of how to learn anything for ourselves, they've
[03:18:36.860 --> 03:18:39.100]  made us very, very dependent on authority.
[03:18:39.100 --> 03:18:42.260]  I gotta get this guy on more often.
[03:18:42.260 --> 03:18:45.660]  Yeah, we're really lucky to get him to come on board as the head researcher and writer
[03:18:45.660 --> 03:18:46.660]  for-
[03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:49.260]  Yeah, I didn't go over your whole bio, tell folks a little bit more about yourself.
[03:18:49.260 --> 03:18:55.160]  Well, let's see, after finding out that corporate media was kind of debunked and it's on its
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:57.900]  way out cuz they no longer have investigative journalists or budgets.
[03:18:57.900 --> 03:19:02.020]  Pull that a little closer, you're good.
[03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:05.060]  Then you start to notice these press conferences actually-
[03:19:05.060 --> 03:19:07.420]  You're good, I'm aiming it right at you, it's on you now.
[03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:11.740]  And then you start to notice the contradictions. You start to pick up on the contradictions
[03:19:11.740 --> 03:19:16.140]  and you start to dig into it. And what I thought when I first was still wearing a suit at Corporate
[03:19:16.140 --> 03:19:19.660]  World every day was that, well, this will just pass.
[03:19:19.660 --> 03:19:21.860]  Skip this network, right guys, keep going.
[03:19:21.860 --> 03:19:24.580]  This is just something that you see on the Internet that has no credibility. But when
[03:19:24.580 --> 03:19:28.660]  I dug into books like Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope or the Anglo-American Establishment
[03:19:28.660 --> 03:19:30.700]  or John Taylor Gatto's The Underground History of America-
[03:19:30.700 --> 03:19:32.260]  It's just all admitted.
[03:19:32.260 --> 03:19:35.580]  Scientific Dictatorship is chapter nine in Gatto's book and it explains clearly Burch
[03:19:35.580 --> 03:19:40.100]  and Russell and these other transhumanists, transnationalists, all these different agendas
[03:19:40.100 --> 03:19:43.940]  that you cover on your show, they all have commonality. This is a finite planet, the
[03:19:43.940 --> 03:19:46.060]  globalists are a finite group of people.
[03:19:46.060 --> 03:19:50.300]  And Hastings or Jeannie Palfrey or Gary Webb or any of these other investigative journalists
[03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:55.540]  or people who have had stories that needed coverage, they have to come here. Because
[03:19:55.540 --> 03:19:59.620]  luckily we have a place someplace on this planet that does have the budget to get these
[03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:03.200]  big interviews. I don't have the ability to do this myself. I couldn't interview Sergeant
[03:20:03.200 --> 03:20:05.020]  Joe Biggs today and break that story.
[03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:09.260]  So I'm grateful that there are people out there that are aiding you and assisting you
[03:20:09.260 --> 03:20:11.780]  cuz I've seen you struggle over the years.
[03:20:11.780 --> 03:20:12.780]  And-
[03:20:12.780 --> 03:20:16.660]  Well, I'm trying to get other, that's why I try to support other media outlets, show
[03:20:16.660 --> 03:20:20.580]  that we're not one of the only ones doing it. Because I just wanna win this thing. It's
[03:20:20.580 --> 03:20:24.540]  not about being a big media guy. I mean, if I'm successful, they'll probably take me out
[03:20:24.540 --> 03:20:27.460]  somehow, if not physically, politically.
[03:20:27.460 --> 03:20:32.140]  So my mission is almost like a mushroom to get my spores out there so that there's a
[03:20:32.140 --> 03:20:36.540]  million mushrooms so they can never wipe us all out. That's why I've got the reporters.
[03:20:36.540 --> 03:20:40.980]  That's why I'm trying to build an organization so even if they get me, it continues. Because
[03:20:40.980 --> 03:20:42.940]  then that makes killing me obsolete.
[03:20:42.940 --> 03:20:45.140]  I mean, these are the type of thoughts we have to have around here.
[03:20:45.140 --> 03:20:48.380]  Well, it's worked because I mean, this was the inspiration for me to start Free Mind
[03:20:48.380 --> 03:20:52.860]  Films was I wanted to be able to participate in this and create tools. Because we have
[03:20:52.860 --> 03:20:56.820]  our roots in street activism. So I wanna be able to give people tools that they can take
[03:20:56.820 --> 03:21:02.700]  to their friends and family, the uninitiated, and present it in a way where it's acceptable
[03:21:02.700 --> 03:21:04.940]  to them.
[03:21:04.940 --> 03:21:10.100]  It's not just for the choir. We want this to show to the uninitiated where you can really
[03:21:10.100 --> 03:21:15.540]  give them a foundational understanding of the control and then maybe be able to escape
[03:21:15.540 --> 03:21:19.340]  it. And then just start looking at the bigger pictures.
[03:21:19.340 --> 03:21:22.300]  State of mind is kind of a starting point. So it gives you the tools to communicate with
[03:21:22.300 --> 03:21:26.380]  your friends and family and co-workers in a credible and desirable way. And it also
[03:21:26.380 --> 03:21:31.580]  is backed by a lot of research where we're able to bring you in depth. So for the choir,
[03:21:31.580 --> 03:21:35.020]  there's something else. And for the congregation, it's something meaty.
[03:21:35.020 --> 03:21:39.380]  So you have this additional information that is available if you wanna dig in past the
[03:21:39.380 --> 03:21:44.620]  film and see about any of these underlying agendas of MK Ultra or Eugenics or any of
[03:21:44.620 --> 03:21:47.980]  these other things that are covered in its depth and entirety with references.
[03:21:47.980 --> 03:21:49.900]  Tell folks who all is in the film.
[03:21:49.900 --> 03:21:55.760]  Well, we have Jira Griffin, we have Anthony Shaffer. He was specifically talking about
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:22:02.780]  some of the psyops. Kind of breaking those down with his experience in the military intelligence.
[03:22:02.780 --> 03:22:11.980]  We've got several psychologists. We've got Colin Ross. We've got John Rappaport.
[03:22:11.980 --> 03:22:12.980]  Bruce Levine.
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:17.260]  Bruce Levine. Bruce Levine, I actually found him through one of the shows that you did
[03:22:17.260 --> 03:22:23.600]  on President Planet. And the guy really comes up with solutions. It's not just pointing
[03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:25.340]  it out, he comes up with ideas.
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:27.660]  He's a great psychologist.
[03:22:27.660 --> 03:22:33.220]  And get up, stand up, I think was his book. It was very inspirational. We've got Charlotte
[03:22:33.220 --> 03:22:42.220]  Iserbyt, Kay Beach, great activists, yourself. So really good lineup of people, real broad
[03:22:42.220 --> 03:22:46.240]  spectrum and to get the psychologists in there, man, they've got a way of just getting right
[03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:48.140]  to the heart of the matter.
[03:22:48.140 --> 03:22:56.220]  Maybe it's pharmacological control of society or coming up with disorders like anti-authoritarian
[03:22:56.220 --> 03:22:59.060]  personality disorder, these types of things.
[03:22:59.060 --> 03:23:01.420]  Which should be, doesn't want to be a slave disorder.
[03:23:01.420 --> 03:23:06.500]  Yeah, yeah. And so we were really pleased with the lineup. I think these folks really
[03:23:06.500 --> 03:23:07.500]  get the message across.
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:12.300]  Well, the film is available at infowarstore.com. State of mind, the psychology of control and
[03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:16.540]  it's so important to get the film so that you're informed to a higher level so you can
[03:23:16.540 --> 03:23:19.940]  wake up your friends and family, but also to support these filmmakers and what we're
[03:23:19.940 --> 03:23:20.940]  doing.
[03:23:20.940 --> 03:23:24.460]  You vote with your dollars. We're not like MSNBC and others that get taxpayer funds.
[03:23:24.460 --> 03:23:28.100]  We don't get Rockefeller Foundation funds. We are supported by viewers and listeners
[03:23:28.100 --> 03:23:29.460]  out there like you.
[03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:35.500]  And we also have it on Blu-ray cuz I said, hey, we're gonna put this out on DVD. I paid
[03:23:35.500 --> 03:23:41.600]  to put some Blu-rays out as well cuz Obama Deception 2 is gonna be out on Blu-ray. The
[03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:46.140]  whole issue here is it's good to have a hard copy of things like this as well.
[03:23:46.140 --> 03:23:52.220]  We will premiere it on Infowars Nightly News of the 17th. As it's already being shipped
[03:23:52.220 --> 03:23:55.820]  out to everybody that buys a hard copy, then obviously that will be available to people
[03:23:55.820 --> 03:24:01.020]  out of the gates. A film for everybody to be able to see free after it's been on prisonbonda.tv.
[03:24:01.020 --> 03:24:06.360]  You have to understand something. That's because they wanna get the information out to people.
[03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:11.860]  And if they don't sell enough to make their money back, there won't be any more films.
[03:24:11.860 --> 03:24:18.300]  So we're right at the level at current sales that may be within three, four months because
[03:24:18.300 --> 03:24:22.820]  that's really the main life of a film that tapers off to try to even make their money
[03:24:22.820 --> 03:24:23.820]  back.
[03:24:23.820 --> 03:24:26.860]  So for heaven's sakes, folks, we're up here risking our lives. You guys definitely risk
[03:24:26.860 --> 03:24:31.260]  your lives in the Oklahoma City film. They killed a lot of people over that. So we're
[03:24:31.260 --> 03:24:34.700]  here risking our lives. You need to buy the film. And people out there should buy five
[03:24:34.700 --> 03:24:36.580]  copies and give it to friends and family.
[03:24:36.580 --> 03:24:42.500]  People should get prisonbonda.tv memberships. And you should, after it premieres live that
[03:24:42.500 --> 03:24:47.900]  night during the live show, then we're gonna go to tape and play the film. You should use
[03:24:47.900 --> 03:24:51.860]  your prisonbonda.tv membership the next day when you have the high quality download of
[03:24:51.860 --> 03:24:57.420]  it off the site to have your friends and family come over, maybe the 18th, or watch it live
[03:24:57.420 --> 03:24:59.340]  stream that night.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:06.540]  The whole point is that it's now time to go out and proselytize for liberty to other people.
[03:25:06.540 --> 03:25:11.940]  I want us to beat this evil. And we've got to become aware of the evil if we have any
[03:25:11.940 --> 03:25:15.820]  chance of doing it. And what do you guys think is happening? Because you're both really smart
[03:25:15.820 --> 03:25:18.660]  guys. I've heard your radio shows over the years. Well, I feel like I know you so good,
[03:25:18.660 --> 03:25:22.260]  even though we've only met a few times in the past when you were making films.
[03:25:22.260 --> 03:25:26.880]  Why do you think they're racing ahead right now? And why do you think the agenda is coming
[03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:31.580]  out in the open? Because people are spinning and saying, Snowden must be an agent and blah,
[03:25:31.580 --> 03:25:35.580]  blah, blah. But I've experienced every time I do something, I know I'm not an agent. I
[03:25:35.580 --> 03:25:43.660]  know I'm real. And they say, he must be an insider because of the fact that he's been
[03:25:43.660 --> 03:25:44.660]  successful.
[03:25:44.660 --> 03:25:47.980]  It's almost like this idea that no one can be successful but evil people when that's
[03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:53.420]  not true. That's what's so frustrating. So what do you think's happening in the state
[03:25:53.420 --> 03:25:54.980]  of the battle right now?
[03:25:54.980 --> 03:25:59.540]  We were talking about this just before the show. It's like trying to hold a ball underwater.
[03:25:59.540 --> 03:26:01.460]  It's natural status to pop out and they have to exert-
[03:26:01.460 --> 03:26:02.460]  We're inflating the ball.
[03:26:02.460 --> 03:26:06.460]  They are exerting so much control to keep it underwater. And these types of efforts,
[03:26:06.460 --> 03:26:07.780]  yes, inflate the ball.
[03:26:07.780 --> 03:26:11.380]  Brzezinski said his greatest fear is a massive global awakening of consciousness. And that's
[03:26:11.380 --> 03:26:14.500]  what they're seeing right now. They're seeing the internet used and social networks used
[03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:18.460]  in a way that they never imagined. They wanted to data mine us, to use artificial intelligence
[03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:22.520]  to chew on that data mining to provide profiles to predict our behavior and control us like
[03:26:22.520 --> 03:26:23.520]  human resources.
[03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:24.660]  And now they're predicting their defeat.
[03:26:24.660 --> 03:26:28.280]  Yeah, absolutely. And so people are waking up faster and faster and the massive global
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:31.660]  awakening of consciousness is stimulated by independent media. We are the ones waking
[03:26:31.660 --> 03:26:35.060]  people up, everyone who does something on their own without being told by an authority
[03:26:35.060 --> 03:26:38.060]  to do it, or a big corporation paying you to do it.
[03:26:38.060 --> 03:26:41.860]  Thinking on our own, using our creativity and imagination, that which corporate society
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:46.700]  and education wants to snuff out by reigniting those flames of liberty. Then evil doesn't
[03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:50.100]  have to happen because good people do nothing. Good people know how to do something and get
[03:26:50.100 --> 03:26:51.420]  it done.
[03:26:51.420 --> 03:26:55.300]  And all it takes is to get involved. Just one step leads to the next. I mean, a lot
[03:26:55.300 --> 03:26:58.780]  of this starts out with just local activism or like you said, take the bumper stickers,
[03:26:58.780 --> 03:27:01.100]  put them in a car, give the magazine-
[03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:06.240]  Big things have small beginnings. What did you make of Staff Sergeant Big Sean saying,
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:10.900]  I've just got to stand up. I can't be a coward. My gut tells me this is bad. It doesn't add
[03:27:10.900 --> 03:27:16.700]  up and now others will stand up and then they'll crush people. What I found is when they crush
[03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:20.940]  whistleblowers, it scares the cowards, they're already cowards, but it makes the real men
[03:27:20.940 --> 03:27:22.580]  and women actually fight harder.
[03:27:22.580 --> 03:27:26.340]  I see them having to kill a bunch of people as the beginning of the end.
[03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:31.500]  The end of the last desperate act. I mean, I think that we see that we're getting closer
[03:27:31.500 --> 03:27:34.860]  to critical mass. I mean, everything's out in the open. I mean, some of the t-shirts
[03:27:34.860 --> 03:27:39.420]  I'm wearing and stuff. Random people will come out and start talking about the NSA,
[03:27:39.420 --> 03:27:42.300]  come out saying that they're monitoring everybody.
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:46.940]  I was like, well, everybody was talking about this in 96, 97 with Echelon and Carnivore.
[03:27:46.940 --> 03:27:51.300]  And I was like, well, now it's just out in the open. So much has come out. And again,
[03:27:51.300 --> 03:27:54.980]  you said social media, we're taking their tools and using them again.
[03:27:54.980 --> 03:27:58.460]  Everybody remembers that they made fun of us and said we were crazy liars. And then
[03:27:58.460 --> 03:28:03.420]  exactly what we told them came true because it was already there. It didn't come true.
[03:28:03.420 --> 03:28:04.940]  They just took the blinders off.
[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:05.940]  It was what?
[03:28:05.940 --> 03:28:06.940]  And we're not profits.
[03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:09.620]  But they have business plans. And if you read these business plans, you can understand their
[03:28:09.620 --> 03:28:10.620]  agenda.
[03:28:10.620 --> 03:28:11.620]  No, that's it. They have business plans.
[03:28:11.620 --> 03:28:14.540]  Exactly. And they're intellectually bankrupt. They're irrational. They use force, fraud
[03:28:14.540 --> 03:28:16.280]  and coercion to attain their goals.
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:20.780]  That's another thing. I've studied these elitists. They have almost unhappy families. Their kids
[03:28:20.780 --> 03:28:25.740]  are all committing suicide. I mean, it's not good for them either. I mean, it's not good
[03:28:25.740 --> 03:28:28.860]  to screw everybody over. It's going to come back on you.
[03:28:28.860 --> 03:28:34.380]  Yeah, well, I mean, they're pure ego. They're pure just will. And that's why I think there's
[03:28:34.380 --> 03:28:36.580]  so much infighting within their own ranks.
[03:28:36.580 --> 03:28:37.580]  Thank God.
[03:28:37.580 --> 03:28:38.580]  Yes.
[03:28:38.580 --> 03:28:43.180]  Well, one of the other things we've lost in this country is integrity as a core value.
[03:28:43.180 --> 03:28:45.260]  People in this country say they value truth. The people who-
[03:28:45.260 --> 03:28:47.940]  My most valuable possession is my integrity.
[03:28:47.940 --> 03:28:48.940]  Right.
[03:28:48.940 --> 03:28:52.540]  And they really enjoy. It's not just like I'm a goody two-shoes. I feel good knowing
[03:28:52.540 --> 03:28:56.140]  that I really am a good guy. That's why they always try to say I'm not good, because the
[03:28:56.140 --> 03:28:59.980]  system knows they know that. They don't want you to think there's other good people.
[03:28:59.980 --> 03:29:02.820]  Well, integrity is doing what you said you were going to do when you said you were going
[03:29:02.820 --> 03:29:06.300]  to do it. And it's about that consistency that your friends and family can trust you
[03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:10.260]  and coworkers. And so our whole society is based on trust. And JP Morgan said at one
[03:29:10.260 --> 03:29:14.220]  point, the entire banking system is made on trust. And they've broken that trust. They've
[03:29:14.220 --> 03:29:17.500]  broken that trust. They've abused their system. And that's what's causing people to wake up.
[03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:20.020]  And they're not going to go back to sleep, because there's only more and more and more
[03:29:20.020 --> 03:29:21.260]  substance to find.
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:25.820]  Wow. Man, awesome. Let's come back and do another segment or two. Great job with the
[03:29:25.820 --> 03:29:29.820]  crew in there and all the listeners. And then you're going to be on the news tonight, back
[03:29:29.820 --> 03:29:32.500]  for an hour tomorrow to get into the film itself. We're going to play some video clips
[03:29:32.500 --> 03:29:35.820]  tomorrow. And I want to ask you when you come back, though, I mean, what did you make of
[03:29:35.820 --> 03:29:38.140]  that big interview? You were out there listening. What did you think of that?
[03:29:38.140 --> 03:29:41.660]  It was fantastic. I mean, it's really great that somebody today can see that there's something
[03:29:41.660 --> 03:29:45.620]  going on and have the urge and the motivation to make a phone call and spread that information.
[03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:50.060]  And go against the mind control. All the peer pressure. Exactly. And to have an outlet like
[03:29:50.060 --> 03:29:54.780]  what you have. We're on the march. Absolutely. We'll be right back. The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.780 --> 03:29:57.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:33:08.020 --> 03:33:13.940]  Alex Jones here back live. By the way, here's a Herald Sun article. Hastings previously
[03:33:13.940 --> 03:33:18.600]  revealed he'd been subjected to death threats during his investigation of General McChrystal
[03:33:18.600 --> 03:33:24.220]  saying it was commonplace in his line of work. Wherever I'd been reporting around groups
[03:33:24.220 --> 03:33:28.080]  of dudes whose job it was to kill people, one of them would usually mention that they
[03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:36.620]  were going to kill me. And it's not a joke, ladies and gentlemen. We have a degenerate
[03:33:36.620 --> 03:33:43.560]  ruling class of corporate anti-liberty fascists using disgusting socialism at the grassroots
[03:33:43.560 --> 03:33:49.220]  to create a bunch of sycophantic lazy dolts to be used as political weapons to pull down
[03:33:49.220 --> 03:33:50.220]  society.
[03:33:50.220 --> 03:33:56.260]  I mean, every message you see out there is anti-family, anti-this, anti-that. And all
[03:33:56.260 --> 03:34:00.220]  the fake equality moves you see promoted are not about real equality. It's about the federal
[03:34:00.220 --> 03:34:06.220]  government manipulating groups of people against each other. And it is unbelievable. But there's
[03:34:06.220 --> 03:34:12.360]  the Herald Sun. And I'd forgotten, cuz I remember reading this about a year ago, that he was
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:14.660]  being death-threaded.
[03:34:14.660 --> 03:34:18.860]  And then his buddy mentioned it, and then it was the weirdest thing. I wasn't even searching
[03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:23.520]  it. I already had an article up there about reporter Michael Hastings, sent panicky email.
[03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:28.940]  And then I just looked as he was talking to me, and there was the Herald Sun with it saying
[03:34:28.940 --> 03:34:34.060]  it. While he's talking about it, I'd seen that nowhere in the news in the article I
[03:34:34.060 --> 03:34:37.740]  had up, said it from two days ago.
[03:34:37.740 --> 03:34:42.220]  I mean, it's hiding in plain view. And his wife comes out and says, we're gonna find
[03:34:42.220 --> 03:34:47.860]  out who did this. We're gonna take down whoever did this. And I'm telling, he said off air
[03:34:47.860 --> 03:34:52.140]  to me that she was busy, should have got this on air, in grief right now. He may have said
[03:34:52.140 --> 03:34:53.900]  it on air, it all mixes together.
[03:34:53.900 --> 03:35:00.340]  But she better either decide to pack it up and shut up, and that's still a dangerous
[03:35:00.340 --> 03:35:08.280]  course. Or go totally public now, that's probably the safest course. I mean, it's not very safe
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:12.880]  to just say I'm gonna shut up cuz they know that she may go public later. And look, they'll
[03:35:12.880 --> 03:35:13.880]  kill her.
[03:35:13.880 --> 03:35:17.580]  I mean, they'll kill everybody. Because I've been talking about this for two weeks since
[03:35:17.580 --> 03:35:21.620]  it came out in the New York Times. It just reminded me that hundreds of thousands of
[03:35:21.620 --> 03:35:25.060]  US troops got nerve gassed, even USA Today admitted it. Our government ordered the stuff
[03:35:25.060 --> 03:35:28.840]  blown up, knew the wind was blowing right into Kuwait, let them huff it, said take your
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:29.840]  mask off.
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:33.740]  Just like the World Trade Center collapsed, cuz they didn't wanna admit it was hurting
[03:35:33.740 --> 03:35:38.560]  them when the detectors went off. Just take your mask off as a sign of, see, it's safe.
[03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:42.460]  By the way, we're gonna helicopter out of here as the generals real fast.
[03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:47.900]  Knowing it was a slow death death sentence, did they cross anybody? No, it's like they
[03:35:47.900 --> 03:35:54.820]  get off on hurting people. What do you think that psychology is? Because they use psychology
[03:35:54.820 --> 03:35:58.180]  on us, but they're the ones that are really screwed up.
[03:35:58.180 --> 03:36:05.380]  Well, I mean, there are a lot of the hallmarks of psychopaths. I mean, and it's, psychopaths
[03:36:05.380 --> 03:36:10.540]  are genetic and environmental. And they're told from birth that they're, through social
[03:36:10.540 --> 03:36:16.620]  Darwinism, that they're superior to all the rest of us. And yeah, it's like Orwell talking
[03:36:16.620 --> 03:36:21.620]  about, it's the thrill of victory over helpless victim.
[03:36:21.620 --> 03:36:23.300]  Trampling and being traveled forever.
[03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:27.220]  Yeah, and that's one of the things that Dr. Bruce Levine talks about in State of Mind,
[03:36:27.220 --> 03:36:32.980]  is learned helplessness. And I think this is what people have to overcome in order to
[03:36:32.980 --> 03:36:37.460]  really get engaged and get involved. And after so many times of thinking that they can't
[03:36:37.460 --> 03:36:42.040]  do anything, that they are powerless, then they just stop trying.
[03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:44.420]  And it's just getting up, getting that motivation to try-
[03:36:44.420 --> 03:36:45.660]  Stop giving up.
[03:36:45.660 --> 03:36:51.380]  And this big man, he's not gonna roll over. He doesn't have the learned helplessness.
[03:36:51.380 --> 03:36:55.540]  He says he's gonna get involved and do something. And more brave people like that need to step
[03:36:55.540 --> 03:36:57.660]  up and that's where we hit the critical mass.
[03:36:57.660 --> 03:37:01.580]  Well, he made the decision on air. He said, I'm gonna do more. I'm gonna go full into
[03:37:01.580 --> 03:37:06.060]  this. And I could hear him doing that and I didn't tell him who I thought was behind
[03:37:06.060 --> 03:37:11.700]  it and stuff off air to scare him. I wanted him to know and so he understands, okay, listen,
[03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:13.980]  you're not imagining this, bud.
[03:37:13.980 --> 03:37:15.860]  You're common sense. They killed your buddy.
[03:37:15.860 --> 03:37:19.920]  And if you're gonna come out, come out big. Because then more people will be aware if
[03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:20.920]  they actually-
[03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:23.780]  That's what Garrison said. Jim Garrison.
[03:37:23.780 --> 03:37:27.040]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer says in his extended interview, I think it got cut
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:30.900]  from the film, but he says at one point, he explains very clearly that the Pentagon's
[03:37:30.900 --> 03:37:36.740]  rules for information warfare include assassinations. And so he explains that if there's a political
[03:37:36.740 --> 03:37:40.280]  figure, if there's an activist figure, if there's a whistleblower figure, that falls
[03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:44.080]  under the realm of info war, of psychological warfare and info war, the carrying out of
[03:37:44.080 --> 03:37:46.180]  assassinations on activists.
[03:37:46.180 --> 03:37:50.860]  So you're looking at intraspecific kleptoparasites. These are people of the same species who are
[03:37:50.860 --> 03:37:54.060]  preying on us. They prey on our, we produce.
[03:37:54.060 --> 03:37:55.060]  They-
[03:37:55.060 --> 03:37:56.060]  Say that again.
[03:37:56.060 --> 03:37:57.060]  Intraspecific kleptoparasites.
[03:37:57.060 --> 03:37:58.620]  Did you coin that?
[03:37:58.620 --> 03:38:04.340]  No, it's a 1952 paper by Miriam Rothschild. So they study animals. There's a whole bunch
[03:38:04.340 --> 03:38:08.600]  of Rothschild species, they use their money to study animals and human beings to understand
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:12.580]  us and control us. So there's Rothschild giraffes, butterflies, all these different things. So
[03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:13.580]  they find-
[03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:14.780]  No, I knew they named a lot of animals after themselves.
[03:38:14.780 --> 03:38:18.700]  Right, so they came up with this term for, it was gulls that they were studying at the
[03:38:18.700 --> 03:38:22.540]  time. But they're saying, of the same species preying on each other, and that's-
[03:38:22.540 --> 03:38:26.620]  Sure, well, that's what I've said is, that's what it is. It is predator guilds above us.
[03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:30.940]  We are not the apex predator. The psychopath inbred guild is the apex predator.
[03:38:30.940 --> 03:38:34.380]  Well, and they've built protection systems over time. So these are multi-generational
[03:38:34.380 --> 03:38:41.340]  guilds of psychopaths, of sociopaths, of people who don't care about anyone else's free rights
[03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:42.340]  or free will.
[03:38:42.340 --> 03:38:43.340]  Well, they enjoy actually.
[03:38:43.340 --> 03:38:45.180]  Yeah, they get off on taking the power.
[03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:49.200]  I mean, look at the BBC with their child raping guild. I mean, it's, you know.
[03:38:49.200 --> 03:38:52.080]  And they need people's fear to control them, cuz fear shuts down your mind. It makes you
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:56.980]  stimulus response. Stimulus response is slavery. Stimulus thinking response is freedom. We
[03:38:56.980 --> 03:38:59.420]  have to put that thinking back in between stimulus and response.
[03:38:59.420 --> 03:39:05.420]  What would you call the instinct just to absolutely have to resist this? That's my, I mean, I'm
[03:39:05.420 --> 03:39:09.780]  trying to stop species death. My whole instinct is defend humanity, stop these people.
[03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:13.580]  I think that's just being human, man. I think that's just the human response to this abnormal
[03:39:13.580 --> 03:39:16.580]  situation that has gotten out of hand because we've been lied to for so long.
[03:39:16.580 --> 03:39:17.580]  But now we're-
[03:39:17.580 --> 03:39:21.620]  And what happens is good people are just as mean or even meaner than these mean people.
[03:39:21.620 --> 03:39:26.100]  We just don't get in that mode. They know once we get in the mode, they're done. Once
[03:39:26.100 --> 03:39:27.820]  we get in the mode, it's over for them.
[03:39:27.820 --> 03:39:31.180]  Right, and we have to be serious about this, cuz there's no do-overs. There's no mulligans,
[03:39:31.180 --> 03:39:35.700]  right? And so we all have to work together. We have to unite all the forces and get together
[03:39:35.700 --> 03:39:36.700]  on common ground.
[03:39:36.700 --> 03:39:40.860]  We have commonality with every other human being on this planet insofar as we want our
[03:39:40.860 --> 03:39:44.020]  right to live. We want our right to property so that we can preserve our life and these
[03:39:44.020 --> 03:39:47.160]  sort of things. And this other group just wants to take that away. And there's a long
[03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:51.060]  credible history to it. And it's sad that American children are being denied that education
[03:39:51.060 --> 03:39:52.060]  in school.
[03:39:52.060 --> 03:39:56.300]  Well, they admit it's a multi-thousand year war against humanity. And that's why they
[03:39:56.300 --> 03:40:02.060]  call it the final revolution, finally breaking us where we can never defeat them again.
[03:40:02.060 --> 03:40:07.060]  Well, and it's very obvious to all the listeners that it's moving towards a collectivist plan.
[03:40:07.060 --> 03:40:11.460]  I mean, that's the obvious goal. But now you're trying to get a lot of individualists to act
[03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:17.220]  in a collective manner. And it is difficult sometimes. But it's just because maybe this
[03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:20.880]  activist path is different than the other. That doesn't mean that we're not all heading
[03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:21.880]  to the same destination.
[03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:24.340]  All roads lead to the end of the New World Order.
[03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:25.340]  Exactly.
[03:40:25.340 --> 03:40:27.660]  And in fact, the fact that we're going in so many different directions is why they can't
[03:40:27.660 --> 03:40:32.380]  stop us. That's when my goal is just to generate as many resistance operations.
[03:40:32.380 --> 03:40:35.820]  So the fact that we're becoming autonomous because we're thinking for ourselves and directing
[03:40:35.820 --> 03:40:39.000]  ourselves and nobody's telling us to go out and do this. American schooling is based on
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:43.860]  a Prussian schooling model, which as you very well know, leaves people to be obedient servants,
[03:40:43.860 --> 03:40:47.300]  not self thinkers that are critically thinking about their life.
[03:40:47.300 --> 03:40:51.500]  The most important thing I do now is everywhere in public, even my wife or kids are there,
[03:40:51.500 --> 03:40:56.100]  I just start talking about the New World Order and I make a big scene. And in a nice way,
[03:40:56.100 --> 03:41:01.020]  when somebody tries to peck at me in a bureaucratic way, I just go, okay, let's get it out in
[03:41:01.020 --> 03:41:03.360]  the open here.
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:07.060]  This goes two ways, I'm about to inform you. And they always go, I actually know that's
[03:41:07.060 --> 03:41:10.380]  true. I go, you know you're a slave, you know the system's after you, you know you're acting
[03:41:10.380 --> 03:41:15.020]  pathetic on a power trip, imagining you're in charge. Tune into your real humanity right
[03:41:15.020 --> 03:41:18.340]  now and stop acting like that, and it almost always breaks their trance.
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:23.020]  Well, and they've wrote books about this through history, like 1939, H.G. Wells' New World
[03:41:23.020 --> 03:41:27.020]  Order. He very clearly in there says that they wanted to create a world government and
[03:41:27.020 --> 03:41:31.100]  create a new religion. That new religion is non-critical thinking. It's stimulus response,
[03:41:31.100 --> 03:41:32.660]  operant conditioning is the religion-
[03:41:32.660 --> 03:41:33.660]  It's robot.
[03:41:33.660 --> 03:41:34.660]  Robot, exactly.
[03:41:34.660 --> 03:41:38.100]  Yeah, I'm just turning people into a cogs in a machine.
[03:41:38.100 --> 03:41:40.540]  What was it like for you as you began to discover this stuff?
[03:41:40.540 --> 03:41:44.380]  It was pretty scary because everyone was just like, drop it and go back to work, go find
[03:41:44.380 --> 03:41:49.100]  another job. Just get along, go along to get along, don't worry about this. And people
[03:41:49.100 --> 03:41:52.620]  were saying, look, it doesn't really matter if there's a backdoor in the Sarbanes-Oxley
[03:41:52.620 --> 03:41:56.980]  software that's federally mandated to protect from another Enron or Tyco.
[03:41:56.980 --> 03:42:01.300]  And Tyco was one of my clients and they said, we don't wanna keep this data like the regulations
[03:42:01.300 --> 03:42:05.060]  say, we wanna use the backdoor so we can hide all this stuff. So what you see with the financial
[03:42:05.060 --> 03:42:10.340]  collapse and all this NSA spying is, they've kept every piece of information except the
[03:42:10.340 --> 03:42:14.220]  evidence to catch the people who stole the quadrillions of dollars-
[03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:18.460]  Well, no, it's just like the electronic voting machine software always is designed to let
[03:42:18.460 --> 03:42:21.020]  the hacker in and then close it and cover it up.
[03:42:21.020 --> 03:42:22.020]  Right.
[03:42:22.020 --> 03:42:23.300]  It's a system designed for crime.
[03:42:23.300 --> 03:42:24.300]  Right.
[03:42:24.300 --> 03:42:25.420]  I mean, unbelievable.
[03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:30.220]  It's a prophylactic product, but that prophylactic has a hole in it, purposely, because they're
[03:42:30.220 --> 03:42:33.620]  trying to get America pregnant with this criminal syndicate.
[03:42:33.620 --> 03:42:38.780]  Well, what they do is they always create trap doors for them, but that we don't know about.
[03:42:38.780 --> 03:42:39.780]  Right.
[03:42:39.780 --> 03:42:44.180]  Like all the rich people, they don't pay any taxes. They don't give tips. These globalists
[03:42:44.180 --> 03:42:46.980]  are all the same. That's why people always hate the Bilderberg so bad. They'll go and
[03:42:46.980 --> 03:42:52.100]  have like $500 apiece dinners and then not even pay for it and taxpayers pay.
[03:42:52.100 --> 03:42:56.180]  And then no tip and then say, I want this man fired. He looked me in the eyes. I mean,
[03:42:56.180 --> 03:43:00.500]  can you imagine controlling trillions of dollars, having hundreds of billions in your account?
[03:43:00.500 --> 03:43:05.780]  And you enjoy the fact that the waiter can't pay their bills. You enjoy they're not doing
[03:43:05.780 --> 03:43:06.780]  good. You enjoy.
[03:43:06.780 --> 03:43:11.140]  I mean, can you imagine that? Well, in the corporate world, you know, like I said, when
[03:43:11.140 --> 03:43:15.060]  you find out about this stuff, it seems incredible or like it's not credible. But then you find
[03:43:15.060 --> 03:43:20.540]  a book like David Rothkopf's Superclass. He's a member of the CFR and the Carnegie Institute.
[03:43:20.540 --> 03:43:23.920]  So he's telling you there's 6000 individuals around the world who act as a superclass to
[03:43:23.920 --> 03:43:28.820]  whom laws don't really apply. And they control what we think is voted on with, you know,
[03:43:28.820 --> 03:43:33.140]  Chuck Rothkopf told me off air when he was head of the Kissinger group, he said, why
[03:43:33.140 --> 03:43:34.540]  John Armand was running the show and heard it.
[03:43:34.540 --> 03:43:37.740]  He goes, I came on. I know who you are, Alex. I came on because you need to join us. You
[03:43:37.740 --> 03:43:43.300]  need to be part of this. I'm just like that. They always it's always the same believers.
[03:43:43.300 --> 03:43:47.100]  Well, they told me you see it. You need to be part of it. The public will tear you into
[03:43:47.100 --> 03:43:48.100]  pieces.
[03:43:48.100 --> 03:43:50.460]  Well, and I think a lot of that plays into the learned helplessness whenever they're
[03:43:50.460 --> 03:43:56.460]  too big to jail and they know somebody else goes and steals a hundred couple hundred dollar
[03:43:56.460 --> 03:44:01.400]  TV or whatever, they're in prison. These guys are still trillions and not anything happens
[03:44:01.400 --> 03:44:03.620]  to them. That plays into the learned helplessness.
[03:44:03.620 --> 03:44:04.620]  It's just that's more.
[03:44:04.620 --> 03:44:10.880]  No, it's like a pimp in that famous HBO piece. You know, she's been beat up, run over. She's
[03:44:10.880 --> 03:44:18.020]  got broken bones, disfigured. And the pimp's going, you know, HBO goes, what do you pay
[03:44:18.020 --> 03:44:22.300]  her? And he goes, nothing. He goes, she's lucky if she eats once a day. She's lucky
[03:44:22.300 --> 03:44:23.820]  about getting her fried chicken.
[03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:27.580]  And the mother goes, how did you do this to my baby? And the woman's groveling to the
[03:44:27.580 --> 03:44:33.380]  pimp. And that's what TSA, all of it is, is just worshipping that we're scum and filth
[03:44:33.380 --> 03:44:38.460]  and the cops can kill us whenever they want, taser us whenever they want. It is just, they
[03:44:38.460 --> 03:44:39.500]  are breaking our will.
[03:44:39.500 --> 03:44:42.920]  And the mind control of the pimp over the prostitute is no different than the person
[03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:47.700]  who owned a gladiator back in the day. A man's small and saturated could use fear and words
[03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:51.380]  and mind control a bigger man and get him to fight for entertainment. So what you have
[03:44:51.380 --> 03:44:55.500]  is the New World Order, the difference between them and us is that they don't have faith
[03:44:55.500 --> 03:44:56.500]  in the public.
[03:44:56.500 --> 03:44:59.740]  They think we're animals and we have faith in the public. We know people can adapt, evolve
[03:44:59.740 --> 03:45:03.740]  and overcome. They can learn, they can reignite their curiosity and start to take it upon
[03:45:03.740 --> 03:45:07.100]  themselves not to be a victim in this system that makes everyone a victim until you know
[03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:08.100]  what's going on.
[03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:12.980]  Well, I just think it's important to get crazed again like an original human and just get
[03:45:12.980 --> 03:45:18.700]  angry. We have the instincts, the programming to crush psychos. They need to be crushed.
[03:45:18.700 --> 03:45:23.740]  I mean, that's what got me motivated was just the anger over it. You know, it's like that
[03:45:23.740 --> 03:45:27.980]  after that, you can't stop. You know, it's like, again, just that first step and you
[03:45:27.980 --> 03:45:31.900]  get you get the motivation, get moving forward and getting angry at first is part of it.
[03:45:31.900 --> 03:45:35.540]  You know, that's how you start thinking. I'm a free human being. I mean, it's like, what
[03:45:35.540 --> 03:45:40.780]  is it like drawing the blood to hear in checkpoints? It's like what if I don't I don't even own
[03:45:40.780 --> 03:45:45.740]  my blood, you know, they're just normalizing the tyranny and the general public's like
[03:45:45.740 --> 03:45:47.740]  the broken whore going, but he's my baby.
[03:45:47.740 --> 03:45:53.740]  You know, he's taking care of me when he beats me with a coat hanger. I mean, it's just incredible.
[03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:57.660]  And the anger is when you break out of the trance. It's the outrage is the transfer from
[03:45:57.660 --> 03:46:01.640]  the anger to outrage where you actually start thinking and dissecting and paying attention
[03:46:01.640 --> 03:46:03.300]  and focusing on what they're doing.
[03:46:03.300 --> 03:46:07.440]  I think that's the step that people need to go. And then it's the resistance at any opportunity
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:11.740]  of the targeting just every level. You're going to bring them down. You're now in a
[03:46:11.740 --> 03:46:16.780]  war with them. And it gives your life meaning because survival is victory. And we've always
[03:46:16.780 --> 03:46:18.340]  been fighting for survival.
[03:46:18.340 --> 03:46:23.020]  This is what humans are meant to do. And we are under the scientific technocracy, the
[03:46:23.020 --> 03:46:27.700]  scientific dictatorship they're trying to complete. And the messages we've transmitted
[03:46:27.700 --> 03:46:32.700]  are going to grow in power against them as their program rolls out. This is going to
[03:46:32.700 --> 03:46:38.660]  echo forever. We don't know what chain reaction we're engaging in right now that will sever
[03:46:38.660 --> 03:46:39.660]  their control.
[03:46:39.660 --> 03:46:43.940]  Yeah. And then after you start to develop a love for humanity, then, you know, that's
[03:46:43.940 --> 03:46:48.820]  that's really where you you broke free, you know, as you remove your conditioning, you
[03:46:48.820 --> 03:46:53.900]  know, again, start to learn reason, logic, how to think, you know, and commit. I mean,
[03:46:53.900 --> 03:46:55.740]  what about the feeling of commitment?
[03:46:55.740 --> 03:47:00.220]  But I think the love for humanity, that's what that's what drives, you know, so many
[03:47:00.220 --> 03:47:02.700]  of us, I think, to continue to do what we do and risk it.
[03:47:02.700 --> 03:47:05.780]  I think you commit to think or not to think, and you have to make that choice. You're either
[03:47:05.780 --> 03:47:09.020]  going to be a thinker or you're going to be someone who responds to all the stimulus.
[03:47:09.020 --> 03:47:13.220]  America's future lies in individuals having autonomy, being able to ask questions because
[03:47:13.220 --> 03:47:16.660]  all learning starts from the question mark. They teach us with declarative sentences in
[03:47:16.660 --> 03:47:19.500]  all these books that you so you can't gain knowledge from hearing someone else use a
[03:47:19.500 --> 03:47:20.580]  declarative sentence.
[03:47:20.580 --> 03:47:24.840]  You have to go through your observation, identification, organization and communication process to
[03:47:24.840 --> 03:47:29.560]  actually learn. They're killing the scientific method, right? Right. So they're doing this
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:31.860]  to us because they are kind of jealous of us.
[03:47:31.860 --> 03:47:35.780]  They can't be happy just with what we have as normal human beings. They have to have
[03:47:35.780 --> 03:47:40.220]  it all. They have a sickness, call it greed, call it aggression, call it whatever you want.
[03:47:40.220 --> 03:47:41.220]  Control freakism.
[03:47:41.220 --> 03:47:44.580]  Control freakism. And they've been trying to dissolve everything that made America what
[03:47:44.580 --> 03:47:49.340]  it was to stand alone from the British and reintegrate us into an Anglo American establishment.
[03:47:49.340 --> 03:47:52.940]  So you know, through the legacy of Cecil Rhodes and the CFR and Pilgrim Society and Foreign
[03:47:52.940 --> 03:47:56.160]  Affairs and all these different, you know, working groups and different projects.
[03:47:56.160 --> 03:47:57.780]  Tell me about this Foreign Affairs publication.
[03:47:57.780 --> 03:48:02.860]  This Foreign Affairs article basically talking about transnationalism and transnationalists
[03:48:02.860 --> 03:48:06.820]  do not have grandiose plans for a one world government, but they but they give various
[03:48:06.820 --> 03:48:12.900]  rules of force of law without having to win majorities for those rules and democratically
[03:48:12.900 --> 03:48:13.900]  elected legislatures.
[03:48:13.900 --> 03:48:17.060]  So basically, through this idea of transnationalism, they're changing American law.
[03:48:17.060 --> 03:48:18.980]  We don't want world government, we're just above the law.
[03:48:18.980 --> 03:48:23.220]  Right. And they're above the Constitution. And so in very clever wordspeak, you can learn
[03:48:23.220 --> 03:48:24.220]  because they-
[03:48:24.220 --> 03:48:25.900]  No, they always say we're not setting up world government.
[03:48:25.900 --> 03:48:26.900]  Right.
[03:48:26.900 --> 03:48:27.900]  We're setting up world governance.
[03:48:27.900 --> 03:48:30.620]  I first became a fan of Foreign Affairs.
[03:48:30.620 --> 03:48:32.980]  There's a 1998 November issue-
[03:48:32.980 --> 03:48:34.060]  Show people.
[03:48:34.060 --> 03:48:38.580]  It's got the red tag on there, where they talk about Osama bin Laden, you know, war
[03:48:38.580 --> 03:48:42.060]  on terror and all these things three or four years before 2001.
[03:48:42.060 --> 03:48:45.980]  And the same people are writing the articles, Zelikow is one of the people, he was in charge
[03:48:45.980 --> 03:48:46.980]  of the 9-11 Commission.
[03:48:46.980 --> 03:48:50.740]  So you can totally see how they put out a business plan in a couple different articles
[03:48:50.740 --> 03:48:53.940]  in one CFR magazine in 1998.
[03:48:53.940 --> 03:48:55.060]  And then that comes to fruition-
[03:48:55.060 --> 03:49:01.060]  And then PNAC rewrites it September 2000 and says, we need a Pearl Harbor to tax, we can
[03:49:01.060 --> 03:49:03.020]  invade Afghanistan, take everybody's liberty.
[03:49:03.020 --> 03:49:04.020]  Right.
[03:49:04.020 --> 03:49:05.660]  I mean, they don't even mince words, it's all planned.
[03:49:05.660 --> 03:49:06.660]  Right out in the open.
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:07.660]  Yeah.
[03:49:07.660 --> 03:49:08.660]  So-
[03:49:08.660 --> 03:49:09.860]  But you just got to do the research, just find it.
[03:49:09.860 --> 03:49:13.260]  And it's so much, again, great about being able to get the resources that-
[03:49:13.260 --> 03:49:16.060]  But that's what's frustrating is it's all admitted.
[03:49:16.060 --> 03:49:17.700]  And it's all out there.
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:22.340]  Like Dallas said, Americans don't read, but all these books, like I have 20 or 30 books
[03:49:22.340 --> 03:49:26.660]  just on a Rothschild's, autobiographies, biographies, like this is their own primary sources.
[03:49:26.660 --> 03:49:27.780]  This isn't some tertiary-
[03:49:27.780 --> 03:49:29.860]  No, no, they say they're doing it.
[03:49:29.860 --> 03:49:30.860]  Right.
[03:49:30.860 --> 03:49:33.860]  It says on their own website, this is their history and the Battle of Waterloo and the
[03:49:33.860 --> 03:49:37.960]  whole history that you hear about as conspiracy is on the official Rothschild websites.
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:42.220]  So as I went through and familiarized myself with how all these social institutions like
[03:49:42.220 --> 03:49:46.060]  Roll Call, Congressional Quarterly, Economist, those are all Rothschild entities.
[03:49:46.060 --> 03:49:50.140]  The official magazines of our Congress are owned through the Rothschild banking empire.
[03:49:50.140 --> 03:49:52.540]  So when you look at their control over media and politicians-
[03:49:52.540 --> 03:49:55.100]  CIA set up National Review.
[03:49:55.100 --> 03:49:56.100]  Sure.
[03:49:56.100 --> 03:49:57.580]  And so it's not just one group of people.
[03:49:57.580 --> 03:50:01.140]  There's a common agenda of collectivism that's gone on through history and the individual
[03:50:01.140 --> 03:50:05.660]  is not able to demonstrate intellectual self-defense until you grasp the same tools that they're
[03:50:05.660 --> 03:50:09.500]  using against you and you use them for yourself, for liberty and the liberty of others instead
[03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:12.100]  of trying to oppress everybody like they're doing.
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:20.060]  Man, it is so amazing that they own the whole fake spectrum of alternative media, the so-called
[03:50:20.060 --> 03:50:24.580]  alternative media like Foreign Affairs, which is actually put out by the CFR and they act
[03:50:24.580 --> 03:50:27.800]  like it's alternative or you get things like National Review.
[03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:32.220]  And then I know I built all this myself with my listeners and I'm not controlled and I
[03:50:32.220 --> 03:50:33.960]  know there's other people that aren't controlled.
[03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:37.780]  I think that's what's really freaking them out is that they were going off an old paradigm
[03:50:37.780 --> 03:50:39.420]  that, oh, they won't know how to use video editing.
[03:50:39.420 --> 03:50:40.700]  They won't know how to use this.
[03:50:40.700 --> 03:50:41.700]  They won't be able to do that.
[03:50:41.700 --> 03:50:42.700]  But it backfired.
[03:50:42.700 --> 03:50:44.300]  I don't, I think they're in deep trouble.
[03:50:44.300 --> 03:50:46.300]  They're on hubris, you know.
[03:50:46.300 --> 03:50:50.180]  What is it, Hillary Clinton said, you know, they're losing the information war.
[03:50:50.180 --> 03:50:52.340]  I mean, they're coming out saying it.
[03:50:52.340 --> 03:50:54.220]  What the gods would conquer, they must first divide.
[03:50:54.220 --> 03:50:58.460]  And if we make ourselves individuals who are unassailable intellectually and we can bind
[03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:04.600]  together voluntarily with other individuals to secure our liberty, all of your filtration
[03:51:04.600 --> 03:51:10.460]  in one system, portable on the go, no more do you have two or three filters to just reduce
[03:51:10.460 --> 03:51:11.740]  sodium fluoride.

[03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:28.780]  filter element.

[03:54:02.540 --> 03:54:17.780]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network.
[03:54:17.780 --> 03:54:21.460]  James Lane and Richard Grove are our guests, remindsfilms.com.
[03:54:21.460 --> 03:54:26.140]  You can get the new film State of Mind and get a free film with it at infowarsstore.com
[03:54:26.140 --> 03:54:28.580]  for a very limited time and that supports the broadcast.
[03:54:28.580 --> 03:54:31.900]  You guys will be back on the news tonight and back at the studio with me tomorrow where
[03:54:31.900 --> 03:54:35.940]  you head back to your hacienda in Oklahoma and then we're going to shoot a big special
[03:54:35.940 --> 03:54:41.540]  report tomorrow that will air when we premiere State of Mind for the prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[03:54:41.540 --> 03:54:45.620]  But you guys in the last five minutes make any other points because I really agree with
[03:54:45.620 --> 03:54:46.700]  your analysis.
[03:54:46.700 --> 03:54:52.260]  You guys have done your research and I just think it's fantastic to see the knowledge
[03:54:52.260 --> 03:54:54.260]  of the globalist tyranny spreading.
[03:54:54.260 --> 03:55:00.180]  We now have the fire of Prometheus with which we can burn the devil to the ground.
[03:55:00.180 --> 03:55:04.260]  We were saying that State of Mind touches on every subject that's covered on Infowars.
[03:55:04.260 --> 03:55:08.580]  This is a hub that people can use to show friends and family all the spokes that they
[03:55:08.580 --> 03:55:09.900]  can go from there.
[03:55:09.900 --> 03:55:10.900]  It's a jumping point.
[03:55:10.900 --> 03:55:14.900]  Side Wars applies to every subject you guys cover on Infowars and so it's the primary
[03:55:14.900 --> 03:55:15.900]  thing.
[03:55:15.900 --> 03:55:19.040]  We send our kids out to public schools without letting them know how to tell when someone's
[03:55:19.040 --> 03:55:20.420]  lying to them.
[03:55:20.420 --> 03:55:23.540]  We send our kids out in the world unprepared and we never really outgrow that extent.
[03:55:23.540 --> 03:55:27.620]  If you send them letting them know it's a brainwashing camp, it'll actually work against
[03:55:27.620 --> 03:55:28.620]  the enemy.
[03:55:28.620 --> 03:55:29.620]  Right.
[03:55:29.620 --> 03:55:30.620]  Because your kids genetically know to listen to you.
[03:55:30.620 --> 03:55:33.100]  Right, so they spend a lot of time trying to divide and conquer our homes and what the
[03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:35.540]  gods would seek to conquer, they must first divide.
[03:55:35.540 --> 03:55:40.100]  So if we recognize that there is an Infowar, there's a war on for our mind and we need
[03:55:40.100 --> 03:55:43.700]  to get together with our friends and family and we need to learn our way out of this.
[03:55:43.700 --> 03:55:48.140]  We need to act voluntarily to form groups and that's how we keep ourselves safe.
[03:55:48.140 --> 03:55:51.420]  Not by waiting for the state or the authorities to come and protect us.
[03:55:51.420 --> 03:55:56.100]  In the case of Boston, there's a million people on lockdown to find one 19-year-old suspect.
[03:55:56.100 --> 03:55:57.100]  That's unreasonable.
[03:55:57.100 --> 03:55:58.100]  That's insanity.
[03:55:58.100 --> 03:55:59.100]  Yeah, it is insanity.
[03:55:59.100 --> 03:56:01.940]  They're just walking up to people's houses and they're like, no, that's fine.
[03:56:01.940 --> 03:56:02.940]  Come on in.
[03:56:02.940 --> 03:56:07.980]  And it's only gonna get worse unless we intellectually rise up, practice intellectual self-defense,
[03:56:07.980 --> 03:56:11.500]  which is knowing how to deal with the words and the lies and the process and remove the
[03:56:11.500 --> 03:56:14.620]  fallacies so that we can actually find knowledge consistently.
[03:56:14.620 --> 03:56:15.620]  Absolutely.
[03:56:15.620 --> 03:56:18.020]  You wanted to get into Huxley.
[03:56:18.020 --> 03:56:19.260]  I heard you mentioning him.
[03:56:19.260 --> 03:56:22.460]  Well, you had mentioned Huxley before and I couldn't help thinking about the ultimate
[03:56:22.460 --> 03:56:27.380]  revolution speech that he gave at Berkeley, I believe in 1961 or 62, where he says, we're
[03:56:27.380 --> 03:56:32.040]  gonna make you love your servitude and that the human being, if you don't think between
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:35.200]  stimulus and response, they're gonna have total control because there's a unity box
[03:56:35.200 --> 03:56:38.220]  on everyone's wall and it's giving you the corporate media.
[03:56:38.220 --> 03:56:41.420]  It's giving you all the same news on every channel, different logos.
[03:56:41.420 --> 03:56:42.540]  It's all the same news.
[03:56:42.540 --> 03:56:43.780]  And so you have to get beyond that.
[03:56:43.780 --> 03:56:47.540]  You actually have to start using your observation skills and go beyond what they're showing
[03:56:47.540 --> 03:56:48.540]  you.
[03:56:48.540 --> 03:56:49.640]  And that's where the real world is.
[03:56:49.640 --> 03:56:53.100]  And that's what I think people can discover as a function of state of mind is they can
[03:56:53.100 --> 03:56:54.100]  outgrow the status quo.
[03:56:54.100 --> 03:56:57.380]  Well, we found an interview with Mike Wallace.
[03:56:57.380 --> 03:57:03.200]  I'm sorry, Huxley was on there in 1953 and he basically described the world we're living
[03:57:03.200 --> 03:57:04.200]  in today.
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:07.340]  No, he said, brave new world is our plan.
[03:57:07.340 --> 03:57:11.260]  And talk about the pharmacological control of the anti-authoritarian personality.
[03:57:11.260 --> 03:57:12.700]  I mean, there it was.
[03:57:12.700 --> 03:57:13.700]  We see it every day.
[03:57:13.700 --> 03:57:15.300]  I mean, the kids are drugged.
[03:57:15.300 --> 03:57:19.740]  I mean, anybody goes in for the slightest thing, it's like, just a film full of pharmaceuticals.
[03:57:19.740 --> 03:57:21.580]  And then say you have no rights once you've been.
[03:57:21.580 --> 03:57:25.900]  And those are results of the psychedelic revolution, which was part of MK Ultra Subproject 58.
[03:57:25.900 --> 03:57:29.700]  John Ervin at Gnostic Media has done a lot of great work on this because there are CIA
[03:57:29.700 --> 03:57:33.340]  documents, FOIA request documents where you can see JP Morgan and company getting the
[03:57:33.340 --> 03:57:34.340]  financials.
[03:57:34.340 --> 03:57:37.940]  Here's how much money they're getting out of CIA MK Ultra Subproject 58.
[03:57:37.940 --> 03:57:43.980]  And that goes into Time Life magazine of May 27th, 1957.
[03:57:43.980 --> 03:57:46.500]  May 13th, 1957, Time Life.
[03:57:46.500 --> 03:57:51.380]  It's the introduction of magic mushrooms to the world through Henry Luce's Time Life magazine
[03:57:51.380 --> 03:57:57.020]  run by C.D. Jackson, who is a psychological warfare specialist who worked with Nelson
[03:57:57.020 --> 03:57:58.020]  Rockefeller.
[03:57:58.020 --> 03:58:02.260]  But then it backfired and they wanted it removed and then they brought out the Prozac.
[03:58:02.260 --> 03:58:04.140]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:58:04.140 --> 03:58:09.740]  And most of these psychotropic drugs are just a synthetic LSD without the the trippiness
[03:58:09.740 --> 03:58:10.740]  to it.
[03:58:10.740 --> 03:58:12.580]  So they are very like molecularly.
[03:58:12.580 --> 03:58:13.580]  They're very similar.
[03:58:13.580 --> 03:58:14.580]  They got them in dream states.
[03:58:14.580 --> 03:58:15.580]  Yeah.
[03:58:15.580 --> 03:58:16.580]  Program state.
[03:58:16.580 --> 03:58:20.740]  So people on this 20 percent of the public, roughly, are on a mind control programming
[03:58:20.740 --> 03:58:23.540]  drug now to be interfaced with the subliminals.
[03:58:23.540 --> 03:58:26.980]  And Huxley's talking about that way to be a combination of propaganda and pharmacological
[03:58:26.980 --> 03:58:29.140]  control, diet, injections and injunctions.
[03:58:29.140 --> 03:58:30.460]  Richard Russell talks about this.
[03:58:30.460 --> 03:58:34.260]  Zinske talks about guys get the film state of mind and for store dot com.
[03:58:34.260 --> 03:58:35.260]  See you back live tomorrow.
[03:58:35.260 --> 03:59:04.500]  And God bless you all.
