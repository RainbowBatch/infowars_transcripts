Alex Jones
we got Aaron Dyches report coming up on this Wednesday edition the 27th day of
February 2013 where he breaks down the incredible open threat of Napolitano
that hey don't cut our homeland security funding or the terrorist will strike we
mentioned some of this yesterday but it's amazing and Leo let us spy on you
without Warren so the terrorist will strike while they're running the real
terrorist networks overseas we're going to be breaking all of that down coming
up in the next segment and we are also going to have Catherine Albrick to Dr.
Catherine Albrick who's one of the leading researchers and voices out there
exposing the smart slave grid the smart meters the RFID the smart cards the
biometric thumb scanning the drone robot takeover so we're going to be breaking
all of that down with her today here in studio in studio with Catherine Albrick
she's scheduled for an hour but we might have her a little bit longer to take
your phone calls I do want to take calls as well today here we have a bunch of
key articles up at info wars calm because the Huffington Post and others
have been running hoaxes that Hitler was actually kind of a nice guy I didn't
take any guns well they say he's a bad guy but he was pro-gun so they're trying
to demonize us eyewitness yes the Nazis did confiscate guns plus we have the
Nuremberg trial and the Nazi gun laws that's up at info wars calm New York
seven-round law bans most firearms that's right
Kurt Nemo has a report I mean there's your gun ban right there and they're
arresting people it's happening they're persecuting law-abiding citizens with
no criminal record with their unconstitutional law that is a fraud
explosive report 98% of newborn babies are genetically screened oh yeah they're
taking your blood it's a new report finally the mainstream media admits it
but I've told you this 15 years ago with the documents leaked out of the Pentagon
via San Antonio you know just groundbreaking information no big deal
though because I'm a conspiracy theorist big sis threatens terror attack over
sequestration cuts or government castrating the public cuts Illinois
State Rep compares gun control to population control DHS to release 10,000
legals while building new detention centers key article by Paul Joseph
Watson that we are going to be getting into in great detail as well today like

print that print that now for everybody out there watching on TV what I do on my
computer it's kind of cool you see everything I'm doing in here I like that
it's total total transparency so that I can just communicate everything that's
why the office listens to the show because I sit here and I guess kind of a
public office meeting here on the air as well I saw my stories but I missed my
featured news stack maybe it was mixed in with the others but there is so much
going on that we're gonna be breaking down here today we've got a bunch of
special reports that we're gonna be premiering here boner slams move to
release detained immigrants when he's trying to release and legalize them all
anyways with Obama this is all theater I'm gonna be breaking that down we've
also got again Napolitano trying to hold us all captive give her more money or
the terrorists will get us pretty obvious who stands the game from the
terrorism pretty obvious who has the motive if you're have an IQ above room
temperature and know what the word motive means and we also have the ABC

rallying Patriots worldwide
you're listening to the Alex Jones show
America Europe and most of the world is being held captive by a private Mafia
cartel that receives control of the world's financial systems and controls
the planet first through fractional reserve banking and now through
derivatives kiting that makes any other form of Ponzi scheme pale
insignificance and that is the system that we are facing that is the big
enchilada that is the key to the lock to free our society is that we have private
mega corporations only about six and most of the fortune 500 are there
interlocking subsidiaries the few that aren't are being forced to sell out or
being mopped up right now it is a global corporate consolidation dictatorship
into one huge combine and its goal is to make us surf and forcibly reduce
population and many say well go ahead and reduce the population there too many
people because you live in an urban environment that distorts reality and
makes you think that there's a you know too many fish in the sea but you could
go 20 miles in the sea and not see a single fish till you come to a coral
reef and see tens of thousands it's the same thing with cities and mega cities
and mega op Alyssa's but I digress these globalist have the symbol of energy
money digital and physical which has no real worth but that we will work fight
and die kill sell our body sell our ideas sell our children into slavery to
survive or more importantly in the modern age of mind control to sit high
on the pedestal in the parrot tree that's all parents care about is sitting
the highest in the tree in a sign of status like chimpanzees the king
chimpanzee the leader of the troops sitting high up on the hill looking down
on the others the fake status the primitive the primitive ambrosia or
opiate of the animal clash well I have the body of an animal but the mind the
mind that is the key to the universe and show to you ladies and gentlemen so you
and don't let them ever tell you your crap don't let the globalist ever tell
you you're worthless they're trying to tell you that so you believe that so you
never develop because they're threatened by you developing they know the power of
the individual because they've taken over and they know their power and they
know you're even more powerful all right let me get into all the news here we're
being held hostage by this global mafia combine they hold us hostage and say
give up all your rights or al-qaeda will kill you they're doing that again we're
gonna cover that in a moment they hold us hostage and say shine on to our 1.5
quadrille it's more like two quadrille now that that number is about two years
old out of the Washington Post our our side of the debt they tell us that we
don't owe is is the 644 trill that's what they say Americans owe of that 1.5
quadrille and dr. Tarpley who's an economist has broken that down as well
let's get Tarpley back on about the economy and what's the meltdown in
Europe see if you could see if you can get him on tomorrow or Adams is in on
Friday or on the Sunday show thanks but specifically you got to tell him what
he's on about her he'll cover whatever he wants which is fine but I want to get
into the meltdown in Europe where he sees that going where the current
economic situation is because he always wants to cover how we fix it and I get
his view and how we fix it my point is they're not following that view so he
side issue just make sure when you set him up he knows that or I guess he
listens the show sometimes he tells me he does so maybe he hears that I'll just
say hey Tarpley come on about this and then it's about that show that's why I
hadn't been on lately just because it's always like a wild card but I do enjoy
having him on the point is there is 1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion more like
the actual member I saw recently was it's gone up by another 400 or so so 1.9
quadrille and the derivatives has increased since 2008 and there then
they've got new global bubbles on real estate but that's still only what here
in the u.s. 50 60 you know billion dollars and if you add it all up
together all the real estate that's got problems 300 400 billion dollars how are
we being signed on to trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions
and trillions and trillions and trillions it's an artificial wall of
fraud they built up to then make us think we're signed on to it this big
giant ball and chain and I guess if you look at all the real commitments we've
been signed on to that are actually our debts 16 trillion roughly federal debt
you add in I guess the commercial real estate the rest of it it's in the
multi trillions but still that could easily be bailed out and fixed but we've
been signed on to prop up the 1.5 quadrillion 600 plus trillion of that
we're told is our debt
and it's amazing I mean these numbers are even hard to hard to grasp for
myself and they're holding us hostage with that saying you will do this or too
big to fail the whole economy goes down as the economy goes down anyways and as
they use the bailout 85 billion a month 40 plus billion of that just two
derivatives and most of that's foreign derivatives and if you're a new
listener like well where's the proof just type in 85 million a month to
foreign banks half of it to derivatives only this is what's going on and now
they're holding us hostage saying we're gonna release all these thousands of
many of violent illegal aliens under sequestration because we don't have
money to hold them when I've seen articles in the Houston Chronicle work
where they released hundreds of thousands in a single year over 200,000
illegal aliens many of which were violent felons aggravated felons here in
the United States just in Texas alone it's routine the feds just release these
people anyways and and and deport a paltry amount basically a show and raid
a few meatpacking plants a year and have a big show that they're doing something
I mean remember homeland security under Bush hired illegal aliens to build the
wall the show wall so that's what's going on here
we're being held hostage when we come back from break I'm gonna play Aaron
Dykes's report that ties into big sis threatens terror attack over
sequestration cuts and she's saying you don't cut our tens upon tens upon tens
of billions what's the total budget of homeless here something like 80 billion
dollars or something ridiculous I mean they're paying for helicopters
that cost $400,000 and they say oh it's free federal money the helicopters that
the feds are paying for sheriff's departments and police departments to
get all over the country Katie outside Houston got one last year and crashed it
on the test flight now there it is the polyton of speech to intimidate a mere
85 billion dollar budget cuts with the threat of new terror attacks now she's
trying to intimate that if you don't give her the extra 85 billion dollars
that the terrorists are gonna get us any minute and you've got the very terrorist
working for NATO and the globalist and for the Secretary of State now approved
Hegel publicly and it's hiding in plain view just like the troops opium
production went from 10% to 93% within just a few years of the liberation of
Afghanistan and then we talked about it and it comes out so they go oh yeah on
Fox News and CNN and ABC Nightly News yeah we grow the opium and ship it into
America and Europe but if we catch you with it you're going to jail next news
story and they did that because the troops were complaining and saying we're
being told to help grow the opium and it's being trucked off to air bases and
this is incredible I mean if you get caught in your car with heroin folks
you're gonna be lucky if you get five six years probation even if it's a
usable amount I've looked at the different sentencing and what's been
happening most of the time you actually get a couple years in jail
for being a user of a product the government grows and ships in you're
like let it make sense it makes perfect sense they put you in their private
presence that are guaranteed 90% occupancy under state laws and they
ship something in that's addictive that funds them that people then robbed
folks's houses and things to buy the overpriced product because they've made
it illegal in a black market and then when they catch you using it they make
you a slave a nonviolent slave in one of their factories for 25 cents an hour
competing with everybody else and so it's the instinct to hold us hostage
give up your rights so there'll be drugs on the street they're shipping in give
up your rights or al-qaeda will attack you that the globalist the foreign banks
that have hijacked is run give us total power or the economy will implode too
big to fail and now give us unlimited spending increases and more taxes and
there aren't talk about more taxes this year after that see because after they
get you the debts doubled since Obama's been in and it's gonna double again
faster and faster and it's gonna be more tax more tax or we're gonna take your
401k now that's already started they're gonna take everything and always say
everything will collapse if we don't take your 401k everything will collapse
if we don't raise your payroll tax everything will collapse and we don't
double health care costs everything while they're collapsing it but
collapsing it into their hands as a tool of making you poor and now they're
saying we're gonna release 10,000 illegal aliens while prison planet.com
article building new detention centers and I've always told you because this is
in Rex 84 congressional hearings 1986 they're online the whole hearings with
Oliver North the rest of it Miami Herald you name it
Senator Inouye saying we will not touch upon that matter at this time with
Congressman Jack Brooks in a bipartisan committee hearings the Iran Contra
hearings that they were gonna build FEMA centers to put citizens in and prime
them with illegals and then later legalize the illegals turn them all
loose actually make them soldiers the biggest part of the military's now
illegals they're legalized and put Americans black white Hispanic who
aren't basically communist in them they're like but Oliver North was
anti-communist you don't get this folks he was anti-iran too wasn't he shipping
weapons to the Ayatollahs folks when you figure out the triple double games it's
full spectrum dominance the bankers run all of it all of it all the big
institutions they're trying to mop up the middle-sized things and systems they
don't control that's why the battle is on they meant to already have this whole
thing taken over by now they're behind they can be defeated we'll be right back

all right the video of this report is up at info Wars calm big sis threatens
terror attack oversee quest ration cuts this is an act of terrorism they have
the motive to stage terror or allow terror attacks so that we allow them to
take over our society just like Hitler firebomb his own Reichstag here's Aaron
Dykes under sequestration immigration and customs enforcement also part of DHS
will be forced to reduce detention and removal perhaps most critically it would
have serious consequences to the flow of trade and travel so the sequestration
budget cuts are here a measly 85 billion dollars of automatic cuts because they
couldn't agree on real budget cuts that will basically do nothing to the
American budget and yet in the news we have Janet Napolitano head of Homeland
Security openly making threats that if they dare touch her precious Homeland
Security budget there might be new terror attacks or there might be a new
wave of immigrants illegally flooding across the border let's play a short
clip of that right now look I don't think we can maintain the same level of
security at all places around the country with sequester as without
sequester threats from terrorism and the need to respond and recover from natural
disasters do not diminish because of budget cuts let's just call it for what
it is it's a veiled threat it is terrorism and we know who the real
terrorists are we've seen countless false flag events from 9-11 on down from
the phony underwear bomber scenario used to sell body scanners to the public and
of course the setting up of Homeland Security itself to terrorize the people
we know what it is the dictionary definition of terrorism is the
systematic use of fear or terror as a means of coercion and that's just what
they're doing and of course Janet Napolitano says she's not trying to
scare anyone she just wants them to plan for what if if there's not enough money
for TSA to grow passengers and what to do if there's longer lines and you have
to wait to get on a plane or if you're not able to make your flight average
wait times to clear customs will increase by as much as 50% and at our
busiest airports like Newark and JFK LAX and O'Hare peak wait times which can
reach over two hours could easily grow to four hours Homeland Security and
other national security figures Napolitano on down don't want the public
to even think that these national security apparatuses can be targeted by
budget cuts so that's why they want to reiterate the fear they admittedly did
it during the Bush administration using their color-coded fear chart every time
Bush was down in the polls or that he faced reelection or that the public was
beginning to doubt that the war on terror was real now we see it again as
we already have in the Obama administration the fear-mongering over
checks won't go out people are gonna starve people are gonna go hungry and
then here's Napolitano adding on to that that the country will break down and
passengers will have to wait in lines and the TSA won't be able to do its job
and it's not our fault if there's more terror attacks well we know who's
clearly behind the staged phony terror in this country we also know that
Homeland Security and TSA have never caught a real terrorist especially at
airports and that the only terrorists they have set up and charged are those
led by admitted FBI sting operations but Napolitano wants you to think that her
precious Homeland Security budget is untouchable and that they have a right
to occupy and control the direction of this country of course Homeland Security
is real money comes through black budgets and is used for continuity of
government operations setting up a FEMA camps and a lot more no one's even
pretending to touch that money under sequestration immigration and customs
enforcement would not be able to maintain the 34,000 detention beds as
required by Congress it would also reduce our investigative activities in
areas like human smuggling they want you to be afraid of a wave of illegal
immigration even though they're admittedly planning to give amnesty to
more than 11 million immigrants and pretty much openly don't do anything to
restrict the border in fact Department of Justice and others give weapons to
the drug cartels allow them to shut ship in their drugs and then launder the
money on Wall Street they just want to again control and instill fear in the
American public that are not going to do anything to stop illegal immigration one
way or another and they're certainly not going to stop terrorism which they
could just use to further their own agenda we see through you Janet
Apolitano we know that your odor comes from a defensive mechanism like a skunk
or like a stink beetle to keep people away from your little precious jewel
agency of Homeland Security so they'll think they can't cut your budget and
you'll just excrete this defensive odor upon the people will stop it you're
repugnant you're repugnant to the Constitution get away from our Bill of
Rights stop using it as your toilet paper signing off for info Wars calm I'm
Aaron Dykes hi I'm Janet Napolitano secretary of Homeland Security if you
try to take our money that is rightfully ours we will unleash a legion of
terrorists on you because we need our money to put our hands down your pants

freedoms and to pay for targets that look like pregnant women and old men to
thinning their homes those are the real terrorists

scoring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap those
revisions women are still worth 10 points more than men at all age brackets
but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70
points the big score anyone any sex over 75 years old has been upped to 100
points as always how fast you move determines how long you live
resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones
Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central we're here live you know what
this is such good good good children's music I think we should crank it up

having her here when she gets here and at the same time we will give the phone
number out right now to get your take on all the news that's taking place
specifically holding us hostage give us more money or terrorists will attack
give us more money to foreign banks or will implode the economy give us more
money don't cut one nickel out of any of the federal budget that actually gets
bigger by hundreds of billions of dollars a year or the terrorists will
literally murder everybody give us more money or we have to give 85 billion
dollars of foreign banks I mean it's a joke how obvious and transparent all of
this is I just want to be clear you guys killed that Boehner clip boner clip
slams moved to release detained immigrants we're gonna play that in a
moment and again sounds like good rhetoric out of him because look Mexico
is a failed state upwards of 60,000 dead the last five years last time I checked
it was 59,000 dead bodies found everywhere heads chopped off total
tyranny one of the most corrupt governments on earth probably after ours
our government is better at hiding it not for long and well I mean there it's
just it's just so lawless that they're just destroying everything and that's
what corruption will do it'll grow and grow and grow and grow until like locust
the corrupt just can't control each other anymore and they destroy all the
mechanisms that produce the wealth it's kind of like a goose that lays the
golden eggs a smart criminal government wants a big fat healthy gush because
it's getting the eggs anyways that's a boss hog type thing no no that's not
what's going on here I don't like boss hog either cuz cuz boss hog isn't gonna
want me you know you know to be free but but still boss hog if you give him a you
know give him his little is his money he'll usually leave you alone these guys
don't want you making money they want to be the only ones running the factories
running the systems and why should they then have to produce for you they they
have the instinct of dominators the instinct of debilitators the instinct of
people that want blight and things rotting and and they destroy art
literature culture they destroy the family they destroy everything that is
of the greater angels in men and they they lower everything down
Chelsea we've got a report coming up on this effect I'm gonna get to this report
get the shit get get the report ready I've got to cover this I said I'd take
calls but not yet get the report ready of the quick comment by Boehner and then
I want to play the clip the special report that David Knight just did up at
one of the big gun rallies in Texas in Dallas with a famous survivor of
Chelsea who then came to the u.s. became a lawyer and battled him in the
international courts before he ended up being overthrown by his own people and
and they were a prosperous country but it took the communists about a decade to
really take over and really wreck things and by the end he had him trained to
only have about two hours of power a day nationwide and he had his own pleasure
city that had to be a power all the time and his own giant golf courses bowling
alleys everything and they do it as a tool of total control you understand
people like how could Obama raise taxes on poor people that's so cold-blooded
well that's the plan so let's go ahead and play Boehner here's Boehner the
agency that enforces immigration laws in this country confirmed today that it is
at this moment releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants from u.s. detention
centers because it says with the sequestration they can't afford to keep
them is this what you intended this is very hard for me to believe that they
can't find cuts elsewhere in their agency I frankly think this is outrageous
and I'm looking for more facts but I can't believe that they can't find the
kind of savings they need out of that department a short of letting criminals
go free all right in the bush plan that senator sessions exposed remember they
were supposed to six years ago have a secret vote on immigration reform as the
last three had failed but sessions said I'm not following unconstitutional Senate
rules and released it they were gonna have felon illegal aliens not be
deported when they serve their term and to sign a pledge not to commit more
felonies look it up aggravated felonies you know an aggravated felony is home
invasion rape carjacking and remember that the the railway killer who killed
dozens of people and they just kept releasing him again they and they also
mainly feed on the immigrant community the giant criminal hordes that have fled
Mexico and come up here are above the stinking law and have taken over
organized crime in the southwest and are now intimidating the police and buying
them off we're gonna fall just like Mexico I'm telling you this is how Rome
fell and I'm not even for this Roman Empire but let me tell you falling into
the barbarians will and that's what this is third world countries are in a
barbarian state and civilization could easily collapse in this country it did
in Russia for a while and it's still pretty bad I mean this is out of control
what the corrupt are doing they're destroying everything because they have
an instinct against the good producers they have an instinct of hating the
regular hard-working person they hate you they hate Christians we're gonna
play a clip right now David Knight and David Ortiz went up did a great report
in Dallas on the big national day of resistance this Saturday and there's two
reports here's David Knight's part of the report we'll get to David's in the
third hour if we have time it's all up at info wars news.com or prison planet
TV if you're not a subscriber what are you waiting for folks we are the tip of
the spear we need your support down more than ever I want to thank all you that
have supported us let's start getting to his report here it is
well the keynote speaker was a lady who had lived under Romanian dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu and like so many people that we've talked to before she
has an important story with warnings to tell us about how it got to that
position what it was like to live there and like so many of the other people her
warning is that we're headed in that direction with many parallels here's
what she had to say more than 20 years ago I was exiled from communist Romania
to America the greatest country in the world I came to America as a political
refugee from communist Romania I had with me two daughters and I was pregnant
with my son I have no money and I did not know one word in English after
mastering English I was admitted and in three years I graduated from SMU Law
School with two degrees Juris Doctor and Master of Laws after that I established
my own law firm meanwhile I raised three children as a single mom I am the
American dream but I should be dead buried somewhere in an unmarked grave in
Romania according to the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu the only thing that
make my journey possible fighting and winning against communists in Romania is
my decision to trust God to help me fight for freedom if we lose freedom in
America there is no place to escape to the socialist system is governed by the
big government who owns all the means of production distribution and determines
the good for its people the socialist system replaced the free market with
government control and eradicates private property freedom of speech
freedom of the press religious rights and self-determination as a nation in
the name of promoting fair share justice and equality the socialist terms most of
its people in true equally poor people
means bringing the country's standard of living to the lowest level possible soon
after Ceausescu was elected president he governed Romania with an iron fist as a
despot as an as a tyrant according to him with the people of Romania was his
subjects owned by him and he wanted to make all the decisions for us he
nationalized big area of our economy he eliminated the free market economy of
Romania and replace it with his dictatorial communist control as
businesses had to abide the government's new request rules regulations they
started to produce low quality products that we the customers were forced to buy
at the price established by the government he ruined our economy well I
was curious when she talked in her speech about Ceausescu taking away the
free market and other freedoms because I was under the impression that everything
just came down like a hammer when the first communist dictators came in but
like Bert from Poland who if you remember an interview we had with him a
few weeks ago things didn't happen all at once just like things are not
happening all at once here in America now Berta told us that in Poland it took
several decades for the communist system to completely suppress and kill all the
free market and private businesses that were there and of course once those were
gone things got really bad but here's how mrs. Prodan described the Romanian
takeover
of socialist and communist leaders but he was the worst one. He was the one, the only one who declared himself God and he was the one who fought against Christians and churches demolishing
churches and putting Christians in jail about he made the social secret police
his personal special forces and he developed the informants he was worse
than Stalin worse than Hitler. He killed many people I am a miracle that I am
alive. I believe the reason is that that protected me and because in Romania
being a woman means nothing and he was struck a surprise that I took him to court
and I won cases and I exposed him for two years and Voice of America free Europe.
Well there's some interesting parallels between this dictator who thought of
himself as God and American leaders who think they should control every aspect
of our life. Here's what Virginia had to say about that. He changed our health care
system for worse into a national health care system. Patient-doctor relationship
vanished. Patients and doctors lost their freedom. Hospitals were
administrated and medication were rationalized by government to patients.
Before socialists came to Romania in power Romania was a rich country with a
free market economy a good health care and good school system. Bucharest the
capital of Romania was called little Paris but with socialist and Ceausescu
strict control system very soon Romania experienced a drastic shortage of food
fuel energy medicine and all the other necessities. Well it wasn't just a
complete takeover of health care Ceausescu also went after the guns. Using
altruistic purposes too many kids killed or hurt by guns the socialism government
immediately established gun control in Romania. It created a police system
securitate to control and silence everyone including the media. The
securitate was the dictators elite special forces his loyalist and a very
privileged group of people. The dictators ears and eyes they were powerful and
above the law. The secret police also recruited civilian informants. The
youngest informant was eight years old. Notice how the monopoly in force went
hand-in-hand with the surveillance state. I was an attorney in Romania and I am an
attorney in America. Like you I was born with a hunger for truth and freedom but
I was born in communist Romania. A land of lies and a prison land not one
with real stone walls steel bars and watchtower but a prison land
nevertheless. The stone walls were the cruel and harsh life and treatment from
the government. The bars were lies and the watchtowers were the suspicions
anxiety secrets and fears they were everywhere in Ceausescu Romania.
Living in that prison planet surveillance state I asked Ms. Prodan
what she thought of the watchtowers and think about as she describes it think
about the parallels between our current surveillance state.
We had like I said secret police everywhere I was I had microphones in my house in my office I had secret
police in outside of my home 24 hours a day they have informants everything who was able to listen.
So we all live in a constant state of
anxiety and mistrust where one could be denounced for anti-government statement
by anyone a neighbor a classmate even a family member. For many people the only
way to avoid dictators punishment usually jail or death was to remain
silent to blend in and when she talked about taking Ceausescu to court I was
curious if they had laws there that protected any individual rights on what
basis did she win. Now there's been a Second Amendment speech of a fellow who
was at Tiananmen Square and in Massachusetts and he talked about the
fact that in China they had laws that protected most of the individual rights
that are enshrined in the Bill of Rights in America of course with the exception
of the Second Amendment but of course they didn't pay any attention to them
and similar thing happened in Romania but listen to how she described it.
Not sure if we have everything like in America but I'll give you an example.
We have laws in Romania that will protect churches and Christians but during the
interrogation the laws that I use them against the government and you hear me
saying that I won all of those cases and the reason is is because I use those
cases that nobody else in Romania wanted to use or dare to use and in the
interrogation by secret police those secret police told me that those laws
were in Romania in the books so Romania can have or maintain the most favored
national status with United States not for me to use against them. I was very
determined to use and I told them they're going to law school nobody told
me that and I really believe in those laws and I'm gonna use them and I I
So the laws there were just window dressing. Nobody really paid any
attention to it. Isn't it very much like what we have with the TSA and with the
Department of Homeland Security and with the NDAA so many places where we have
the laws in place we have very clear constitutional protections of our rights
and the government just chooses to ignore it but with all this surveillance
Virginia Prodan was not stopped. Listen to what carried her on.
When you stand up and fight for something it is surprising might be surprising for
others to hear but others will follow you or if they don't follow you at least
they will support you so don't think that you are by yourself because we are
never by ourselves I can tell you stories of unsung heroes in Romania who
helped me from Romania and also Americans like I said in my speech fear
and faith are contagious you have to make sure that you don't spread fear
around you fight with your own fear inside of you win because God is with
us and he can eliminate that fear and give us faith and courage spread
courage around you and you will be surprised how many people will be
encouraged and you will contaminate them and one person can change town city
state and then United States well I love what she said faith and fear are both
contagious and so it's kind of up to you isn't it are you gonna spread faith or
you're gonna spread fear are you going to encourage those around you or are
you going to be the weak spot that makes everybody else weaker well every day is
a day of resistance here at info wars and I hope you will join us in that
resistance I hope you will support our sponsors and if you're watching on

Eastern with the nightly news all right again my plan with the nightly news is
to take all these great pieces they put together an arum here on the crew did a
great job the big camera they took up there unexplainably broke or malfunction
the middle of the speech they went with handheld a little camera and still got
it all done but unusual quality in the info sorry about some of the quality on
the video but the guys it doesn't matter got the job done it's a great job to
David Knight and David Ortiz now expanding on that that's the key I've
always explained to you and that woman is famous what she did in Romania what
she did once she got out exposing it what she did and you could see the light
of Liberty in her eyes she's stronger she's more beautiful of soul of spirit
of everything because she went through the fire people get scared of the
tyranny they hear when I talk about the problems and it scares them my mission
is not to scare you my mission is to say hey we're in trouble become a leader
stand up others will stand with you others will follow and what she talks
about is so key anytime I've had little inklings of fear or the systems try to
scare me immediately I can feel God there with me and I know I'm doing the
right thing if you don't believe in God justice whatever you want to call it
doing the right thing my programming and it's like I have faith I'm going to
stand against this and the doors just open the enemy is absolutely scared of
people that love Liberty that's why they wear the black uniforms and the
helicopters and the checkpoints and and and the secret agents on TV and the
torture and and oh the sexy women torturing the people in zero dark 30 and
how they're the good guys and how they're doing all that because it's an
illusion they themselves have bought into most of them don't even know their
tyrants only the more high-level spymasters and global controllers know
that and
you know my dad through the church we went to in Dallas helped with missions
to Germany to get people out of East Germany I've never really talked about
that and we help people that got out of Germany and East Germany and things like
that that came to the u.s. I'm not going to go to the whole story but the point
is is that the government obviously knows that is that this is a real fight
ladies and gentlemen and communism is the eugenicist globalist science of
tyranny and they call themselves liberal they're not real liberals Thomas
Jefferson was a liberal and it's so important to realize these people are
not liberals and the Republicans at the highest levels of their partners in this
takeover but she talks about just trusting God and then all the things she
was able to do and that as soon as she stood up she had power and she'll
chesky of course was killed by the people finally when the police and
military woke up and the shell chesky model is something that we could see
happen in this country the problem is there's not just one dictator it's a
collection of corrupt system so we have to assassinate the character of the
corrupt system and the imposter system that's overtaken our Republic and
re-upload the Republic the Republic born-again hard come in join the team
come in for the big win all right our number two straight ahead info war.com

all right Catherine Albrecht has gotten here she's in the green room we'll get
her in here in the next segment dr. Catherine Albrecht leading voice and
exposing the technocracy hey you guys pull me the articles from this week
about the big mainstream news about the army of robots taking over the
technocracy I want to show viewers and listeners some of that so they don't
think I'm you know just talking about that because that's what I've been
talking about for 17 years and the smart dust and the RFID and all the rest of it
what's great is Catherine battles at full-time and just recently beat cancer
praise God and your prayers undoubtedly helped with that and she's gonna be
joining us in studio for a little more than an hour and we'll also be taking
your calls for her and we'll get her overview on the whole state of the world
itself but we just played that interview with a well-known survivor of Ceausescu's
Romania I mean they killed hundreds of thousands of people that was just a
small country but the example of his arrogance his corruption and the whole
apparatus and then finally people stood up with with people like Virginia Prodan
who's now fighting for our Second Amendment here she's a lawyer and a US
citizen just part of the American dream I can't wait to get her in studio with
us I can't wait to or maybe go interview her for the nightly news on camera just
amazing and we've also got David Ortiz's report coming up as well today and a
bunch of other reports there's just so many that are on the nightly news and I
really folks the quality of the nightly news the great reporters we were able to
find out there that love Liberty through the reporter contest that we did a year
ago the little less than a year ago everything is just so amazing and I'm
blessed and honored to be your host I'm very thankful that we're having these
huge breakthroughs I haven't really talked about it I mean that was a big
deal Michael Savage is not so much reclusive but he doesn't do a lot of
media and to get him on the air whether you agree with him or disagree it'll get
a lot of people awake he'll bring a lot of his listeners into this show and vice
versa to go on the Howard Stern show and they plan to have me wrong for 30
minutes and basically probably criticize me but I won him over with the facts and
then they had a vote I drove in this morning and heard the Howard Stern show
they said well we had the Howard fan club vote a record landslide for Alex
Jones is the most popular thing on yesterday's show it was like a 79% I
think the point is is that I give people like why would you go in the Howard
Stern show well because it's super pop culture and super big in Hollywood and
super big entertainment and if I can go on there and win those people over
because everything I talked about they're like wait I did hear about that
well I did just search that well that's true well that's crazy and I'm on there
saying don't drink the fluoride don't take the Prozac drugs don't eat the GMO
I mean it's a real public service announcement and the fact that by the
grace of God I'm able to get on the air with the facts just as I talk like a
regular person and I don't put on airs and I'm just a real warts and all that
I'm able to get through to people by the grace of God well so were you and just
as that lady the survivor of communist hardcore tyranny talked about how as
soon as she started standing up she couldn't believe the power she had
Virginia Prodan and how others ended up joining her who are the other Virginia
Prodans out there who are the other Alex Jones's who are the other Ron Paul's who
are the other dr. Catherine Alberdex who are the other people because I can tell
you something 20 years ago I was going to community college about to go to UT
and every class was anti-american anti-liberty classic tyranny and I went
to an access TV show 17 almost 18 years ago and had instant success reaching
people and got a radio show 17 years ago and the rest is history and I developed
my skills as I went along still I'm a train wreck many days but the point is
is that it's real it's resonating we can turn back the evil if you believe and
take action and don't stop we'll be back with dr. Catherine Alberdex in studio

ladies and gentlemen it is the 27th day of February 2013 on this Wednesday
edition we are now into the second hour Wow Howard Stern yesterday and they said
they had a record landslide vote of their Howard Stern fan club Howard Stern
TV members and 79% I was driving in this morning and heard it said that I was the
best part of the show and again you're like well that's a horrible vulgar
whatever show the point is the media listens it's very popular and that's how
we wake people up to the New World Order is by going out there and going on
Piers Morgan and going on Howard Stern show and talking to Robin and getting
Michael Savage on here this is the success of Liberty this is what we can
do expect to get more affiliates expect to win battles expected evil is not
invincible we heard a piece last night of a famous lady in Romania who fought
against Ceausescu and then got beat him in court got kicked out of the country
but but helped wake others up and she and others activities led to the final
overthrow of one of the most brutal dictators in the Soviet era there in
their satellites you are the resistance you have power most people that are part
of the corrupt system I've never thought about it they believe the false reasons
they've been given for it but as things get more oppressive as things get more
obvious and as things unfold that Catherine Albrecht and myself and Ron
Paul and she ever Griffin and countless others Bob Chapman the list goes on and
on as more and more of what we talk about manifest and people see the ugly
side of RFID or face scanning biometrics to buy and sell or drones or checkpoints
or arbitrary courts or the police state or psychotropic drugs as all this
manifest people are going to remember the seeds we planted today I can't tell
you how many times I plant wildflowers on my little nine acre plot of land
outside Austin and they sprout better the next year than the year I planted
them then because wildflowers kind of sprout when they like the weather and so
I planted stuff two years ago that just sprout is starting to sprout even better
than it did and I didn't plant this year we're having kind of an early hope it
isn't a fall spring it's the same thing it's like rocks in the pond has just
been said a billion times send out ripples forever keep throwing rocks in
the pond rocks in the pond ignore the enemy propaganda and understand that
we're going to take humanity back and that if you ask God to help you and just
trust in God as the last piece we air broke down that God will take you the
rest of the way and that even the bad things happen to you which usually don't
happen actually she was talking about how surprised she was lay that fought
that you shall chesque that that that it was the enemy that was scared it was the
system that freaked out that's why they tried to intimidate because they are the
ones that are afraid we don't need to be afraid of the new world order we need to
be afraid of not resisting them and letting them fully take over we can
control our own destiny with God's help now for this rest the hour and then 30
minutes into the hour after that speaking of an example of resistance dr.
Catherine Albrecht hosts syndicated radio program right here on the GCN
radio network the Catherine Albrecht show is a highly effective privacy

radio personality she has spearheaded the worldwide movement against RFID
tracking going all the world and implant technology since 2003 her unique brand
of knowledge coupled with her passion and truth for freedom have earned her a
devoted listening following and she also does great news vignettes
Catherine Albrecht.com, Spyships.com, WordPress.com, Catherine Albrecht.com and
she's here in Texas with a report we broke I don't know six months ago five
months ago whatever it was that then got into the news with the family where they
told the daughter you've got to wear an RFID ship even when you leave and go on
the school bus you have all the reports where they're watching kids on their
laptops at home court says that's okay big brother you know it's okay to have
cameras in the toilets it's okay to make people thumbprint to buy and sell the
banks are now demanding it what will they do once the casual societies in
turn off your thumbprint if you're not a good globalist they've said that a
no-fly list a no-gun buy list that's why this is so important add fees you got a
Bank of America card five dollars every time you use your money there was a
backlash today but Bank of America said we're getting with the other banks we're
gonna do it all together so you have nowhere to run and Catherine Albrecht
joins us to get into all of this and where we are today and to dovetail it
with this article for TV viewers you can see it here on the document cam
activists launch campaign against autonomous weapons killer robots must be
stopped now I've been saying this for 15 16 years when I read what MIT had planned
all Air Force will be drones all combat troops will be robots and a robot can be
a Humvee that is robotically controlled but also self you know self picking its
own targets autonomous as they call them with a large semi-auto or full-auto 50
cal missiles now I saw this 14 years ago at Urban Warfare drills and I talked to
Marines off-record including a colonel they were like listen Jones this is
nothing you ought to see what we've got this is 20 years old and I said well
what is it and they said well you've seen movies like this see movies like
that then I got in contact with some of them afterwards and they told me what
they'd seen just like those stealth helicopters you saw crash in the bin
Laden raid the so-called bin Laden raid yeah I mean that was like 30 year old
stuff folks they got stuff that will blow your mind and they want to roll it
all out because the automated system can just be programmed by the globalists and
forget the military saying no like Celsius goose people in Romania or
Operation Valkyrie when the German military tried to overthrow Hitler you
get rid of that when it's all the robots and with our tax money they're building
this technocracy that's really when I woke up Howard Stern yesterday and
Robin was I said you know bill joy wrote in Wired magazine the future doesn't
need us he went to an elite meeting they said they plan to get rid of the vast
majority of the public and that's in all the technocracy publications and
Howard's like well there are too many people I oh yeah but they're gonna get
rid of you too did you get a memo not to drink fluoride water no Howard you're
being targeted then see as soon as people get that doesn't matter you're
worth 300 million dollars Howard you're you're not in the top technocracy you
didn't ride eco science you don't get to go to moon base moonraker which is
really gonna be underground they're not going off world for this bioweapon
release you're dead you're dead Howard Stern Robin's dead I'm dead we're all
dead you better either wake up to this or it's all over I've seen their master
plan they've written it down they're arrogant about it now on the ground
fighting it everywhere actually they're focusing on this and it's important
whether you focus on everything like I do or you focus mainly on this and a
bunch of other subjects as she does his tertiary it's important to pick your
cross and carry it and it will empower you people think of fighting tyranny as
horrible it's the animating contest as Thomas Jefferson said okay that's my
introduction it was for the next hour and 20 minutes or so dr. Catherine
Albrecht what from Harvard degree and in your research of this tyranny first
time before we get into specifics what is the state of the globe the state of
the battle against the tyrants right now I'm going to tell you this whole move
towards getting people accepting what's happening in the last ten years has just
been mind-blowing it's to the point now where stuff that I used to be able to
talk about ten years ago that was you know I could say hey they're gonna start
tracking you through your shoes and people would go that's terrible let's
fight it nowadays and say they're gonna track you through your shoes and they
say yeah yeah they already tracked me through my cell phone they're tagging
kids now as you know it did Walt Disneyland while Disney World with the
RFID we're total conditioning on their right hand so now you've got kids going
you know the happiest place in the world the best event of my life I went to
Disneyland I got tagged with an RFID tag on my right wrist I'm going to associate
that now with fun so I think what's happening for from my perspective in the
battle is that it's getting harder to fight because it's getting harder for
people to actually recognize that there's a fight that needs to occur so
as these technologies move forward even they're in San Antonio at the schools a
lot of the parents say yeah I guess track my kid what's the big it's a normalcy
bias it is it's a Stockholm syndrome and it's new it's new this was not the case
ten years ago when I first started fighting RFID all I had to say was
they're gonna track you and people went ah we got to stop it now I said they're
gonna track you and they're like yeah and your point you know so it's like hey
the NSA is listening to you legally yeah hey they're torturing people including
their kids no you got to torture kids that's Christian it is it's like the
normalization of torture the normalization of the kinds of foods we
eat the normalization of the expectation we're all going to be sick and
chronically ill that that's just part of life my look congratulations beating
breast cancer thank you with God's help thank you absolutely that was quite how
is that going that's actually going really well and I'm gonna be starting a
new clinical trial at Cornell in New York with a woman who I actually believe
may have cured breast cancer well you know they've come up with a lot of cures
or treatments that are close to cures but they get shelved right the
establishment it's interesting because it's being run through Cornell which is
an actual academic university they're certainly in the in the inner circle if
you want to call it that but because the drug itself it's called tetra thioma
lib date it's a it's just an ammonium salt of molybdenum you know from the
periodic table it doesn't have any it doesn't have a patent on it there's no
pharmaceutical company making anything off of it it's cheap enough you could
salt the roads with it and it seems to prevent recurrence of breast cancer
well other cancers as well and she's not getting the big pharmaceutical you know
funding to do all the clinical trials but they're doing the trials anyway
funded by just donations so it is kind of fun to watch from within the inside
to see an alternative to see the life force still caring absolutely and and a
cure that's not gonna make anybody any money it's not gonna make anybody super
rich because there's no patent but there's the real wealth of your women in
your life not dying oh my goodness expanding on that why do you think from
your research breast cancers skyrocketing I think it's the estrogens
I think it's the fact that virtually everything we eat is in plastic the
printer ink bisphenol a the printer ink now it's gonna be in our in our dollar
bills they're gonna have the plastic carbonates everywhere I think we're just
drowning in estrogen except that's right they picked a bisphenol a to print the
plastic in the new dollar bills when there's no need it's just like here kill
yourself yeah well and you know as you point out with the water the things
they're adding to the water now they're finding that even the BPA free plastics
is I believe you've pointed out recently those BPA free plastics themselves now
are being shown to be highly estrogenic so it makes men lethargic fat and
unhealthy and makes women hyper feminized but accelerates the aging of
the tissues well and not just hyper feminized it causes cancer yeah it
triggers breast cancer I mean Catherine the government loves us you know the
good news Michael Savage was on and he said they're putting stuff in the water
and the food to do this to men and women I mean he's saying it the point is we're
reaching the point though where people admit it's going on next they'll be like
so the government's killing me that's loving we'll be right back with dr.

hey there my name is Frank Bates do you know the number one most valuable item
in a crisis some people think the answer is gold others think it's a gun but the
correct answer will shock you I just created a free video at crisis one two
three dot-com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in
a crisis ninety seven percent of Americans don't have this one critical
item in fact they haven't even given it a thought and the sad truth is that you
may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right
outside your door but I have to tell you could literally make the difference
between life and death for you and your family watch my video at crisis one two
three dot-com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis you'll be
shocked see the controversial video that thousands of other smart Patriots have
already seen in the last three months go watch my video now at crisis one two
three dot-com before they force me to shut it down again that's crisis one two

dr. Catherine Alberts our guest we are being inserted into the matrix the
children Catherine was just telling her in the break you know they have the new
children training bodies with a little insertion area for the iPad or iPod
people are just totally not you go out to restaurants now myself included no
one's even talking or communicating they're all clicking clicking clicking
that's why I've decided the next few weeks I'm gonna take off a full week
we're gonna have guest host you name it no computers I'm taking my wife and kids
to a cabin or something no computers no cell phones no nothing we've got to get
out of the matrix I mean I know all this and I can't stay out of it I want to get
into the specifics of the battle and what's happening but I mean what is
first and foremost on your radar Catherine right now in this fight to
expose that not technology is not bad but the way it's being deployed by the
technocrats is with Trojan horses for control and what from your research do
you think they're trying to build do you concur with my technocracy analysis I
do and and I of course add the the spiritual component that I believe that
what we're building is the body of the Beast Satan from the very beginning is
one of the powers of God the power to be omniscient to know everything about
everyone to be omnipotent to have the power to create and destroy life to
create and destroy worlds these are all things that you know as you look closer
at the battle you begin to recognize that it is a spiritual battle and I
believe that what we're creating with all of the surveillance all of the
cameras are you know the eyes of the Beast all of the microphones on the
buses and the microphones that they want to put into our homes they are the ears
of the Beast and ultimately you know we've created this web and you think
about the phrase web what is a web where there's a spider well call it the net
what is a net it's a trap so somewhere there is going to be a spider who's
gonna come and occupy this web that we've created and it will have reached
its tentacles into every aspect of our lives at that point so you know it's
almost like sensing like you've got the the Calistoga wagons and and everybody's
just out there camping and having a great time but you don't realize they're
being surrounded by the enemies all around and there comes a moment when
they're just gonna leap out and say we're gonna pull the noose now so they
already are they're already saying no judge no jury can on a gun veteran you're
in a technocracy now face scan to buy and sell it's all going in right now the
spider is already sitting there it's a eugenics based worldwide
extermination grid and I've studied the elite they happen to be Luciferians
you're right there's a giant murderous blood-drinking spider that worships
Lucifer mm-hmm then I guess it's called the Beast and its eyes it's it's
compound eyes are just everywhere and it's growing more of them and now it's
launching in the sea the air it's smart dust you know the companies themselves
talk about this and people say Oh Catherine she's just this Christian and
you know you don't have to listen to that much of this comes from the other
side although they say it will achieve consciousness and then we the elect will
merge with it yes absolutely they they are the ones giving it this religious
spin they're the high priests that plan on climbing into it as if it's gonna let
them climb into it exactly and you've got now Ray Kurzweil who is the head of
engineering now for Google he's the guy who looks forward to the singularity
when we actually merge with these machines and he says we're like bugs he
says we're like bugs and if you don't merge with the cybernetic system well
it's like stepping on a bug my goodness all right well and what they're aiming
for and again taking it back to this idea that Satan wants the powers of God
it's a form of immortality which I believe is hell it's this idea that you
will be able to live forever upload your soul take your consciousness out of this
meat package that you call about uploaded into the beast and upload it
into the computer network into Satan's mind so you can live forever and you
know you you look at the people who fall down the rat hole for example of World
of Warcraft you know who are so immersed in that world that their real world
their bodies go to hell they're not healthy they lose their relationships
they lose their jobs because they're immersed in something that's just in
their heads who was that lady you had on the research you're talking about what
the video games are doing to people I've had a number of maybe we should try have
you talk about that fascinating stuff that's happening with the video games
because these men don't want to be with their wives the women don't they just
your people die playing video games for like three days straight they do
especially over in China they've now you'll love this one Alex because talk
about tyranny the government in China now is supervising people's use of the
internet because they have all these online interactive games and if you play
more than four hours in China they actually begin removing the
characteristics of your of your character so your character starts getting weaker
and slower and they take away gold and it is weapons don't fire anymore so the
Chinese government is actually observing people's because they want to keep their
biological androids functioning well but as they build the computers you heard at
Foxconn when the humans were all committing suicide last year they said
we're gonna go to robots they tried robots they're still not ready show
there believe me once they're ready to kill them they'll turn on the video
games that are so addicting people are gonna sit there till they die they
already have the flicker algorithm and then everyone will just die and then the
robots replaces well and what's what's if you try this in with Ray Kurzweil's
vision it's that we would voluntarily because the world is going to become so
polluted because our bodies will be so chronically broken because there will no
longer be any butterflies or trees or flowers or plants because everything is
gonna be dark and burned out you're going to at that point want to upload
yourself into the beautiful forest in the in the video game and that's why
they're trying to wreck the world on purpose while claiming their
environmentalist and then having the seed arcs and vaults because they plan
on destroying it but then Lucifer will remake it beautiful he's just destroying
it to rebuild it Oh Lucifer we'll be right back we're on the march the
Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network your freedoms are on
the line the Second Amendment is in danger how soon before your freedoms are

turning away from the pale and downtrodden and the words they say which
we won't understand don't accept what's happening it's just a case of all the
suffering oh you find that you're joining in that's right when you go
along with evil and corruption and don't at least recognize it you're turning
away it's a sin and you're allowing everything to rot around you a nightmare
world is being built and the middle of it is a wicked anti-human technocratic
spider the elites call themselves this not just Ray Kurzweil yeah they had a
technology at Google all of them we have their quotes in in-game blueprint for
global enslavement and I love that the New York Times a few years ago talked
about in-game and it was back when they were saying there was no Bilderberg and
Obama and Hillary didn't meet Chantilly even though it was all on record later
and they said that Jones believes the elite are going to merge with machines
and fly around the solar system I was quoting Ray Kurzweil I was quote and it
said in the film where they said it it's on record and and technocrats saying we
may just blow the earth up for the power you know just because we want to
exercise the power all this crazy stuff and Kurzweil goes and has events with
all the top Hollywood William Shatner who's a nice guy but well he wants to
live forever he says it and they offer him you're gonna live forever you're
gonna live forever this is how you do it and then we're just accepting their plan
of how we're going to quote evolve and then I look at everything else they do
it actually is devolving us now Catherine I've been we've had some nice
banter for a few segments of some great back and forth but I want to get back
into at the core of your research what they're building who they are the
spiritual side where because they say it's spiritual Ray Kurzweil said he
doesn't believe in God yet they will become God that's a quote yeah yeah
merging with the machine so so you've got the floor I'm gonna I'm gonna sit
back yeah when when when you think about just biblically and a lot of what you're
saying is about come out you know in Revelation we're actually told and also
in Daniel the two prophetic books in the Bible come out come out of Babylon that
that there's gonna come a time when it's going to become so corrupt that if you
stay in you will either become a part of the problem or you will become become
completely corrupted and destroyed so you know come out of her my people lest
you be partakers of her sins and receivers of her plagues and so we know
we can look around and you can see it happening and what's interesting now I
was saying it's it's a more frustrating battle now than it was ten years ago
because people don't get what what it is that we're fighting or why you would
even bother fighting against it but in a way it's also an easier battle because
what I've found is that even when I'm sitting on an airplane if I start
talking about these issues with people and talk about how the world's going in
the wrong direction everybody nods and says yeah I feel it too you know that
there's something coming for us everybody has this feeling of almost a
predator after the prey and I think we're all because Sarah is warning we're
feeling this sense the the the get out to run something's coming spirit
everyone's feeling it and in that sense I think in a course ever since my cancer
battle I don't know how many more years I'll even be here so I've been much more
open about sharing what what I believe is the real endgame what's really did
that boost your discernment facing death absolutely oh my gosh it put me in a
completely different place I was just speaking to a wonderful friend last
night who was helping out here as I'm as I'm traveling around and saying for the
first time in my life I actually feel wise I feel that I've gained some wisdom
from that and that's been just an incredible incredible positive journey I
never thought I'd say thank you that I had cancer but I think that I am
actually grateful for what I would accepting death is a real booster in in
discernment because then you don't have all the petty things blocking your your
your spiritual vision anymore well and I think also that's the stuff I used to
think mattered you know being respected or testifying for the Federal Trade
Commission or having the governor appoint me as the expert member of the
study Commission on RFID all of those those accolades that the world gives you
all of that recognition that I used to really crave and think was so important
and I have to say this point you know because I kept my mouth shut I didn't
really say what I thought was actually happening I kept my Christian views to
myself I kept my spiritual views under wraps because you can't go saying that
and then expect that the Federal Trade Commissioners take you seriously but
since having cancer I have really come to the point where I say what I know and
I mean what I say and I don't really care if people agree or disagree at this
point so it's a new place and it's a good place and you're free I'd like for
us to become that way a little bit more you're free so so so get into get into
the nature of it get get into the technocracy and we'll get into specifics
how it's working but let me get into the big picture because that was when you
talk to when you look at what IBM talks about and I fly a lot so I've gone
through a lot of airports and they've got this big smarter planet you know up
on all the the airports up high they've got all these billboards I must cost
them millions to put all this up about the smarter planet and the smarter
planets built on RFID it's built on all of the sensor network and they talk
about the planetary skin that the actual planet will develop a skin and be able
to sense everything that occurs on it the Internet of Things which is the RFID
network that I've been fighting all these years the Internet of Things is
the idea that every physical object would be reporting home to the global
brain that you would have this this consciousness that would be aware of
everything every tree in every forest every frog in every pond every move that
you make every piece of paper you pick up all of it would be monitored and
observed by this centralized brain and the way they're going to do it is
through the RFID system so somehow they're going to put and and they've
been talking about this since 2003 put tiny sensors on every physical object
build it right into every physical object on the globe so that as the the
thing begins to as the consciousness sort of comes in and occupies the
infrastructure that's been built for it that consciousness will use those as
sort of nerve endings to know everything and the scariest thing that I think I've
heard all year is the spray-on nanotechnology antennas so there is a
company they're called I want to say cam tech CHM or so run drones with yeah so
what this is actually a different one this is a this is a surveillance
technology or an antenna technology so let's say for example Alex right now
that everything in this room had an RFID tag or your shirt your underwear my top
might you know my shoes whatever had an RFID tag and we went out into the woods
we couldn't be tracked there it is because there's no reader there you go
that's it spray-on antenna wireless in a can so what these guys have developed
and if you scroll down you'll see a picture of a tree all right see that
tree there it'd be great if you could zoom in and see that it just looks like
a regular tree so there are military antennas that cost a fortune and they
lug them out into Afghanistan so that they can transmit to airplanes or to
base stations what they can do now is take this brand antenna spray it on the
tree and the tree itself becomes the antenna that broadcast and transmits you
could do this to every tree in the forest and now you and I are walking
through the woods and the trees are actually monitoring us and they have a
range these trees can send to a passing airplane and eventually they will be
able to transmit to satellites so what this is done is it's taken the RFID
thing that I've been working on all these years and the piece I've been
working on is they want to put the chips on everything but the real issue is where
are the readers and once you can do this you can actually you could you could
spray the wall you could paint the walls with this you could cover every surface
on planet Earth smart dust and track everything all the time well the dust is
the trackable part these are the receivers keep going anything you can
paint with this technology anything you can paint with this would be capable of
picking up all of your signals and emissions you know Clifford Carnicom
just interrupt I have to I can't help it Clifford Carnicom told me like 13 years
ago on air and of course he worked I think was the forest service he wouldn't
say everything off air and then he wouldn't go back on shows anymore he
couldn't disappear I guess because of threats is what I heard he said they're
spraying the aluminum dioxide to get into the trees and they're gonna drop
some type of other reading substance on it later but that's all I was told and
he had like Department of Energy sources and I heard that I thought that's a
little out there and then it just clicked when you were saying that I'm
sorry go ahead so yeah it would be possible you could you could fly over a
forest of trees with this dust and turn your trees into antennas they'd be
broadcasting up to space so and the problem with this is is invisible you
would never know that this paint was even underneath the wall paint of a room
that you were in and then that room could become an actual sort of RFID
chamber picking up all these signals so when when we're talking about this this
this web and something shocked me the other day it was the realization that
we've only had iPhones since 2006 or 2007 I want to say was 2007 that that
was introduced can you believe that it's only been six years that this technology
came and they're ubiquitous it's like part of your body everyone is staring
into the device and clicking and thumbing and and and if you don't have
one you're behind the times this is a six-year-old technology Alex and so now
you say well if we've all we're all carrying around now our unique sort of
global brain connectors because we're checking into this thing that's linking
us to the global brain and now all they have to do is build the remainder of the
infrastructure and it's done and then launch the drones to kill us no there's
many ways they can kill us drones are just one and that's why Bill joy I go
back to that a thousand times right why the future doesn't need us back in 2000
April and he said I went to an elite conference with other billionaires and
we said do we kill everybody or just let people play video games and have a good
time and the answer was that's bad for the earth we're gonna kill everybody and
then their answer is we tell you we're gonna kill you and you don't care well
you know what I care and you care yeah and one of the ways that they're killing
people and I've observed this if you go into even just a standard supermarket
and you look at the extra-large tub of peanut butter versus the little small
thing of peanut butter the extra-large tub of peanut butter which is meant for
the big prodigious families contains horrible ingredients that aren't in the
small container I've been noticing this lately that the bulk can tell you know
the text the technocracy admits they've done that for themselves as escape doors
absolutely as they shut it down the eugenicists are now discovering first it
was 80% they were gonna kill then it was 90% their literature now they're going
actually we're gonna kill 99% and so the people that are part of it are begging
what do I do to be part of that and this is a whole cult where they get off I'll
see him out in public I'll go you're a professor aren't you and you're you
Jenna said I'm not talking to you Jones this happened two weeks ago in a coffee
shop cuz I could tell the guy was looking at me going oh yeah now what you
feel powerful cuz you're in on this he was like get away from me but I mean the
point is they're out there like a cult it's like body snatchers yeah and even
Nancy Pelosi what was the first thing she did when she got elected to Congress
she redid the congressional dining hall to be all organic food and to get rid of
all of the the hyper Monsanto the communist Chinese all the elites are
obsessed but listen you're asking me questions keep rolling with all these
points you know it's it's absolutely the elite if you want to call him that I
call him the pond scum they're the people who think they're the cream that
has risen to the top of the milk but they're really they're the fools that
think they won't reap what they sow they're the fools think that they can do
evil and get away with it well and they view themselves and I know this because
yeah I went to Harvard and I go to a lot of these meetings and a lot of these
government meetings and such and they really do view themselves as being
smarter than everybody else and and really being in a position to kind of
direct everyone else's lives so you know the pond scum the algae that chokes out
the oxygen for for all the rest of us this really is is their view and they
have built escape hatches they don't send their kids to government schools
they send their kids to elite prep schools with armed guards with armed
guards and they don't eat the food that they expect the rest of us to eat one of
my favorite stories was when John Kerry was doing a promotional you know smile
and greet at Wendy's restaurant and there he was he's shaking hands with the
person in the Wendy's apron whatever and they put the food in front of him and he
wouldn't touch it wouldn't touch it wouldn't put a bite in his mouth and
then afterwards this got written up because they said oh he's an elitist
because afterwards he went out and got into his little mobile van and the local
country club brought him a four course meal but the fact that he wouldn't even
put it to his lips you would think at least for a photo opportunity one he
didn't want you know that the journalists were watching you the
cameras were on you he'd at least take a bite but he didn't even touch it and
who's he married to Teresa Heinz kinds of Heinz and what is Heinz do they're
part of the whole system that provides the food and they're all eugenicists you
can take any of these people and research what they give money to is
their charity stuff is public it's all the eugenics groups whenever the
Secretary of Treasury got like 200 million dollars himself of a bailout
money and got the waiver from himself to do it they went and looked and he gave
like half the money to eugenics organizations I mean they are dedicated
to this well did you hear about Zuckerberg giving money to the life
extension group yeah no this is their deal those are the folks who want to
live forever because that's the animating spirit behind all of this
there's an animating spirit that was put in motion way back in the Garden of
Eden you know what was the promise that the serpent made to Eve I'll make you
God you will have the power you will have the knowledge of good and evil and
of course God said well if you do that you'll surely die and he meant if you
bite into the apple and embrace the technology the knowledge that's gonna
come from that your whole species is gonna die he didn't mean Adam and Eve
right then he meant your entire community of the future is if you become
because Satan can't create he has to use God's creations made in the image of the
Creator the devil isn't creative he is literally using us to build his master
temple indeed and that's really how I view it and I I've been asked before the
people who are developing these technologies so they sit around and
worship black candles and have pentagrams and of course you've you've
exposed that some of them do but in my experience many of them are just day to
day trying to pay their bills trying to pay their mortgage yeah but at the very
top they don't worship the devil they worship they worship the the beautiful
white angel and and they believe and they believe there's Lucifer but they
see it as the angel of light yeah and that no Lucifer is really God and and
this is a bad creation we've got to do this to save the earth and they'll work
20 hours a day to bring Lucifer in and then you look at the fruit of it though
because the Bible tell no I agree it's horrible judge a tree by its fruit and
so you can say what is the fruit and I challenge anyone out there to name a
technology that's really gotten a hold that that doesn't have a downside you
know we we open our books by chips talking about we have a quote from CP
snow a New York Times journalist and he says technology is a queer thing it
gives you great gifts with one hand and it stabs you in the back with the other
and it really does feel that way you look at everything from pesticides you
know our grandparents thought in the 50s that better living through chemistry
that was gonna save us who's gonna eradicate the mosquitoes with DDT and
look at the outcome of that we don't have birds we're gonna butterflies we
don't have diversity we and we're not living as long as we used to wait we
have Monsanto exactly so you tie all that in what did what did the
pesticides lead to well they led to the the rise of Monsanto and this is all
just the launch pad the reason people are freaking out is the new age and not
the one that people talk about that the the new technological hyper dark age
where it's a technocracy dark age against the spirit it's here and
everything we've seen built up we're now at the edge of the cliff now the real
plunge is about to happen that's why everybody's like because because deep
down the spirits going mayday people feel it they absolutely feel it and
that's why when whenever somebody says well why are you fighting this you know
if it's inevitable if you've got your biblical beliefs why would you fight
against it it's gonna happen and my response to that is we're not gonna stop
it I mean as much as I hate to say that I feel like the the years that I've
battled the last 13 years that I fought against RFID and all these privacy
invading technologies it's like there's been a mudslide coming down the hill and
I stood and I held my ground with my piece of plywood and I held firm ground
but it just went around me it's coming anyway so we can hold our little pieces
and I encourage everybody to do that because the longer we can hold a space
for for our family for our children for the future for posterity the better and
the more people we can inform but ultimately this stuff is going to be a
mudslide rolling down the hill and the real answer to that then is the same
answer back in the Garden of Eden IV West is being like the crew of the
Titanic we struck an iceberg way back when you've been into that Apple we've
been taking on water ever since the ship is going down and we're not gonna stop
it but when you look at the actual Titanic the reason so many people drown
do you know that those lifeboats were half empty they didn't they hadn't
trained they didn't know and they told the poor stay down there while the elite
went to the escape hatch they did that's why the Patriots need to move in life
boats right now absolutely long before everybody else does the elites have
already moved to the country and move the middle of nowhere with armed guards
whoever can even you've got to get ready folks and I think a big part of that too
is the job that you and I do which is a job of sounding the alarm because the
the crew on the Titanic didn't do a very good job did they because people kept
dancing they didn't want to jump out into the dark cold in a boat they were
in denial it was a great example of learned helplessness or denial about a
situation you're in but this ship couldn't possibly sink what the lights
are on the music is playing and I think a lot of people still have that attitude
today look I saw my video game and I'm like cancer is up 3,000% they're like
nevermind and we'll be right back incredible stay with us your freedoms

I'm the voice saying I'm not going along with the tyranny I'm the voice you're
the voice saying no to the technocrats that we see through their agenda they
don't want our guns to help the kids they want our guns to enslave us they
don't want us eating GMO so we live longer in all the studies it kills the
rats we know what it's doing to us we know what their technocratic plan is
total world government where they kill us and they live forever there are a
bunch of delusional crazies that have seized the human brain trust and use it
to take over the world and I want to say something we're gonna talk about this in
the next hour through this the whole next hour and we'll take calls the last
30 minutes because this is a powerful interview with dr. Catherine Albrecht
here in studio with a syndicated host best-selling author researcher recently
has cancer in remission I need to pray for she's gonna get scanned again soon
to see if there's any metastasization so again pray for her pray for everybody
pray for Liberty pray for me I certainly need it as well all the stuff going on
around here we wouldn't be around if it wasn't for the prayer we don't just you
know believe in prayer we we rely on it but I just wanted to point out here
before we go back to her that she's got some big news in the next hour about
organizing against the chipping of the kids and they're even going for
implanted chips and the dogs then the kids forcibly she's been to Washington
been fighting for that that even if biblically this stuff's gonna come in
and what it doesn't make you believe the Bible is everything it says coming
through thousands of years ago it's the journey of warning people so that with
the critical time they'll recognize it once it's even in this is the soul that
matters and then what and then defeating it after that the Beast comes in but
then it only rains for a short time it's gonna be hellish but how many people is
a Bible saves gonna end up is it two-thirds a third how many people in
revelations get killed it's a large amount I mean only only nanotech could
make the ocean completely die I mean folks again you better hope the Bible's
wrong ladies and gentlemen I don't mean what the fake preachers are preaching

Catherine and we're going to come back with all the big news and specifics of
the technocratic takeover and why even the elites are talking about a robot
takeover which they command of course taking human will out of it they believe
and why it's so important to keep the guns for defense against that because
there's going to be major resistance to this planetary wide and the Bible says
we get biblical that they'll also be remnant areas and protected areas and I
believe Texas is going to be one of those areas I mean a pastor David J
Smith you know said the praying to God like 30 years ago he was told move to
Texas this is all going to happen and it was I mean the point is is that you've

Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
Alex Jones
well she's here in studio with us and we're talking about the biggest issue
out there what is the technocratic architecture of the technocracy that the
globalists admit they're building and every book they've written every
publication every transcript it's just nightmare how there will be world
government by 2020 there will not even be families men and women anymore you
will merge or you will not be part of the collective we might let you live in
ghettos and then you see planned Opelis videos they show kids in Britain where
it shows that future I mean it is a prison planet that's why I call it
prison planet calm doc we're gonna go to break this is a short kind of no-man's
land segment but what are you gonna be covering throughout the rest of the hour
before we take calls well I want to talk about the fight that we've mounted in
San Antonio against the radio tracking beacons around children's necks that's
that's got to be one of the worst things that I've seen we'll cover that next and
also what's coming up in DC talking about what's going on in DC the
coalition that's been put together to fight back against that and I've also
got some news from start page and we got a good stuff going on and I want to get
also into just some of the other technologies coming in there are a lot
of them and I think what I'm seeing now is the convergence of not just the
technology but the mindset because I'm sure you have listeners right now
listening to this program who if I told them hey listen your cell phone is
tracking you they would say yeah well you know what can we do it is what it is
you know so even people who know who love liberty even people who know what's
coming even people who want to fight it are starting to feel that there's really
nothing we can do about it that it's they think there's a power into just
saying so what yeah yeah exactly that they're that's perfectly put there's
almost a sense of empowerment of I'm not gonna let it scare me I'm just gonna
accept it and I think that that is not gonna let it scare me that the GMO kills
mammals that eat it here a two-year-old my son had the food yeah it's playing
right into the your ten-year-old has cancer well that's it you know that all
the crying and all the I'll go on a jog to get the cure no no they're you know
they killed your son they killed your daughter and then now you're gonna go
jog to collect money for them yeah so it does play directly into that and you
were asking about what is it that's causing all the breast cancer I think
it's also the same thing that's causing all the gender confusion because when
you have all these estrogenics in the food in the pesticides in the genetically
modified stuff then you wind up with gender confusion you wind up with it
like this guy in Japan who removed his own genitalia and served it in a
banquet because he didn't want to identify with being male or female he
just wanted to chop it look at Japan has like 1.2 kids for every adult for every
of the two men and women and now the new chic thing is adult diapers because
it's so trendy to poop your pants I'm sorry to say that from a lady but Japan
is a very odd did you see that record adult diapers now outstrip child yeah I
I don't know and then I saw it thought oh that's an old population and no it
says in the Bloomberg article that it's like really trendy yeah and Japan is has
a lot of perversity behind the scenes I actually studied Japanese for two years
in school I didn't know and I spent some time over in Japan in Tokyo and I had a
horrific experience when I was in Japan I was in a bathroom stall at a train
station and someone my boyfriend was outside and saw a drunken guy wander
into the bathroom this guy jumped up over the stall with a camera and took a
photo of me and then ran out and that you can buy publications available on
the street corners of magazines full of that kind of sick thing and you think
now this was years ago you think now what could they do with today's
technology in Japan what could they do with today's technology anywhere they
have those cameras hidden in any well the court ruled that public schools can
watch your kids undress with laptops at home well and that's totally illegal and
Big Brother Watch just finished telling us that over in England now they're
finding that the schools are installing video cameras in the changing rooms and
in the bathroom stalls and they tell and they tell the kids also thumbprint like
007 and biometrics don't tell mommy and daddy you're now 007 it's all about
breaking that the family that your family's not your family the state is
and that's what Hitler did of course he said I don't care about you guys I want
your kids it's your kids I want it's their kids I want I remember 12 years ago when I caught
bribes or 13 years ago at the Capitol the head of the group said we don't care
we'll get your guns we've got your kids to the newspaper we've got your kids I
mean these are evil degenerates we've got your kids homeschool your freedoms
are on the line the Second Amendment is in danger how soon before your freedoms
are taken away what can you not live without what is your greatest dependency
is it your guns is it your home no it's food it all boils down to the food

calling 888-253-3139 waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you
live from the front lines of the info war escape from the technocracy escape
from the New World Order for me when I realized there's a scientific group of
authoritarians wanting to take over the planet I learned this 20 years ago I was
like I want to fight these people and look what I've been able to do and I'm
just an average person but it's a normal response for a man or a woman learning
that a horrible world is being created to want to change that and I think it's
the difference between being a spectator and being someone active in the world
and Catherine were talking during the break about people that think it's
winning to just give in and that is that is not the case now now there's a bunch
of stuff we're gonna get into the coalition you're forming to fight the
RFID of the kids in school with the tracker systems we're gonna take phone
calls we're gonna get into a host of other really important issues but you
said you wanted to talk about Piers Morgan I did actually and you know a lot
of people have said well what in the world happened when Alex Jones went on
Piers Morgan and I said it probably one of the most powerful things that's ever
occurred and let me tell you why because Alex the people that were fighting they
don't respond to us showing a belly and rolling over and and and and saying oh
yes I'm defenseless they respond to being afraid so you know it's the same
idea when the people fear their government we have you know when people
for their government you have tyranny when the government fears the people you
have liberty the when I thought when I saw you on Piers Morgan you know what I
thought of I thought of Afghanistan and let me tell you why when the u.s. I
protested this war when the u.s. decided to go into Afghanistan I'm no military
strategist I knew that was going to be idiotic why because everybody who has
ever tangled with Afghanistan has absolutely gotten their butt kicked
everybody so the Soviets went in with all of their Cold War technology couldn't
touch Afghanistan everybody who's gone in there has gotten absolutely reamed
and we're getting reamed over there too those people are tough they're bad as
in badass well they just won't give up yes and so when you know that if you
tangle with them you're gonna get in trouble and it's not gonna come out well
for you and that was exactly the sense that I had with you on Piers Morgan was
that the people who want to take away our guns who want to take away my gun I
own guns those people taking a look at you are gonna say you know what I don't
know if it's gonna be safe to try to take those guns away so I want to thank
you and I you know I'm no big fan of the people of Afghanistan I mean I I actually
do admire their their moxie sure my are their ability to fight back I admire
their tenacity but I have to say that there are some certain people you don't
want to tangle with well well you're nice to say that I mean the Lord works
mysterious ways it's been said they begged me to go up there I said okay
I'll do it in studio that way they couldn't cut me off and stuff and I just
so happened to get sick that day going and was hacking and coughing and had a
stomachache and you know I don't want to get into it on air but you know threw up
a little bit and that's why I blew up at the TSA because when I get sick and I'm
made to get up out of a bed I'm in a bad mood and then I blew up at him because
he was sniveling I know he wants my guns on record acting like he doesn't oh
we're just being reasonable I'm like look you want my guns it's gonna cause a
civil war because it is going to cause a civil war and I've had sheriff's and
police chiefs and internal West Point documents that are now out say they'll
be a civil war there will be so don't act like there's not gonna be a civil
war and listen Pierce when the civil war starts you're an enemy redcoat so I was
there just saying look stop playing games here I know and I was intending to
say it nicer but because I was sick and I guess it was a scene me and they're
sweating and all the rest of it I think it did get the message and notice they
said oh it was discrediting for us no they want us in a coma and I'm not and
I'm not just putting persim on a pig this resonated and that's why they said
they won't have me back on as I ran back into him in Houston and his producers I
went down there to cover when he was down there a few weeks ago they said oh
we gave you too much attention we're not doing it no that event got a lot of
attention and had people go at first because they're in a coma they're in a
trance oh my gosh that's so mean sounding that's so angry that guy but
but then I said America why are you upset by somebody saying don't take my
rights when Paul Revere didn't just yell he said get your guns and kill people
and oh he's a founding father I'm just saying hey watch it buddy don't you try
to take our Second Amendment how do we get so gelded so conditioned that that
was alien and so at first it was uncomfortable to get woke up from a
sleep but then people went like a day later including family wait this makes
perfect sense so it was almost a trance breaking thing a lot of media analysts I
talked to and also some people like Billy Corrigan and Smashing Pumpkins sent
me a text right after it he said you just broke the trance huge and he's a
really smart guy but I heard that from other media analysts you name it they
said no it was a famous event in American TV history because it was
almost like Howard Beale getting off script anyways I'm ranting I agree
entirely and you know it kind of gets back to what I was saying about after
cancer I just say what I know you know I'm sure a lot of people watch that and
they didn't like you very much and you know what they shouldn't the people who
want to take away our guns shouldn't like us they should be afraid of us they
should be uncomfortable in our presence they should bow and kneel before us
because they're our servants and I actually as a woman I'm in no position
to get out there and yell in their faces that's not my role it's not that's not
who I am or how I am but I gotta tell you I am very glad that you are standing
between me and them well you're very sweet but as a woman you're out there
fighting the global it's really hard my only issue is it is men's main job to
stand up to usurpers and men aren't doing that it is a usurpation our
ancestors started a war with the greatest empire the world had ever seen
that lasted six years and killed hundreds of thousands over this amen and
then it is and and it is the role of real men and that's one of the reasons
why you can't even buy a sandwich down the street without there being soy soy
bean oil in the mayonnaise because what is so I do we have study after study
after study showing that it emasculates men it reduces testosterone levels one
of the reasons why in the prisons they feed soy to the prison inmates is
because it makes them docile it turns them into domesticated I heard the
guests you had about the medical problems it's causing immense incredible
that was Sally Fallon from nurturing tradition she's actually got a lawsuit
against I believe the Ohio prison system because they're feeding those prison
inmates up to 70 grams of protein soy protein a day and it is it's destroying
their health it's giving them leaky gut syndrome holes in their stomach they've
got chronic health problems joint issues you name it and it's not only that but
the real issue the real reason they're feeding everybody soy is because they
want to emasculate them in well the social engineers call us animals and
we're like wild pigs to them that they're feeding poison to and then we
just run up and do it and we run off and and you know we know the system is bad
but we still come up and eat their food and you know while we're looking around
like a pig I mean think about that we got scientists writing white papers
about how we're animals and how they're poisoning us yeah I mean I have John P
Holdren's book right there I mean that's war he should be in prison you know
there's a guy named Dwayne Andreas who was featured in the movie the informant
a couple years back and Dwayne Andreas is the head of Archer Daniels Midland
you know you always hear they find NPR and you hear their names all the time
Dwayne Andreas is known as the soybean King because he took soy which was not a
human food in fact people didn't even feed it to their animals because it was
toxic it was silage they used it just for the hay and he turned soy into a
human food by flying all over the world he's known if you look up on Wikipedia
Dwayne Andreas is known as the number one political donor in all of history of
the 20th century he has like a life-size bronze statue of Ronald Reagan to get
Ronald Reagan on board he traveled in and visited with Castro and visited
with the the Kremlin and went behind the Iron Curtain all through the 60s 70s and
80s and got all of those countries to introduce soybean oil as the key number
one oil being consumed and that was the dream of Henry Ford who was a eugenicist
well it was prior to that and you can look this up they couldn't give it away
they could not give it away soybean oil is used for making paint it was not food
it's never been food but what they discovered is that if they could take
this soybean oil which can be cheaply produced and get it out in mass to the
people obviously it starts having a huge impact on fertility I blogged about this
they've done studies where where boys exploit exposed to soy the little tubules
that do all the stuff testosterone and all of that they don't form properly so
that's why we're seeing these these hamsters if you feed them soy they
actually their testicles shrivel up after three generations and they are
infertile they literally can't procreate and they have hair on their tongue and
they do and giant tumors absolutely but that's loving well you know and and the
women they they have difficulty bringing their babies to full term so this is the
you know the baby hamsters I'm sure it's happening to women as well and so what
are we seeing this huge explosion of gender confusion and now they're saying
you shouldn't be able to eat beef or poultry go to soy it's humane yeah and
the school lunch programs you know Michelle Obama eat your soy yeah and
it's it's genetically modified in the first place but even if you eat organic
soy it's not good for you it's one of the most highly estrogenic things you
can eat Sally Phelan has some amazing research up on her website points to
studies that show that if you feed a baby an infant soy formula that that
baby is receiving as much hormone as if you were giving that baby a birth
control pill that's immense amount totally fries them well listen I look at
photos people in the 50s 60s 70s 80s they look totally different I was
reading where people even eat less calories today than they used to 50
years ago but it's all it's about cut calories now instead of like what are
the calories exactly and it's never why is everybody getting breast cancer it's
find the cure because they're doing it to us I mean they allow McDonald's to
feed us plastic in the chicken McNuggets silica and now aspartame in the milk you
know it's it's and not tell us and and what's even more interesting is why is
there this pathological desire I know here in Austin they just had a hearing
this morning on the organic milk issue the raw milk issue why is it why are
they so pathologically determined to ensure that we don't have alternative
because it's a super food to make sure that we cannot go out onto our own
property it's going to come to the point I guarantee you Alex where you're going
to need a permit to put a seed in the ground oh no they're already trying it
and all over the country well you're not going to be able to grow your own food
your own garden you're not going to be used to Monsanto once that I just sued
400 more farmers where their stuff infects you you have a record of the
seeds you bought not from them they can go find where because plants aren't one
daddy one mommy that if it's 1% a Monsanto plant from pollen that blew in
the court rules that they run and now they're saying how about everyone just
has to get inspected or a license to grow anything yeah I mean they I mean
what will we not put up with invasive species there are now regulations about
transporting seeds across state lines because you might transport in some
invasive species they now have satellite programs that based on the color of the
crops can identify whether it's oh yeah no no no they're already using the

I want you to tell the Noah Hutchins story one of the first people to ever
surveil with aircraft in the u.s. you know he exposes it 90 years old but you
also mentioned this and here's the Wall Street Journal for radio listeners how
the insurer knows you just stocked up on ice cream and beer and we told you this
under the socialist health care written by the insurance companies fascist prop
profit but socialist control over you they will know everything you eat
everything you do off the store loyalty cards or even off the credit card with a
data mining tied to your name and Catherine I talked about this you talked
about this more than a decade ago and now they're just flaunting that what you
buy is given to your insurance company no judge no jury no contract you sign
that's why they get so mad when you pay with cash but we'll get to that first
get into the Noah Hutchinson story and then I'll give the number up yes so Noah
Hutchins during during the Great Depression he was I think was 15 or 16
and everybody needed a job so he lied about his age he tells the story which I
think is interesting is now you never get away with this but lied about his
age and got a job flying aircraft and going out to all of the farmers lands to
ensure that they weren't planning crops so when this was an era and it still
blows my mind to this day that they were burning hundreds of bushels of thousands
hundreds of thousands of bushels of corn and wheat and things that farmers had
grown in an effort to try to create a shortage to drive the price up and one
of the things that they would do is they would say if you agree to let your land
lie fallow not plant anything we'll pay you X amount per acre to plant nothing
and so some of the farmers said well forget that it's my land I want to grow
crops at least for my own family and Noah's job back then which he now
regrets he can tell you the story but this is back in what the 1930s is he
would drive out in a pickup truck to these properties and what the farmers
would meet him with a shotgun at the gate said you can't come on the property
and say well I'm with the government I've got to inspect to see if you're
growing food and they would say no you can't come on the property so then they
put him in an airplane and he would fly literally the very first aerial
surveillance used by the government in this country was used to see if people
were growing food on their own property you can tell the story it's amazing and
that's what they're doing now this whole police state control grid the Pentagon
Northcom is you know we have a old family ranch we don't even really hunt
on it much but you know every once in a while at the first day of deer season if
you happen to be there you know the game warden will pull in or whatever and now
it's just like you know seven eight nine ten fifteen people will show up and just
start demanding get in that truck getting that we don't need warrants
we're God we're under a federal task force and it's but meanwhile the
borders are wide open the government shipping and the drugs but it's all
about government like bugging their eyes out at you like it's our country now boy
and the idea now is how many places can you put the eyeballs so we've already
got the satellite imagery watching you now we've got the drones that can fly
over we've got the you know little dragonflies of the camera in their nose
that can fly around your property and eventually they want to do these these
antenna trees and and put surveillance devices on literally everything in your
to read the smart dust yeah and then bathe everything in RF yes and there is
we actually saw when we were researching spy chips Liz and I came across a plan
to put an RFID tag in every single tree on earth they actually calculated the
number of saplings that come up out of seeds every year across the entire
planet and calculated how feasible it would be to track every single and then
have us pay for it well of course that's the great part is you work to put all
the extra tech in the iPhone or the robot attached the side of your house
called a smart meter that's breaking into everything tracking you and then
admitting it's doing it well and let's talk about payment here because I want
to tie this back to San Antonio where I was just down yesterday we met for a
couple of hours with the vendor that's producing these radio tracking beacons
around kids next and he was boasting well we use this down in the spring
independent school district down in you know Houston and and and we saved them a
million dollars that's like saying well there was slavery before I mean there's
lots of slaves in Angola well we're going back to slavery well this idea
that they saved a million dollars in in missed attendance over the last four
years and then he turns around in the almost the same breath he says and the
city of San Antonio this district is investing 13 million dollars in
surveillance cameras and I said hang on a second so you're tracking kids so you
can save a million dollars in lost attendance money and then you're turning
around and spending 13 million dollars on surveillance cameras so where is the
money coming from and what is the money being used for do we really need 13
million dollars worth of surveillance cameras in one tiny district in San
Antonio so all that justification this immense amount of money that gets spent
by the way those those those cameras our Department of Defense paid for our money
again that scans with a smart computer how much calories you eat off the Apple
and it's watching what the kids eat I mean this is beyond 1984 yeah and what
the vendor was telling us a company called Wade Garcia they put this program
together down there they were actually telling us that they've gotten inquiries
from schools they want to have GPS trackers on the kids and want to be able
to track them when they go home at night I actually want to track them off the
campus he was saying one of these administrators says I can't sleep at
night thinking that when the kids get off the bus they've got to walk home we
need to have GPS you've got to make it more affordable and they need to then
say the kid was out too long so CPS can come take your kids or yeah there's a
million things you can do once you track them home here's the toll-free number

to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I
was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the

we now take you live to the Central Texas command center in the heart of the
resistance
Steven is your nakas the retired top general is working with mayor Bloomberg
on how the military can be used to confiscate our guns you know I I thought
hey I haven't hit refresh on info wars calm in about 45 minutes talking to dr.
Catherine Albrecht here in studio with us in Austin Texas I better hit refresh
and during the break I hit refresh and during the break I watch some of the
video we're downloading right now we'll have after we take some calls this is
kind of a you know emergency they've got counties all over going we'll just take
guns during any storm or problem just like Katrina and and now retired general
tells Biden military can help with gun control agenda Feinstein again promises
to press the case for disarming the American people we have the memo from
the Justice Department saying ban all the guns and turn them in and the
communist Chinese I've got to mention this yesterday Michael Savage was on
because his premise is that's me uses the muscle they said the people's daily
twice wage a war against your gun owners that's a quote we're ready to help and
by the way we own your debt so step and fetch so there you go ladies and
gentlemen in fact punch this up for folks retired general tells by military
can help with gun control agenda yep the big red one could come to your town and
kill your mommy and your daddy because you know the extremists aren't al-qaeda
now it's the gun owning conservative libertarian look at Feinstein I made
over 100 million bucks when I went to the Senate off 175,000 a year yeah if
you believe that I got a bridge I'll sell you so amazing amazing that that
story's been out I haven't even covered that that is just incredible we'll get
back to more of that here in just a moment New York 7 round law bans most
firearms eyewitness yes to the Nazis did confiscate guns the media is denying
that that says Hitler was pro-gun even though it's on record he wasn't it's
just incredible lies just like did you see where Robert Gibbs Catherine was was
was told now the drum program is public and admitted all the world killing
people but you're to say it doesn't exist and he said yeah but that didn't
make sense but it was the Karl Rove an idea of just say there is no RFID there
is no cancer increase there there is no new world order well wait you just
announced it and I had the Nightline host the ABC Nightly News host go
that's a different world government I mean it's like they've gotten to the
point where it's a learned what do you call that psychologically yeah you know
I'm not really sure but if you if you give people who don't want to know if
you give them somebody to point to and say see they said it's not true then you
let people kind of hide and I think that's really what it's about they know
if you're paying attention you know they're absolutely lying but then you go
and you talk to your mother-in-law or you talk to you know your your your
brother-in-law and they say you're full of it look this expert just finished
saying it's not they don't respect you they respect the expert they don't know
yeah which is which is I think the purpose of that outright propaganda that
you can see through like a transparent you know she the saran wrap the reason
for it is that there are people who will cling to it no matter how ridiculous it
is because they're in denial because they're scared yeah and they want they
want like no no the world is round they're like nope
Robert Gibbs said in this document it is flat and that there's candy rock
mountains at the end of that's right that's right so that's why it works if
you ever wonder why would they say something so obviously false like do
they think we're stupid and the reality is they it's not that they think we're
stupid is that they know that there are people who will cling to that and use it
to tell you to shut up well and it's also an acclimate or where you just get
used to them just just pushing but bizarre baloney yeah it is too right and
you get to the point where we're really we're becoming overwhelmed I think with
so many different voices when I first interviewed you and we're gonna calls in
2001 when you were first you know you were even just you were in Harvard at
the time or whatever you were fighting the loyalty cards and you got into RFID
and you said they're using it to track and do all this they'll use it for your
health insurance under socialist health care and now let me punch it up for
viewers out there voila how the insurer knows you just stocked up on ice cream
and beer the exact examples I use years ago was ice cream and beer to now
increase your insurance because they say that's bad for you even though most
studies show a couple beers actually relaxes you you can argue it gets
extreme and gets abused sure or who's to say you can't go run five miles and have
some ice cream this is the nanny state and now Bloomberg says what you'll eat
Michelle Obama says you'll eat I mean these people are incredible I gotta say
back in 1999 when I founded Caspian and we put up the no cards org website which
is ancient now and hasn't been updated but it's historically still there no
cards org back when I put that that website together the the concern was
that we are registering our purchases so whenever you scan a supermarket card you
are registering your food and the reason that we all resist the registration of
guns is because we understand first they register then they regulate then they
restrict then they confiscate and the same is true for food first they
register which is what the supermarket cards are then they will begin to
restrict and regulate and then they will begin to confiscate so look at this it
even says that the employers get into the files and get to know what you're
eating now oh the fun is everyone gets to be a Stasi spy yeah I mean holy crap
I'm sorry go ahead yeah so the idea here is that you will be told when you get to
the supermarket there are people talking about this that when you put that that
pound of butter in there and you scan your frequent shopper card which will at
some point I believe become mandatory they'll say no I'm sorry you've already
had your monthly quota of butter you can't have that butter you're gonna have
to put that back and get and by the way the top environmental groups say oh with
all this now we will ration what you eat absolutely that's in the planned
Opelis videos for kids where you get meat on your birthday absolutely my the
smart grid is the death grid is the slave grid and does anyone listening out
there really want to be part of this yeah so this whole idea of sharing this
information with with health insurers you know I first revealed this in 2004
where I found out that stop and shop our biggest chain in New England was
actually sharing shopper card information with health insurance
they're selling it that well they were they in in that case they said well it
because I asked them I was in a meeting and I asked the VP of Technology why are
you doing this why are you collecting all this information why are you
converting it into nutritional health records they now have programs where
everything they scan they instantly add all the calories all the you know every
ingredient it all gets tallied up for your individual profile and I said why
are you doing that he said well we hope to recoup some of the money we've spent
by sharing that information with HMOs and they can use it to raise your rates
cancel your policy and once we get into Obamacare this is where this gets really
frightening once we hit Obamacare and I'm paying for your health insurance and
that guy over there is health insurance and he's paying for mine then it's going
to be an argument that oh they already do it they go because that guy's eating
the wrong food no no that's the collectivist model now it doesn't matter
that you pay for your own plan now Oh everyone gets to decide because we're
all together it's the equivalent of having everyone in the world living in
your house yeah no privacy no nothing every control freak over you a bunch of
nannies bossing each but then never any concern in what we're eating with the
HMOs they're not worried about aspartame GMO it's all about the calories or the
calories and you know there are people in that world who are sincere and really
do want to see people be useful idiots yeah but the the underlying issue is
going to be an issue of we have we have unthinkingly allowed the creation of a
food registration network it's global in Jamaica they have frequent shopper cards
in Czechoslovakia they have them in South Korea they have them everywhere
you go in the globe now there is software installed at the cash register
and they push you to get them everywhere they push them everywhere explain just
in a nutshell before we go to calls of the scam in them why they started them
yeah well they started them for two reasons one was to collect your data so
they know everything you bought so that they could follow your household and and
and make sure that you don't get coupons for the things you buy so you know I
remember back when my mom when I was a little girl my mom would clip coupons
for the stuff we bought we had a cat so she clipped nine lives coupons well what
the industry now says is we want to make sure that you never again get a coupon
for anything you buy because you're gonna buy it anyway why would we give
you a discount so they know you and then even the mailing list or they have
actuaries on everybody this is admitted it's all the way to screw you yeah so
especially in that marketing sense so now you get a coupon for friskies and
then they sit back and see if you actually cash it in if you actually used
it and then they can say well look we move 15% of people over to this other
brand so it's all a plan even the RFID fridge the Procter & Gamble had an
internal document that we found in spy chips Procter & Gamble said we want to
hook up your fridge your smart refrigerator to your television cable
network so when you remove the last can of coke your TV runs an ad for Pepsi
that was like ten years ago yes and let's see now that's what they admit
they're doing it's all actually occurring it is a master technocratic
prison planet takeover everything that they that we predicted in spy chips and
I would encourage people it's like it's like G Edward Griffin's book on the
Federal Reserve thank you everything that we wrote about in there in 2006 is
all happening today it's all coming and again to everybody in the system so many
there's different types there's not just those in denial or those that accept it
then there's bureaucrat types that go yeah I know it's happening you don't
like it do you they're like a little kid imagining they're Batman they're
imagining they're a winner and they're part of it when the system's attacking
them oh yeah I mean it's a system that once you dead idiots you're not part of
the winning team you either join humanity and wake up and get your butt
right with God or you join the devil because listen if even you don't believe
in the devil this might as well be the devil okay even if the devil isn't
physically or spiritually real the New World Order is the worst of the worst it
is the devil you understand it's kinda like Ray Kurzweil says I don't believe
in God yet he believes he's gonna become God and merge with the computer as the
head of Google's head of technology and you can laugh this guy's running your
life and mine too okay listen even if you don't believe in the devil the devil
believes in you and I'll take his thing and turn it back Ray Kurzweil doesn't
believe in God he believes in the devil and believes he will become the devil
they believe they're building God but they're really building the devil even
if you're an atheist can you get this in your head could humans build something
that that acted like the devil and took over and did horrible things a global
control grid that wants to kill you that's the devil kill steal and destroy
so they're building the devil they're building the devil the devil's real
folks they're building the devil I mean isn't that a revelation I think it is
and you know who got it Tolkien got it you know you think about the Lord of the
Ring of Power right they were building it so that Sauron could occupy it you
know many people throughout history have understood this that humanity will build
something and once that something is built then the evil consciousness will
then embody itself into it and then enslave human well that's how it's
always worked absolutely it is that the tell Sauron build me an army yeah you
know worthy of Mordor yeah so power of isengard is at your command you do that
well so yes it is it is definitely coming and you know to get back to the
Titanic analogy we've got to tell people to get in the lifeboat and as far as I'm
concerned that lifeboat the only thing that's going to save you is that saving
blood of Jesus Christ that's it because everything else I mean this thing wants
our blood it wants to eat us the Bible tells us it comes to destroy and devour
eat consume that's the reason why that's why the high priest the high priest it
says the magicians of Babylon you pull the quotes up trafficked in the souls
of men hey that's what they want is your soul they want to know what you're into
and they want to manipulate what you're into I mean they want your soul well
that gets me to Google knowing what you're into and manipulating it yeah so
you know one of the things I don't know if you're familiar with the filter
bubble yes but this idea that Google it decides what you want now but not really
that then it can distort that yes and it creates this notion you ever have the
feeling and I'm sure your listeners have this feeling that how could everybody
not know this that and the other you know you you look something up in your
first 10 search results tell you exactly this that you're they are
compartmentalizing just like Romans compartmentalized Rome into nine
different ethnic groups to control them we're being compartmentalized we
segregated we are and what it does is it those of us who are in the know of a
certain kind of information we find that every time we do a search on Google we
get more of that same information and that causes us to become more and more
incensed more and more angry and more and more in a way isolated because if
you go out and you look at what your brother-in-law gets when he searches for
the exact same thing on Google he'll get a whole set of links that have nothing
it's giving him the reality he wants yes so if we look up Monsanto based well I
don't use Google so it won't happen to me but if somebody who uses Google
regularly listens to your show and looks up this kind of stuff looks up on Santo
they'll get Monsanto lawsuit and GMO damage and dead hamsters and all of that
but if somebody else looks at Monsanto they'll get Monsanto stock values
Monsanto contributing to the betterment of Africa Monsanto working with Bill
Gates to do good things so it's a different reality that we're seeing and
so when we wonder why are they not waking up it's because when we tell them
things and they try to look them up they get different answers that's right
because it already profiled what was keeping them in the matrix and so they
want us to think we're out there winning putting us in our own matrix but then
it's worse than that and David I actually got shots of this we have a
bunch of YouTube channels all total it's like 600 million views in our channels
and fan channels but but one of them got up to 300 million and I saw a couple
months ago it hit right at 300 million and then I saw it like 390 now that I'm
busy whatever that 380 million and then 370 million and they're just taking our
views away and I went and looked it up and I already knew the reason they're
gaming at taking a Sony's views away and stuff to pay them yeah but but they're
doing it across the board with the algorithm even though we're not
monetized they don't get my little joke is that we don't take their ads but
doesn't matter we don't have gained views but they're
just they just took 30 million views and now it's more every day and and then
people that were already in our network they all still get the subscription but
I talked to new people that subscribe or people who just woke up they don't get
the subscription I mean this is I mean think of how this is war game it is I
said we go to calls but and well one last thing I do want to say is I'm not
sure how much longer we're gonna be able to rely on the internet in its present
form oh they're already they've said they're killing the old webpage and when
you're talking about getting the word out I did want to mention up in New
Hampshire where I live way up in the middle of nowhere I was driving on a
very lonely road and then I headed onto a freeway and I'm heading up in northern
New Hampshire and there goes two cars with infowars bumper stickers and then
two days later I was in Amherst New Hampshire very conservative very low-key
community and on the stop sign somebody put an info or sticker right across the
stop sign so you're getting the word out in ways that don't rely on on Google
reporting back or on YouTube reporting back but on actual people doing tangible
actual things and we need more of that well here's how I like in Google since
she's the Lord of the Rings that's why I talked about Sauron and Gandalf they
if you really read it he was a genius Tolkien because what they are is that
they're really angels in men's form but but Sauron's an evil he's an angel
decided to join Lucifer or Morgoth who is then Sauron but if you actually read
the lore of it's really interesting as the guy was a linguist and studied
ancient religions and stuff so that's what he was kind of inculcating a
Christian myth mythos into this larger thing he was a Christian but the issue
is he goes in and he says you know where'd you get this crystal ball that's
dangerous those see both ways and Gandalf touches it and sees Sauron
looking at him even though it had a cloth over like a TV now right it's your
TV it's seeing both ways so Google but see you're just seeing what you're
looking for Google's tying it into everything yeah and so you are literally
that is a spider eye and a compound eye of Lucifer you are literally in engaging
Lucifer that's a brilliant way of putting it no it is you're giving
Lucifer where you're going what you're doing everything you stand for you are
in a chamber with Lucifer looking right at you yeah so I guess you can think of
start page that it's a real crystal ball that's did you know before I looked it
up I knew they called it a crystal ball and this epiphany about seven years ago
and I looked it up and found white papers with Google scientist MIT saying
it will be a crystal ball where they can see the future in mass movements and it
turned out they have built crystal balls that's what this is is an interface to a
crystal ball but I'm only looking in from one position it is networked into
everything like you said I'm sorry I'm ranting we're gonna do overdrive how's
that sound I never let you get any rest then you got to the nightly news we're
gonna wear Catherine Albrecht out your calls coming up stay with us are you or

right here calls here White House blames big sis for alien release that's up at
drudge drudge report calm and they already released illegal aliens all the
time it just shows how the globalist want open borders to bring people in
politically to drive down wages and to then see themselves allied with the
government when the government just wants to bring the country down to
consolidate power dr. Catherine Alberts our guests people been patient holding
I'm gonna go to Keith and then we're gonna Mike Steve Julius and Mark probably
all the time we have real quick comment and question Keith in Indiana you're on
the air go ahead yes I thank you I used to live in Lancaster PA but four years
ago and they had the largest number of video cameras in the streets per
population and when people tried to protest against us the two things we
found out were that there were no Christians who attended the meetings and
they the lawyers told us that you can't have any right of public expectancy of
privacy in public
Catherine's audio headpiece isn't working for some reason but we'll we'll
try to get that hook yet is got unplugged when she got up and left we got
to watch that people get up and down we got we chose the same issue every time
people are live and we've got a headset with guests or something is this is like
Groundhog Day but that's basically the question I mean what is your overall
point on that front sir my point is that when I lived in a community that
actually had the cameras everywhere and you could walk from one end of town to
the other and you were being watched on a camera the conservative Christians
didn't have anything to do with protesting against that they just refuse
to do anything and the only thing is their churches are totally run by
government agents it's called clergy response teams
what's your test thank you for the call sir great point what's your take on the
mainline Christian Church just saying hey take chips cameras take four shots
everything's wonderful forced abortion it's all good because we're all going
to be teleported out of here with a rapture yeah you know that's funny
because when we were protesting I did a prayer vigil outside of the Alzheimer's
facility where they were chipping the Alzheimer's patients actually sticking
it into the arms of grandma they had 200 people that they were chipping and I
tried to find a local church in West Palm Beach Florida they would have
somebody come out and join me and lead the prayer and I called church I got the
phone book and I called church after church after church and they all said
either we think that's a great idea why would you oppose that they're of the
devil they said well you're showing a lack of faith by even objecting to that
don't you know we're all gonna be raptured away so I the Bible is very
ambiguous they're gonna accept the devil's or isn't there is or isn't a
rapture it doesn't you're to fight evil I gotta say that if if the folks who
believe in a rapture are wrong that here's what's gonna happen when it
actually does come time to either put your head in the guillotine and be
beheaded or take the mark of the beast you know that the devil's gonna be saying
all the Christians who believed in oh this is Jesus they're gonna say no
they're actually gonna say your God isn't real he didn't save you that
that's all a fairy tale how these people it's so demonic these churches well
jamming a call of Julius no no first up was Mike in Tennessee 1600 a.m. wmg wmqm
I believe is the call letters I'll go ahead Mike good afternoon dr. Jones and
dr. Albright February 4th was a deadline for completing your United States 2012
census of agriculture which required you to list everything that you have on any
piece of foreign property animals and everything and yesterday was the
deadline I don't feel any of it out it's all fraudulent and they lie and say us
code you have to do it us code you just got to see how many people live there
it's all a fraud but yeah the census is part of this this is the agriculture
census yesterday was the deadline for the federal animal disease traceability
rule it took effect yesterday requiring tattooing tagging and otherwise marking
of everyone stay there I'm gonna come back to you a little bit overdrive but
let me just explain something everybody okay we have a ranch we have a farm the
animal ID the premises ID it's all color of law they tell you it's a lot of
action your kids there is no law in any state in the Union there's a waiver you
get for but if it's not even a waiver to a law it's a regulation it's a hoax and
and yes I'm aware of all that will come right back to you but this is part of
the takeover of the food supply stay with us
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
Alex Jones
Catherine Alberts also gonna be on the nightly news tonight I think Melissa
Melton's hosting it I meant to get to all your calls I just it's so much
important information Mike in Tennessee listening on 1600 a.m. we got a lot of
affiliates in Tennessee that's a great affiliate right there but Mike go ahead
and make your point sir I'm just looking at the incrementalism then as Catherine
was talking earlier about how they enact their stuff and then they immediately
come out with the the follow-up and yeah everybody needs to wake up I mean there
was on the news the other night they were showing car crashes in Germany
where in Germany every car has a dashboard cam so they can in real time
see what's going on from the dashboard of your cars they no longer need
cameras over the interstates every car is a oh yeah I saw Toyota like six
years ago say in the future a camera will watch you and call the police if
your kid isn't in a seat belt and the computer is smart and knows if they are
I mean it's like 1984 times 10 and it's like oh what's the big deal I mean it's
crazy just like I told people 15 years ago on star listens to you later it came
out well I had an FBI source on that they did and you know in San Antonio we
saw a vision of the future yesterday when we visited the vendor of this RFID
tracking program because they pulled up a screen for us and on the screen you
could see the circles of the school and then they could click on a circle and
tell you how many people were in it and then they could click and show you their
picture their school ID number their grade their name all their personal
information came up and as we were driving stopped at a traffic light I
said in the future there's going to be a circle and the police are going to be
able to pull up a circle of the entire city and click the that intersection and
know everybody who's there and the only thing missing to make that possible is
for all of us to carry the device that links into the global brain and then
it's done so I actually saw the future yesterday was and again they say what's
wrong with that it's convenient the global brains run by the devil yeah well
there you go I mean it's like it's like hey it's just a babysitter it's a
cannibal you know it's like what's wrong with a babysitter it's a kid I got next
door neighbors a cannibal he's a convicted cannibal so not a good got out
of jail for 40 years it's like if the guy running the machine it's not nice
not a good babysitter exactly and and that's the whole thing if we could
actually trust government and we could trust our fellow human being to be
perfect stuff would be great it'd be great you'd go sure that sounds like a
perfect idea but the reality we have that's like hey let's keep mentally
ill people from having guns the problem is you're on record when all our guns
yeah stop stop trying to sound reasonable well and how long before they
say we're mentally ill because we are already doing that let's jam another one
