[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.760 --> 00:37.200]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:37.200 --> 00:44.040]  Well, the House Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte is calling for Eric Holder to resign. We're
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.880]  gonna be getting to that today. A lot happening. The London Guardian asked, will journalists
[00:49.880 --> 00:54.920]  take any steps to defend against attacks on press freedom or are they so bought and paid
[00:54.920 --> 00:55.920]  for?
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.560]  They're going to go quietly into the night on that. The Tea Party's fighting back with
[00:59.560 --> 01:06.880]  a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve's collection agency, the IRS. House investigators are
[01:06.880 --> 01:13.000]  subpoenaing all communications on Benghazi talking points. We've got some clips that
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.920]  were dug up separately from Benghazi on IRSgate, where as I had remembered a year ago, they
[01:18.920 --> 01:26.880]  had hearings with the director of the IRS denying that anyone was targeting Tea Party
[01:26.880 --> 01:28.160]  or conservative or Christian groups.
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.560]  I mean, this has been well known. And that was brought up cuz MSNBC was bragging about
[01:32.560 --> 01:37.160]  it. So they've now found those clips and it's in a Mitch McConnell Republican TV ad we're
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.600]  gonna be playing. I saw it yesterday, meant to get to it. We're gonna air it coming up
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.200]  today. Bill O'Reilly, I mean, not only do we have Rachel Maddow coming out and lying
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.800]  and saying that I said that the tornado that killed a bunch of poor people, good souls
[01:52.800 --> 01:56.040]  up in Oklahoma, outside Oklahoma City and more.
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.360]  She said that I said Obama sent the tornado. When a caller asked about it and all I said
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.560]  was, the caller's like, I think it's weather warfare. Somebody in Moore said that. And
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.880]  I said, well, they have that, but it's mainly general fronts they can weather modify. You're
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.960]  in tornado alley, this is probably real.
[02:15.960 --> 02:20.120]  That then turns into, of course, we have the full clip and articles wrote about it, that
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.920]  I said he sent a tornado. Well, now Bill O'Reilly agrees that we should shut down people's free
[02:24.920 --> 02:32.340]  speech and that there needs to be mainstream media needs to be protected and have rights.
[02:32.340 --> 02:38.680]  But that the alternative media blogs, news sites, anything that isn't CNN or Fox News
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.720]  or MSNBC, that it needs to be shut down and that Facebook's doing a good job shutting
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.240]  down hate speech like mothers that post photos of their autistic children at the March on
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.040]  Monsanto. We have one of those ladies, by the way, in studio today.
[02:56.040 --> 02:59.800]  She's already out there, amazing individual who was actually able to reverse her child's
[02:59.800 --> 03:07.040]  autism with some of the detoxing things that are out there. Andrea Llamas is gonna be in
[03:07.040 --> 03:13.800]  studio with a censored by Facebook on record for her evil hate speech of marching on Monsanto
[03:13.800 --> 03:16.480]  with her cute little children.
[03:16.480 --> 03:20.120]  That is hate and Bill O'Reilly says that's good. Then we can punch this article up for
[03:20.120 --> 03:26.080]  TV viewers, if not go to mfallwars.com. Bill O'Reilly smears Alex Jones in hate speech
[03:26.080 --> 03:34.240]  rant and he just says it's time to stop hate speech and flashes up out of context about
[03:34.240 --> 03:40.720]  a seven second rant I was making and then turns my face red.
[03:40.720 --> 03:47.260]  So here we are supporting the Justice Department not being able to go after News Corp and persecute
[03:47.260 --> 03:54.240]  them with blackmail over the phone hacking scandal in England. Because it's selective
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.040]  enforcement and meant to take down the whole press. Here I am supporting Rush Limbaugh
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.680]  not being kicked off the air last year with that whole thing of saying a woman wants us
[04:02.680 --> 04:09.080]  to pay for her condoms and birth control.
[04:09.080 --> 04:12.520]  Here I am not even agreeing with what he said totally but saying he shouldn't be taking
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.600]  off air. And here I am supporting everybody's free speech and then they're trying to get
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.040]  us shut down. That's how pathetic these people are.
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.800]  Bill O'Reilly knows about the Kennedy assassination. He had TV reports about it 20 years ago. I
[04:27.800 --> 04:36.360]  know people that know him. He was a anti-noodle order guy 20 years ago, 15 years ago. I remember
[04:36.360 --> 04:39.600]  seeing him on Fox News like 15 years ago talking about the Illuminati. But when he did that
[04:39.600 --> 04:45.780]  whole sexual harassment thing and settled it and would send security after people that
[04:45.780 --> 04:51.320]  called his show, that disagreed with him and threatened people. I mean he is a authoritarian
[04:51.320 --> 05:00.200]  dirt bag joke who hates freedom and who hates free speech. We'll be right back.

[05:54.600 --> 06:03.320]  or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog. A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research
[06:03.320 --> 06:07.880]  into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving and my research
[06:07.880 --> 06:12.680]  led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[06:12.680 --> 06:17.560]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[06:17.560 --> 06:23.280]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[06:23.280 --> 06:29.040]  fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out

[06:33.880 --> 06:39.360]  real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[07:06.120 --> 07:10.680]  flu recently discovered in China there has never been a more crucial time to support

[08:02.240 --> 08:26.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:26.320 --> 08:34.320]  What you've got is all that I need. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining
[08:34.320 --> 08:46.280]  us here today. It is Thursday, Fours Day, the 30th day of May 2013. We are going to
[08:46.280 --> 08:53.040]  be here live for the next three hours. Ashley Jessica will be joining us at the bottom of
[08:53.040 --> 08:59.100]  this hour in about 25 minutes. She is an Infowars auxiliary reporter, always does a great job,
[08:59.100 --> 09:06.140]  and she videotaped her girlfriend and herself being groped by the TSA.
[09:06.140 --> 09:11.400]  And it's been CBS News, you name it everywhere, but not giving Infowars credit for breaking
[09:11.400 --> 09:16.640]  the video, which is fine, doesn't matter. We are still more and more setting the agenda
[09:16.640 --> 09:22.340]  of liberty, exposing the tyranny. So don't give us credit, whatever. And it's been in
[09:22.340 --> 09:26.700]  no exaggeration, I don't know, like 15 major newspapers, but she was interviewed by CNN.
[09:26.700 --> 09:32.040]  She was interviewed by a bunch of other TV networks, and then her interviews never aired.
[09:32.040 --> 09:36.480]  They covered the event, but then did interviews, and then never aired her because they couldn't
[09:36.480 --> 09:42.840]  edit what she said out of context. That's why they never aired my taped interviews,
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.560]  because I just say it in little info packets. I'm much better when I'm on an enemy program
[09:47.560 --> 09:51.500]  because I know I have limited time and it has a way of focusing me.
[09:51.500 --> 09:54.540]  And then they can't really edit anything out of context, so it makes them angry. That's
[09:54.540 --> 09:59.520]  why they come to the radio show like Rachel Maddow and MSNBC, and I could probably sue
[09:59.520 --> 10:02.440]  them. I could probably get a judgment, even though I'm a public figure, but I don't wanna
[10:02.440 --> 10:03.440]  do that.
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.980]  They already hurt themselves, worse than they hurt me. If they ever succeed in hurting me,
[10:07.980 --> 10:12.500]  I'll probably sue some people, cuz that's when the lawsuit's a sure thing. Saying that
[10:12.500 --> 10:20.580]  I said Obama sent a tornado to hit Oklahoma City, when a caller said, I think it's weather
[10:20.580 --> 10:21.580]  weapons.
[10:21.580 --> 10:24.360]  And I said, well, there are weather weapons, that's real, but I don't think this is a weather
[10:24.360 --> 10:30.240]  weapon. That turned into, I said Obama did it, which is a pure attempt to not listen
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.080]  to Alex Jones, to not have Alex Jones on the radio, to not have people come on my show.
[10:35.080 --> 10:41.840]  And now Bill O'Reilly has come out and said it's time to shut down hate speech in America
[10:41.840 --> 10:45.560]  and then played a clip of me completely out of context.
[10:45.560 --> 10:51.600]  This is a guy who put caller ID on his radio show that was unpopular and failed. And if
[10:51.600 --> 10:57.720]  someone disagreed with him, he's such a bully punk. I'd like to get in a boxing ring with
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.520]  Bill O'Reilly. Bill O'Reilly, I challenge you to a pay-per-view boxing match. You think
[11:02.520 --> 11:03.520]  you're so tough.
[11:03.520 --> 11:08.280]  Now, your dad was a tough Irish cop, beats you up, you say? Well, come on, you're a lot
[11:08.280 --> 11:11.680]  bigger than me? Let's get in the ring, buddy. In fact, you can bring one of your buddies.
[11:11.680 --> 11:15.520]  Because I can only wake up when there's two people to fight. You and whoever you want,
[11:15.520 --> 11:19.960]  in the ring, let's go punk. All right, you think you're so tough, you try to intimidate
[11:19.960 --> 11:20.960]  your guests.
[11:20.960 --> 11:23.880]  You get in their face, you turn their mic off, you get in their face and poke your finger
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.260]  in their face, you big fat bully. You sit there whenever, you're scared to have me on
[11:29.260 --> 11:33.440]  your show. Of course, you get like 10 million viewers. You normally have about 2 million.
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.440]  Let's pull up his latest ratings, they've dropped a lot. I mean, sure, you're coming
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.600]  down fast, but you're miles above MSNBC and CNN. But still, I mean, you're jealous. Your
[11:42.600 --> 11:45.640]  radio show failed.
[11:45.640 --> 11:49.540]  You're a failure, and I'm gonna get to this. The reason he makes me so mad, and you know
[11:49.540 --> 11:54.520]  I don't attack other people in media until they attack me and lie about me. And he gets
[11:54.520 --> 12:00.240]  up there and agrees we should shut down hate speech, which is anybody criticizing the corrupt
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.680]  media and government.
[12:01.680 --> 12:05.520]  And all these old fake neocons, all these fake conservatives, all these fake liberals,
[12:05.520 --> 12:10.400]  all these socialists, all these authoritarians. They're all the dying dinosaur media in a
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.940]  perfect storm with the rotting government. Their ratings are all dropping, our ratings
[12:15.940 --> 12:18.520]  are going up, and they know that and they're upset.
[12:18.520 --> 12:26.240]  And so they're circling the wagons, like you know what circling the toilet bowl. Like Karl
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.780]  Rove, turd blossom circling the toilet bowl. I mean, you got Karl Rove attacking the alternative
[12:31.780 --> 12:39.080]  media, and the Tea Party, and Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz. Because we're the future, you're
[12:39.080 --> 12:46.000]  the past. You've got the entire hit parade of neocons attacking Matt Drudge and DrudgeReport.com.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.440]  Because Matt Drudge was the past, the present, and the future, because he likes liberty.
[12:51.440 --> 12:57.880]  He likes the truth. He likes the racy reality of standing up to tyranny.
[12:57.880 --> 13:03.480]  He's the future. He's independent. You're the past. I'm independent. I'm the future.
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.960]  You're the past, the wave of the future. And you know we're the wave of the future. And
[13:09.960 --> 13:16.140]  you don't like the wave of the future. You know you're stating a joke. I mean, somebody
[13:16.140 --> 13:20.720]  calls in and attacks me and says, I disagree with you.
[13:20.720 --> 13:26.120]  I don't run and try to hook up caller ID and then have private security go to the person's
[13:26.120 --> 13:32.120]  house. I don't sit here and get female employees at my office and call them up every night
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.920]  going, I'll give you a raise if you come over here and have sex with me. That's what Bill
[13:37.920 --> 13:43.720]  O'Reilly settled on out of court. I mean, he's a bully perv. You wanna start a fight
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.720]  with me, punk?
[13:44.720 --> 13:51.760]  You punk, you think you can shove me around? You're a coward, and that's why you'll take
[13:51.760 --> 13:57.840]  me out of context and call for Facebook to censor myself and others. You wanna use me
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.960]  as the poster boy of your censorship, of your attempt to extinguish the fire of liberty?
[14:03.960 --> 14:10.040]  Thank you for throwing me in that briar patch, pal. You're a coward, punk, rat bastard.
[14:10.040 --> 14:16.080]  Excuse me, I got a lot of news to cover, but I'm gonna get to that later. I've had enough
[14:16.080 --> 14:26.120]  of it. I've had enough of these cowards up there like both of these guys, Rachel Maddow
[14:26.120 --> 14:27.120]  and him.
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.480]  I'm sick of them. I'm tired of them. They don't have the will to actually debate me.
[14:33.480 --> 14:39.080]  Come on my show, punk. You're all, he's countless times he's been sent to the clips. He goes,
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.200]  we don't know who this guy is that was on The View. We don't know who this guy is doing
[14:42.200 --> 14:48.080]  this. Nobody knows who he is. Because they don't even say who I am when they put me up
[14:48.080 --> 14:50.160]  on TV and say, here's hate speech.
[14:50.160 --> 15:01.920]  I'm just hate speech. You know what my name is? My name is hate speech. O'Reilly has three
[15:01.920 --> 15:07.080]  million viewers, and that's been dropping. The point is, they just put the numbers up
[15:07.080 --> 15:16.400]  on screen, the latest Nielsen's. This guy thinks if he ignores us, that that's how he
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.400]  suppresses the Liberty movement.
[15:19.400 --> 15:24.520]  And then if he just occasionally plays clips out of context, he'll inoculate his audience
[15:24.520 --> 15:30.000]  into disliking us. When all you did was send your moderately sized audience over to Us
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.160]  Bill. And by the way, some of the liberal sites posted it. And most of the conservatives
[15:35.160 --> 15:41.320]  and the liberals and libertarians, when I was reading the comments, unified and defended
[15:41.320 --> 15:42.900]  me.
[15:42.900 --> 15:53.700]  Only you, only you could unify people. Only you, Bill O'Reilly. So thanks a lot. You actually
[15:53.700 --> 16:01.920]  do have somewhat of an audience from posing as a conservative. And so thank you for sending
[16:01.920 --> 16:07.220]  us your audience, just reminding them we're here. So they come over to mfallwars.com and
[16:07.220 --> 16:14.040]  prisonplanet.com. And I know it hurts you to do it. You've got Glenn Beck saying I'm
[16:14.040 --> 16:20.920]  a spooky fascist and a liar with no evidence.
[16:20.920 --> 16:24.600]  You've got Bill O'Reilly saying I'm hate speech and need to be shut down. You've got Rachel
[16:24.600 --> 16:31.280]  Maddow saying it's time to not give him attention. It's time to not listen to him. Please, Republicans,
[16:31.280 --> 16:38.680]  stop giving him power. What are you doing? Because I care about you, Republicans. Just
[16:38.680 --> 16:42.840]  whatever you do, don't talk about him. Don't listen to him. Listen, he's the kook saying
[16:42.840 --> 16:44.280]  the government can't be trusted.
[16:44.280 --> 16:47.520]  He's the kook saying there's tyranny. He's the kook saying they're buying billions of
[16:47.520 --> 16:52.980]  bullets and armored vehicles and preparing an illegal war. And if the people listen,
[16:52.980 --> 16:57.220]  we won't be able to have our takeover plan and stage a false flag and take over. This
[16:57.220 --> 17:03.400]  guy's kryptonite to us. This guy's like high noon to Cal Dracula. Whatever you do, please
[17:03.400 --> 17:13.920]  bury him somehow. Stop him. Don't look at him. This is horrible, oh my gosh.
[17:13.920 --> 17:25.740]  She had a big graphic up there with my face saying twisted. I'm twisted. Maybe I am twisted.
[17:25.740 --> 17:32.840]  That's why I can see all your crap. If I'm twisted, thank the maker that I'm twisted.
[17:32.840 --> 17:41.520]  Thank Jehovah I'm twisted. Thank Yeshua I'm twisted. Thank Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior,
[17:41.520 --> 17:42.520]  that I'm twisted.
[17:42.520 --> 17:52.640]  If I'm twisted, Lord, give me more twisting. Twist me up. I got a bunch of clubs coming
[17:52.640 --> 18:04.280]  up. It's just that the reason you have the entire parade of narcissistic shell out, cozied
[18:04.280 --> 18:11.160]  up to different arms of the establishment, different heads of the Hydra. They're to co-op
[18:11.160 --> 18:15.260]  the liberty movement and these people realize they're losing control of the narrative.
[18:15.260 --> 18:18.960]  That's why they're all panicking. They're sick of hearing about Infowars.com. They're
[18:18.960 --> 18:24.280]  sick of hearing about DrudgeReport.com. Glenn Beck's smart. He's gone to become the leader
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.920]  libertarians and what I was like 10 years ago on the radio. I mean, he at least gets
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.160]  where the market's at. I'll take a mercenary like that any day. He's better than his old
[18:34.160 --> 18:38.220]  buddy O'Reilly. These two were supposedly best buddies. I've seen Beck back on O'Reilly
[18:38.220 --> 18:42.260]  a few months ago when O'Reilly was being mean to him and Beck was turning red and laughing
[18:42.260 --> 18:43.260]  back at him.
[18:43.260 --> 18:47.200]  I mean, these guys aren't even nice to each other. How could you travel all over the country
[18:47.200 --> 18:51.160]  with somebody, say you're great buddies with them, and then sit there and snipe at each
[18:51.160 --> 18:57.080]  other because Fox and News Corp ordered them to against Glenn Beck. They have no honor.
[18:57.080 --> 19:02.260]  There is no honor among thieves, as it's said. And they're trying to steal your mind. They're
[19:02.260 --> 19:08.180]  trying to steal a real restoration, a revolution against tyranny. They wanna shut it off down
[19:08.180 --> 19:09.240]  a black hole.
[19:09.240 --> 19:18.680]  They don't like the fact that info wars, they hate that,.com is setting the agenda more
[19:18.680 --> 19:24.760]  and more. Not setting a baloney division agenda, a distraction agenda, a divide and conquer
[19:24.760 --> 19:31.520]  agenda. They're mad because we are unifying liberty lovers of every race, color, creed,
[19:31.520 --> 19:40.640]  ethnicity, sexual persuasion, whatever around freedom. That's why they don't like us. That's
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.460]  why they're attacking. And we're giving people hope that we can beat the globalist and we
[19:45.460 --> 19:50.460]  can create justice and then we can have a future together. And that's why they're scared
[19:50.460 --> 19:56.580]  because we carry the light of liberty in our hearts and souls. We come to defeat the New
[19:56.580 --> 20:02.120]  World Order and all the enemies are showing themselves.
[20:02.120 --> 20:08.780]  Time and time again. You need to come here and help us. We need assistance, please. Those
[20:08.780 --> 20:14.520]  we should be able to depend on, let us down. Federal and state and local officials saying
[20:14.520 --> 20:19.720]  help is on the way. Well, the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me. Don't depend on the
[20:19.720 --> 20:24.920]  government to save you. Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster

[21:02.640 --> 21:08.320]  up loads of ammo. At the same time, the restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms.
[21:08.320 --> 21:12.880]  Can you put two and two together? Infidel body armor can stop every round, including
[21:12.880 --> 21:19.040]  hollow points in 308 sniper rounds is reasonably priced and fully legal. But for how long?

[21:33.440 --> 21:37.600]  protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having a lead back at interest,
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.760]  forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[21:41.760 --> 21:45.160]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[21:45.160 --> 21:48.960]  a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains

[22:58.160 --> 22:59.160]  life's getting better.
[22:59.160 --> 23:04.540]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[23:04.540 --> 23:10.880]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.840]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living alone,
[23:15.840 --> 23:21.080]  it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing
[23:21.080 --> 23:25.560]  motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away
[23:25.560 --> 23:31.320]  from home. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer. And they're
[23:31.320 --> 23:36.200]  so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're so affordable
[23:36.200 --> 23:38.600]  that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[23:38.600 --> 23:47.000]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV
[23:47.000 --> 24:01.920]  or go to FAKETV.com. That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[24:01.920 --> 24:10.520]  Again, Bill O'Reilly, you coward, you bully. I know you're an old man, so you and whoever
[24:10.520 --> 24:17.760]  you want, bare knuckles boxing match. Pay-per-view to the charity of our choice is 50-50 split.
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.160]  You're such a big tough guy. Maybe you'll send a security force down here to try to
[24:22.160 --> 24:34.680]  intimidate me. Hate speech, punk. Till they got a hold of me. I used to help little old
[24:34.680 --> 24:46.040]  ladies across the street. I used to help the blind to see. Oh yeah. Cause I read the papers.
[24:46.040 --> 25:03.400]  They won't be seen with me. Feeling me. No more. No more. Hey, look at this. Government
[25:03.400 --> 25:08.840]  orders midwives to spy on racist parents. You've heard over in England and Europe, they're
[25:08.840 --> 25:13.200]  saying everyone will have a social worker assigned. Everyone that's in your life spying
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.800]  on you. And if you don't want totally open borders, and don't say that because racism's
[25:17.800 --> 25:23.900]  only by white people, that white people are inherently bad, then you will have your kids
[25:23.900 --> 25:24.900]  taken from you.
[25:24.900 --> 25:29.280]  That's a new BreakingInfoWars.com story by Paul Joseph Watson. That's coming up. Let
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.600]  me get to this right now because this is Breaking News. Max Scott, the interview, how should
[25:34.600 --> 25:40.640]  you Sherry chairman the Newsmax holder should resign. Here's that clip. Many Republicans
[25:40.640 --> 25:46.680]  have called for Eric Holder's resignation. Should he resign? Well, I'll add here in the
[25:46.680 --> 25:53.000]  last Congress, I co-sponsored a resolution calling for him to step down and he has still
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.160]  not complied with the subpoena that was given to him with regard to the investigation of
[26:01.160 --> 26:09.040]  Fast and Furious. And the result of that is that his non-compliance, his having been held
[26:09.040 --> 26:16.720]  in contempt of the House of Representatives, all indicates to me his unwillingness to take
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.040]  responsibility for the actions in the Justice Department, his inability to provide leadership
[26:22.040 --> 26:23.040]  and therefore-
[26:23.040 --> 26:27.260]  Oh no, he's providing leadership. All right, that's enough. All right, that's hate speech.
[26:27.260 --> 26:31.320]  We should let him run Fast and Furious. We should let him fund Al-Qaeda. We should let
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.080]  him do all this stuff. I mean, leave the president alone. That's hate speech. That's what the
[26:36.080 --> 26:40.200]  Soviet Union developed hate speech where you're shut down and then basically once you're silenced
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.160]  arrested for criticizing the government or any other corrupt group. And Bill O'Reilly
[26:44.160 --> 26:47.660]  thinks that's a great idea. I think that is very offensive. So there goes some hate speech
[26:47.660 --> 26:48.660]  right there.
[26:48.660 --> 26:55.480]  Now let's go to this Nixon and Obama. This article is Nix Obama up on Infowars.com. Here
[26:55.480 --> 27:01.680]  are the comparisons of Obama and Nixon. Now let's go ahead and play that.
[27:01.680 --> 27:07.040]  I have to tell you that is exactly the approach that the Nixon administration took.
[27:07.040 --> 27:08.040]  Interesting.
[27:08.040 --> 27:13.480]  I first learned from news reports.
[27:13.480 --> 27:17.840]  I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about
[27:17.840 --> 27:18.840]  this.
[27:18.840 --> 27:25.200]  The comments I made during this period, the comments made by my press secretary in my
[27:25.200 --> 27:34.240]  behalf were based on the information provided to us at the time we made those comments.
[27:34.240 --> 27:39.540]  Keep in mind, by the way, these so-called talking points that were prepared pretty much
[27:39.540 --> 27:44.080]  matched the assessments that I was receiving at that time.
[27:44.080 --> 27:50.000]  And had we not had that kind of security and that kind of secrecy that allowed for the
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.720]  kind of exchange that is essential.
[27:53.720 --> 28:01.440]  Leaks related to national security can put people at risk.
[28:01.440 --> 28:09.320]  I must now turn my full intention, and I shall do so once again, to the larger duties of
[28:09.320 --> 28:13.000]  this office.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.520]  Others may get distracted by chasing every fleeting issue that passes by, but the middle
[28:18.520 --> 28:20.600]  class will always be my number one focus.
[28:20.600 --> 28:24.760]  Yeah, when you're trying to destroy them. There is one last line that President Obama
[28:24.760 --> 28:27.160]  hasn't used yet, and that's...
[28:27.160 --> 28:35.160]  In any organization, the man at the top must bear the responsibility. That responsibility
[28:35.160 --> 28:42.280]  therefore belongs here in this office. I accept it.
[28:42.280 --> 28:46.880]  I am not a crook, yeah.
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.080]  That's revealing politics doing a great job. All right, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.860]  And that's why the system fears the alternative media, cuz we'll just show you how both parties
[28:54.860 --> 28:56.860]  are corrupt, out of control.
[28:56.860 --> 29:00.060]  And we're just looking for a few good men and women who care about their children's
[29:00.060 --> 29:06.400]  future in government, in corporations, in life to lead the way out of this corrupt morass
[29:06.400 --> 29:07.400]  that we've entered.
[29:07.400 --> 29:12.760]  Now, when we come back, we've got one more clip. This is demand answers put out by Mitch
[29:12.760 --> 29:21.760]  McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate. And then I am the Senate. Obama
[29:21.760 --> 29:29.100]  would have us believe, but he is not all powerful. And Obama is the nastiest expression of globalist
[29:29.100 --> 29:33.480]  terror I've ever seen because of the season we're in. But even though he's a power puppet,
[29:33.480 --> 29:37.680]  he must be politically destroyed.
[29:37.680 --> 29:45.400]  He must be politically annihilated to punish all these other crooks so that they fear the
[29:45.400 --> 29:49.840]  people and they fear justice.
[29:49.840 --> 29:56.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[34:09.440 --> 34:14.680]  Herr Schmitt there in the Bilderberg meeting with the silver platter. If you are a radio

[34:45.400 --> 34:49.840]  See as everyone begins to hate the establishment and really figure out, they are crooks, they
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.680]  are authoritarian. I am going to blow the whistle. You are going to have whistle blowing
[34:53.680 --> 34:59.440]  intensify worldwide. As people get the fact that hey, the government really is evil. These
[34:59.440 --> 35:04.520]  corporations are monopoly groups. They are teamed up with governments to destroy my future
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.600]  and they have been trying to intimidate all these liberty lovers and persecuting them.
[35:08.600 --> 35:14.080]  I am going to join them in the fight and the intimidation will then actually backfire.
[35:14.080 --> 35:19.120]  So that is coming up. But here is Mitch McConnell, who again I do not fantasize that Mitch McConnell
[35:19.120 --> 35:25.440]  is going to save us. Hell, Mitch McConnell tried to beat Rand Paul with Republican money
[35:25.440 --> 35:30.640]  and favored the banker funded candidate in the Kentucky primary a few years ago. But
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.140]  Rand beat him despite the Republican machine.
[35:35.140 --> 35:41.320]  And Rand basically talked to him behind the scenes, I will just leave it at that, and
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.080]  said, look, you are not going to stop a freedom movement in this country. And the only hope
[35:45.080 --> 35:51.160]  the Republicans have is to stop being such complete sellouts and Rand Paul has actually
[35:51.160 --> 35:52.160]  infiltrated them.
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.080]  They have not infiltrated him. And I have been told it is the same thing with Ted Cruz
[35:57.080 --> 36:01.160]  that is yet to be seen, but I am starting to believe it. And what I found is people
[36:01.160 --> 36:05.720]  just cannot believe we can win. They cannot believe we can reverse things. Well, my ancestors,
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.080]  all they did was win, or they died trying.
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.600]  And I am tired of this loser idea that we do not have any power and a bunch of globalists
[36:12.600 --> 36:15.840]  scum are better than us just because they have got the money. They have got the money
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.640]  through fraud. And they want to get rid of the free market and our ladder out of this
[36:21.640 --> 36:24.680]  so that they are up there and we are down here.
[36:24.680 --> 36:28.720]  I want to empower all of humanity, so that is coming up. But here is Mitch McConnell
[36:28.720 --> 36:34.920]  being forced to say demand answers so they get the political support to impeach and prosecute.
[36:34.920 --> 36:40.200]  And I am telling you folks, people now know that the IRS is a collection agency for the
[36:40.200 --> 36:46.120]  fellow reserve. People now know that the ultra-rich are all exempt. It is the end of these people
[36:46.120 --> 36:49.760]  if you want it, if you believe it, if you decide you have power.
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.320]  I know why the yuppies decide they do not have power and just kind of lay in the ditch.
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.320]  Because they do not believe you can do anything. They have low esteem for themselves, so they
[36:59.320 --> 37:03.760]  just say I am just going to enjoy life, eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[37:03.760 --> 37:10.960]  No, how about educate yourself, get informed, get involved. The animating contest of liberty
[37:10.960 --> 37:17.280]  is the stairway to the stars. And then eat, drink, and be merry in your off time. Work
[37:17.280 --> 37:19.420]  hard, play hard, win, win, win.
[37:19.420 --> 37:24.100]  You are not happy because you are jellyfish. You are not happy because you are seething
[37:24.100 --> 37:32.560]  with weakness instead of seething with power. And I mean love and goodness and also a healthy
[37:32.560 --> 37:38.120]  dose of a little crazed. That's what it is to be human. That's why they want you dumb
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.140]  down and sedate cuz they know our natural order.
[37:42.140 --> 37:46.940]  And they sure know the people that colonized this country were some of the most crazed,
[37:46.940 --> 37:54.520]  wild-eyed, intelligent, free people out there. The globalists fancy themselves as cultured
[37:54.520 --> 38:02.800]  wild men. They are not. They are cultured scum. In a culture of sess, we are the future,
[38:02.800 --> 38:09.840]  but we, the people that have empathy and care and who have goodwill, we must also tune into
[38:09.840 --> 38:17.660]  our resistance side and our animal war side to wage war with information and with focus
[38:17.660 --> 38:27.440]  and intellect, but with an overdriving electrical charge of annihilation against the enemy.
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.720]  Crush them. Crush them. And I mean, that's all you've got to do is decide you are the
[38:33.720 --> 38:39.200]  future. I'm just sick of all this scum sucking off of us and then telling us it's a favor
[38:39.200 --> 38:41.520]  because they can't believe they've gotten away with all this.
[38:41.520 --> 38:45.360]  They're scared of us and they wanna stick their hands down our pants to break our will.
[38:45.360 --> 38:47.880]  We're going to our guest here in a moment cuz she's got a split in about 20 minutes
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.760]  ago to her college class. But right now, let's go ahead and go to Mitch McConnell. This is
[38:53.760 --> 38:58.680]  the type of TV ad we need to see. This is the type of stuff that will defeat the collectivist.
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.200]  If we don't defeat them, they're gonna use their mass of dumbed down serfs to take our
[39:03.200 --> 39:06.280]  guns, our property, our children, everything.
[39:06.280 --> 39:11.520]  They hate those of us that are successful. The minions of the globalist and the globalist
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.760]  themselves. We're stuck between corrupt elites that are threatened by goodness and beauty
[39:15.760 --> 39:21.560]  and honor and strength and real power and giant masses of thumb-sucking scum who are
[39:21.560 --> 39:24.600]  victims and handicapped, basically, that I wanna empower.
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.800]  But we may not be able to empower them. So we've got to take over the system now. We
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.280]  either take the system back or we're slaves. And I am not getting on my knees to suck the
[39:35.280 --> 39:41.000]  boots of lesser men. You understand that? I wanna be able to be in a free society and
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.760]  be involved in free expression and free society.
[39:44.760 --> 39:49.200]  And hang around who I want and live where I want and do what I want and worship what
[39:49.200 --> 39:56.880]  I want and build what I want and not have a bunch of scum on my back. Let's go to this
[39:56.880 --> 39:59.700]  clip and then we'll go to our guest.
[39:59.700 --> 40:03.120]  Here from Republican leader of the US Senate, Mitch McConnell.
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.480]  Again and again, this administration and its allies have used the resources of the government
[40:07.480 --> 40:14.600]  itself to intimidate or silence those who question or oppose it. I don't know about
[40:14.600 --> 40:18.680]  you, but I think that the leader of the free world and his advisors have better things
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.760]  to do than dig through other people's tax returns.
[40:22.760 --> 40:26.360]  A number of Tea Party groups had complained and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.160]  wrote to the IRS to complain that they were being harassed.
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.160]  There's absolutely no target earlier this year. Dozens of Tea Party affiliated groups
[40:35.160 --> 40:39.880]  across the country learned what it was like to draw the attention of the speech police
[40:39.880 --> 40:45.680]  when they received a lengthy questionnaire from the IRS demanding, listen to this, demanding
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.620]  attendance list, meetings, transcripts, and donor information.
[40:50.620 --> 40:54.320]  What they're trying to do is intimidate donors to outside groups that are critical
[40:54.320 --> 41:02.200]  of the administration. They've got the IRS, the SEC, and other agencies going after contributors.
[41:02.200 --> 41:07.940]  The internal revenue service admitted today that some of its employees targeted conservative
[41:07.940 --> 41:08.940]  political groups.
[41:08.940 --> 41:09.940]  This is outrageous.
[41:09.940 --> 41:13.940]  I told you this years ago, folks, this is the conspiracy theorist.
[41:13.940 --> 41:17.140]  The internal revenue service to target.
[41:17.140 --> 41:19.880]  There is a culture of intimidation throughout the administration.
[41:19.880 --> 41:22.040]  IRS began singling out Tea Party groups.
[41:22.040 --> 41:25.840]  You have any kind of conservative leaning background affiliation, they're going to
[41:25.840 --> 41:28.400]  target you and come after you. This is a speculation.
[41:28.400 --> 41:31.040]  They take their kids. They arrest homeschoolers.
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.600]  The things that drive the Obama economy and they drive an ideological agenda that, as
[41:35.600 --> 41:43.680]  we have seen again and again, has little regard for those who dissent. No president from either
[41:43.680 --> 41:47.520]  party is more powerful than the Constitution of the United States.
[41:47.520 --> 41:52.240]  Today, Lerner will invoke her Fifth Amendment right and refuse to answer questions.
[41:52.240 --> 41:55.840]  I will not answer any questions or testify about the subject matter of this committee's
[41:55.840 --> 41:56.840]  meeting.
[41:56.840 --> 41:57.840]  Didn't know at that time.
[41:57.840 --> 41:58.960]  I am not aware of that.
[41:58.960 --> 42:00.440]  I don't know.
[42:00.440 --> 42:02.600]  I have no memory of anyone doing that.
[42:02.600 --> 42:03.600]  I didn't know that.
[42:03.600 --> 42:06.480]  I'm not personally responsible.
[42:06.480 --> 42:08.000]  Do you believe it is illegal?
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  I don't believe it is.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.640]  But when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.
[42:11.640 --> 42:14.720]  What does the president believe? Does the president believe that would be illegal?
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.240]  The law here? The law is irrelevant.
[42:18.240 --> 42:24.120]  The law is irrelevant. Intimidation, retaliation, secretive.
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.600]  Our enemies reward our friends.
[42:26.600 --> 42:32.240]  Yeah, we'll go after our enemies, reward our friends. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.200]  here's the issue. If the Republicans actually burn Obama for this, it will set a precedent
[42:36.200 --> 42:37.560]  where they can't get away with it.
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.800]  I got to say, Republicans don't usually use the IRS against people since Nixon. And that
[42:41.800 --> 42:48.480]  was about 100 enemies. Folks, everyone I know that's a pro-lifer, a pastor, even people
[42:48.480 --> 42:52.760]  that are pro-government get audited and told, watch what you say and we'll leave you alone,
[42:52.760 --> 42:53.760]  to scare people.
[42:53.760 --> 42:59.200]  This is the essence of oppression. Some of those IRS people, including the IRS director,
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.760]  Aaron Dykes and the crew went out a few years ago when they did a press conference and they
[43:02.760 --> 43:06.240]  intimidated them and tried to send police after them for asking questions about the
[43:06.240 --> 43:08.720]  Federal Reserve being private.
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.760]  These are people that bug their eyes out at you and try to have men in black intimidate
[43:12.760 --> 43:19.040]  you because they know what they're doing is wrong. And that's what the TSA is all about.
[43:19.040 --> 43:25.600]  Our government publicly runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria now, that's on record.
[43:25.600 --> 43:30.600]  And finally, Rand Paul's talking about it saying, why are we funding Al-Qaeda? And then
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.840]  when you go to the airport, they single out, I've seen it, attractive women especially,
[43:35.840 --> 43:39.080]  or if it's guys that are walking around Nelly as it gets.
[43:39.080 --> 43:43.520]  They see guys they like, they single you out, and they literally salivate when they do this.
[43:43.520 --> 43:49.800]  Now others don't like doing it, but it's quote their job, they'll do fake pat downs. I've
[43:49.800 --> 43:53.480]  seen it done, I've had it done to my crew, where they act like they're touching you and
[43:53.480 --> 43:54.680]  going, I don't like doing this.
[43:54.680 --> 43:59.080]  They actually talk under their breath, like ventriloquist, I hear you, I don't like this,
[43:59.080 --> 44:02.720]  I'm a listener, it's just a good paying job. We wanna unionize, we don't wanna have to
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.600]  do this. I've been told that scores of times, but doesn't matter, the supervisors are the
[44:07.600 --> 44:10.560]  ones that get off on it.
[44:10.560 --> 44:16.520]  And her story from infowars.com went viral, dozens of newspapers picked it up, anti TSA
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.920]  activists, TSA agent groped my vagina is the headline. Woman complains of sexual molestation
[44:22.920 --> 44:36.000]  after frothing TSA opt-out protest, after fronting TSA opt-out protest.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.240]  But the point is an activist who, I guess Watson wrote this, I guess that's a British
[44:41.240 --> 44:47.380]  way to say it. An activist who fronted a national TSA, kind of led a national TSA opt-out campaign
[44:47.380 --> 44:54.680]  last year, has released a video of a pat down during which she accused the TSA agent of
[44:54.680 --> 44:57.240]  touching her.
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.040]  And now that video has gone viral and has been picked up again by New York Daily News,
[45:02.040 --> 45:06.880]  the Daily Mail, you name it, but she was then interviewed by several TV networks and it
[45:06.880 --> 45:11.340]  never aired. And the point is, is if they can take your kids to a private room or take
[45:11.340 --> 45:17.020]  your kids and pull their shirt off or grab their groin or even go in your pants and then
[45:17.020 --> 45:19.680]  deny it or then say it's okay.
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.340]  And then Texas tries to pass a law saying you can't do it. Huffington Post covered it,
[45:25.340 --> 45:30.340]  Ashley Jessica, student activist says she was violated during TSA pat down in the video.
[45:30.340 --> 45:34.400]  They all picked it up. And then if they can normalize this, they can get away with anywhere,
[45:34.400 --> 45:37.880]  the highways, the roads, you name it, and it's now starting.
[45:37.880 --> 45:42.960]  It's about government treating you that you're all suspects, you're all criminals. Prisoners
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.480]  have to be groped like this in medium and maximum security prisons. So this is turning
[45:47.480 --> 45:52.680]  everything into a giant prison with Walmart telescreens saying, watch your neighbors.
[45:52.680 --> 45:56.960]  And so we take you now to Ashley Jessica. Ashley, thanks for coming on with us. What
[45:56.960 --> 46:01.880]  do you make of this becoming a big story? And then what do you make of CNN and others
[46:01.880 --> 46:04.320]  interviewing you but not airing it?
[46:04.320 --> 46:08.620]  I'm completely in shock that this has become such a big story because of all of the other
[46:08.620 --> 46:13.360]  abuses that the TSA has engaged in over the past few years. You know, where was the mainstream
[46:13.360 --> 46:21.800]  media coverage when the TSA was humiliating cancer survivors or exposing people's breasts,
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.880]  you know, puncturing people's urostomy bags? Like, why wasn't that completely blown up
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.000]  in the media? I feel like they are latching onto this. They're trying to make it seem
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.680]  like I've blown everything out of proportion. They're overstating the claims that I have
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.720]  made about this. All I said was that she touched my vagina. You can clearly see her hands make
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.880]  contact with that area in the video. After she does it, she says, I'm going to explain
[46:47.880 --> 46:52.600]  to you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go all the way up your leg until my hand meets
[46:52.600 --> 46:58.200]  resistance. It's going to hit first and then come back down. She's very vocal about what
[46:58.200 --> 47:06.100]  she's going to do. Basically, this is a pat down that happens quite frequently. This isn't
[47:06.100 --> 47:07.360]  anything out of the ordinary.
[47:07.360 --> 47:14.280]  Oh no, I've witnessed people grab, you know, Jesse Ventura's genitals and then even what
[47:14.280 --> 47:20.200]  really made him mad was go back, you know, into his gluteus maximus and people say, oh,
[47:20.200 --> 47:25.200]  you ought to pay for that. It is a violation. If somebody did this to you in a park, they'd
[47:25.200 --> 47:29.680]  get 15 years in prison, but they're doing it to make sure there's not a bin Laden in
[47:29.680 --> 47:30.680]  your pants.
[47:30.680 --> 47:31.680]  Exactly.
[47:31.680 --> 47:34.840]  Ashley, is bin Laden hiding in your underwear?
[47:34.840 --> 47:40.960]  No, he is not. They actually didn't find him during the search. Shockingly enough.
[47:40.960 --> 47:43.440]  Well, every criminal says they're innocent.
[47:43.440 --> 47:49.720]  Right. And they haven't found any weapons in women's underwear or anyone's underwear
[47:49.720 --> 47:55.520]  for that matter with all of these broke downs and all of the enhanced security that's been
[47:55.520 --> 47:57.080]  implemented.
[47:57.080 --> 48:01.400]  Have you ever gone through it where they're clearly enjoying it?
[48:01.400 --> 48:07.160]  Last year in Virginia, I had a TSA agent who ordered me around like a prisoner. It seemed
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.960]  like she was enjoying the power of it all. She was the one who told me she's going to
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.240]  touch my behind over and over again until I don't flinch.
[48:15.240 --> 48:17.760]  Oh, no, it's bizarre.
[48:17.760 --> 48:18.760]  It's completely bizarre.
[48:18.760 --> 48:26.120]  I mean, I had a guy pat me down and I mean, he was just ready to go. I mean, it was smacking,
[48:26.120 --> 48:31.120]  talking to me in my purring voice. And I was just like, this is beyond bizarre. I mean,
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.120]  it's incredible.
[48:32.120 --> 48:37.800]  It is. And I mean, these TSA agents, they were polite, but she still touched my vagina
[48:37.800 --> 48:42.520]  with her hand. So people, some people are saying, oh, you know, they were polite. You're
[48:42.520 --> 48:46.680]  making too big a deal of it. I don't care how polite you are. That is a violation.
[48:46.680 --> 48:51.040]  Well, Miss USA said they went in her pants and in her body and broke down crying. They've
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.520]  had airline pilots till they revolted and said, we were allowed to fly the plane. We're
[48:54.520 --> 48:58.520]  gonna do this to us. You know, their union said no, so they quit. They had guys going,
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.080]  having to go home and having to vomit because it is, this is a form of rape. That's what
[49:03.080 --> 49:05.520]  it is.
[49:05.520 --> 49:10.360]  It's completely out of control. I'm in shock that this is considered normal. To even have
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.160]  to be searched for, if innocent people are being searched without probable cause, we've
[49:14.160 --> 49:15.160]  headed into tyranny.
[49:15.160 --> 49:18.520]  Well, listen, Jesse Ventura is a really nice, I've got to know him really well, but really
[49:18.520 --> 49:24.040]  aggressive guy. And you know, a normal aggressive guy is not gonna have some man putting his
[49:24.040 --> 49:30.360]  hand up. And Ventura's like, I'm leaving, I'm leaving this country, he's in East Germany.
[49:30.360 --> 49:35.040]  Because it's normal to not want someone to literally go in between your butt cheeks.
[49:35.040 --> 49:40.040]  I mean, I'm sorry to have to talk like this, but it's weird. I mean, it's weird.
[49:40.040 --> 49:44.240]  It's bizarre. I mean, I've been getting so much support and so many people thanking me
[49:44.240 --> 49:49.320]  for doing this. But other people are saying, because I was filming the pat down, I was
[49:49.320 --> 49:53.600]  instigating it. I was looking for trouble, which is completely not true.
[49:53.600 --> 49:56.280]  Well, it's a good thing you were wearing baggy pants. If you were wearing a skirt, they would
[49:56.280 --> 49:58.480]  have said you were asking to be raped.
[49:58.480 --> 50:02.000]  I mean, yeah. People have said things like that before.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  Don't wear lipstick, honey. You're the one asking for it.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  Exactly. Saying I'm asking for attention by this? No, I had my camera rolling because
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.640]  last year in Virginia, as soon as my brother turned on his camera, everything changed.
[50:14.640 --> 50:19.240]  I was given a very respectful pat down on camera in which she didn't even come near
[50:19.240 --> 50:25.800]  my private parts. And she said, but when we opted out, she said, I just have to let you
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.000]  know that you're gonna be given an extensive pat down and I'm gonna have to go all the
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.600]  way up your leg with my hand until the thigh meets the torso.
[50:34.600 --> 50:38.280]  That's right. Go in a radiation machine. Let us save the naked image, which they've been
[50:38.280 --> 50:43.320]  caught doing. Or let me look inside your area.
[50:43.320 --> 50:47.760]  Right. So, of course, after she said that, I'm going to want to film and I'm going to
[50:47.760 --> 50:48.760]  want to warn them.
[50:48.760 --> 50:52.840]  No, no. But see how you're even responding to the trolls? That's why the mainstream media
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.680]  is dying because they're attacking a woman, having her private parts grabbed and everybody
[50:57.680 --> 51:00.720]  knows this is wrong.
[51:00.720 --> 51:05.040]  Wouldn't it be nice to have one product that replaces more than 10, saving you space, time
[51:05.040 --> 51:06.040]  and money?

[51:30.060 --> 51:34.280]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[51:34.280 --> 51:38.520]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[51:38.520 --> 51:42.640]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[51:42.640 --> 51:46.040]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[51:46.040 --> 51:47.040]  army?

[51:57.680 --> 52:05.360]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for
[52:05.360 --> 52:10.800]  all of us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[52:10.800 --> 52:16.200]  your liberty, freedom and security and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[52:16.200 --> 52:21.720]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[52:21.720 --> 52:26.360]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.960]  way you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The
[52:30.960 --> 52:36.380]  do-it-yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer
[52:36.380 --> 52:41.880]  be provided. This, along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional
[52:41.880 --> 52:48.000]  government control of food supplies and resources, says food is the ultimate priority. eFoods
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.200]  Direct will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633

[53:10.400 --> 53:14.680]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could

[53:20.160 --> 53:24.600]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[53:57.760 --> 53:59.160]  It's the only one you've got.
[53:59.160 --> 54:14.000]  Coming up, I'm going to get into the latest on the economy, the latest on IRS, Spygate,
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  Benghazigate. Your phone calls in the next hour and we have an in-studio guest who was
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  censored by Facebook, but Bill O'Reilly thinks that's just great and says they should censor
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.280]  the alternative media more. And that I'm the person that needs to be censored, number one,
[54:29.280 --> 54:34.800]  because I'm angry. I'm angry about all this corruption. I'm trying to get people motivated.
[54:34.800 --> 54:42.280]  That's just terrible. We should only watch MSNBC and Bill O'Reilly. That's right, Rachel
[54:42.280 --> 54:50.480]  Maddow and Bill O'Reilly. They're all attacking. They've got Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, not even
[54:50.480 --> 54:56.320]  so much Esquire. I don't know they've done that. GQ. Man, I'm getting called by all sorts
[54:56.320 --> 54:57.800]  of people that have known me over the decades.
[54:57.800 --> 55:01.280]  When I'm getting all these media calls, I mean, they're like, dig something up. And
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.680]  I have nothing to be ashamed of, folks. Whatever they dig up, if they spin it or whatever,
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.800]  it's not true or it's exaggerated. Cuz I sit there and think, what have I done? What's
[55:09.800 --> 55:14.080]  wrong? And I'm like, it's the opposite. If people knew my past, my history, it sounds
[55:14.080 --> 55:15.220]  like a movie.
[55:15.220 --> 55:21.760]  And so it's like, well, they're just gonna discover. Anyways, the point is, is that the
[55:21.760 --> 55:25.920]  new magazine is out. And I'm gonna cover it in the next hour for TV viewers and radio
[55:25.920 --> 55:32.160]  listeners. But it's the double cover, Bilderberg edition. You can see the cover at infowarstore.com
[55:32.160 --> 55:36.020]  with the head of Google on the cover.
[55:36.020 --> 55:39.400]  That's all I'm gonna say. I'm gonna leave it at that. Going back to somebody who I just
[55:39.400 --> 55:43.120]  love the work she's been doing on so many issues. Ashley Jessica has helped lead the
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.840]  national opt-out demonstrations the last few years. That's what Watson means by fronting
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.320]  in his headline, fronting the national opt-out.
[55:51.320 --> 55:54.880]  And if they can get away with the TSA, they can get away with anything. Now, Ashley, I've
[55:54.880 --> 55:58.760]  been throwing out some of the points here. Your YouTube is youtube.com forward slash
[55:58.760 --> 56:07.060]  user forward slash Miss Ashley Jessica. And your Twitter is Ashley Jessica, so twitter.com
[56:07.060 --> 56:11.720]  forward slash Ashley Jessica. But what are points you think are important to get across
[56:11.720 --> 56:13.440]  here?
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.360]  First of all, one thing I wanna say is that, you know, sometimes they only just have the
[56:17.360 --> 56:22.240]  metal detector line open. And they shuffle people through that. People go through, you
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.360]  know, no problems. And then suddenly they decide certain people need to go through the
[56:26.360 --> 56:30.120]  scanner. And if they don't go through the scanner or get patted down, they're suddenly
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.980]  a security risk. It's a completely arbitrary process. It's nothing more than security theater.
[56:35.980 --> 56:41.880]  It's just completely out of control. I just, the main point is that we cannot normalize
[56:41.880 --> 56:43.840]  this type of treatment.
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.840]  There is no excuse for people to be putting their hands anywhere near someone's private
[56:48.840 --> 56:51.480]  areas in the name of protecting national security.
[56:51.480 --> 56:57.080]  Well, it makes you all guilty now. Again, it's prisoner training and the government
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.920]  runs Al-Qaeda now. You know, I'm thinking about a national demonstration with a fact
[57:01.920 --> 57:07.440]  sheet with mainstream headlines about the government funding Al-Qaeda, running Al-Qaeda,
[57:07.440 --> 57:13.780]  protecting Al-Qaeda. And then hand those out at the airports like you've done. You've led
[57:13.780 --> 57:15.840]  protest handing out info at the airport.
[57:15.840 --> 57:20.680]  Exactly. I handed out fliers about the health risks associated with the body scanners. Some
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.240]  people think now that because the backscatter scanners are gonna be phased out that the
[57:25.240 --> 57:29.780]  millimeter scanners are safe. And the TSA tells everyone, she told me she's required
[57:29.780 --> 57:33.440]  to tell me that it gives off less radiation than a cell phone.
[57:33.440 --> 57:38.800]  But in fact, it has never been independently certified as safe for anybody. And the independent
[57:38.800 --> 57:45.920]  research shows that the terahertz radio waves can unzip DNA. So that doesn't sound too comforting
[57:45.920 --> 57:49.320]  to me. I don't want a chance going through that.
[57:49.320 --> 57:53.160]  And again, remember four years ago when I started really focusing on this and Drudge
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.320]  started posting my articles almost every week or sometimes every day and it became a big
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.960]  national story. They would say, we're not groping anybody. We don't take old people
[58:01.960 --> 58:05.200]  in private rooms and strip them. We don't make old people get out of wheelchairs that
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.200]  can't walk.
[58:06.200 --> 58:11.360]  And then in which video after video showing how they're liars, it is a criminal takeover.
[58:11.360 --> 58:17.320]  Yeah. And I get emails from people who are rape survivors telling me that they're afraid
[58:17.320 --> 58:22.280]  to go to the airport because they don't wanna be touched like that. Imagine how triggering
[58:22.280 --> 58:25.600]  and re-traumatizing that can be for someone who is a victim of sexual assault.
[58:25.600 --> 58:29.880]  We've had top psychologists say it's training little kids to be touched. You teach them
[58:29.880 --> 58:34.080]  no people touch you unless it's a perv in a uniform. And there's the videos of them
[58:34.080 --> 58:43.280]  stripping little kids, going in baby's diapers. This is a joke. This is over the top.
[58:43.280 --> 58:50.920]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.920 --> 58:55.640]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[58:55.640 --> 59:00.400]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[59:00.400 --> 59:05.840]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:28.960]  All right, if you just joined us, we're into the second hour. Ashley Jessica does some
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.720]  auxiliary reporting for info.wars.com. She's going to be at Goldberg this year. She's led
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.640]  national opt-out demonstrations, handed out radiation, warning info to people at the airports,
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:45.480]  done just a great job across the board, and she got groped, her and her friend, at the
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.160]  Atlanta airport and videotaped it, and she's not supposed to videotape that. That shows
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.320]  that, I mean, how dare her not want to have her private parts touched? This is all part
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.360]  of dominating the public, but get into the media that did interview you. This has become
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.440]  an actual story. It's been, I don't know, over 15 papers, but you talked to CNN and
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:10.920]  others, and they never aired the interviews. Well, I talked to CNN. They were doing a phone
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.560]  type of interview. They were taking notes on what I was saying, and then I started telling
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.320]  them the facts about the body scanners and how the TSA has never got a terrorist, just
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.680]  laying out all the facts, and then they said to me they weren't sure if they were going
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.480]  to use the story anymore because they had extreme weather that came up that they need
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:34.680]  to report on. I don't know. Yeah, they always say something else happened, like kind of
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.760]  when they're having the IRS hearings, they cut to a video from the day before with Anderson
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:45.120]  Cooper talking about gangs, and then as Watson was telling me about all this, you also got
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.080]  interviewed by some other national TV? Yeah, I was interviewed by Inside Edition. I did
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.960]  a Skype interview with them, but it never aired. I was saying in the Skype interview,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.860]  I said, we all need to opt out of the body scanner. We all need to film our pat downs
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:04.140]  and hold the TSA accountable and reassert our rights. That was one of the main points
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.200]  that I had said in that interview. Well, look, the good news is you did videotape it, so
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.120]  now there's exposure on it because they don't want this even discussed. I mean, as I said
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.940]  before I went to break, remember four years ago, three years ago, even two years ago,
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:21.400]  they would deny any of this was even going on. Exactly, and now people are saying, like
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:27.480]  the trolls, they're saying like, no, this is for our safety. This is normal now. You
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.220]  have to get your privates touch. Well, it's obvious. I mean, a lot of the trolls are just
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.120]  government paid minions or they're people so invested in the system, they're going to
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:45.400]  make excuses no matter what happens. Exactly, but good thing the liberty lovers are supporting
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.680]  and bringing attention to this. And, you know, there's been a back and forth in the comments
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:58.960]  on my video, lots of info where supporters, you know, laying down the facts and exposing
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.960]  everything. So that's great. I mean, there she went on the video, pal, right up there
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.860]  in the junk. And I mean, look, I mean, even with your wife or your girlfriend, if they're
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.520]  not in the mood and you just reach over and grab them, they're not going to like it. I
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.120]  mean, this is a stranger doing it. How have we gotten this far down the road here?
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:25.400]  I have no idea. And, you know, even when she came to my breast area, when she moved her
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.440]  hand towards me, my natural instinct, if a stranger is moving their hands toward that
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:37.200]  area is to move back. You know, that's normal. If someone came up to you or to me in the
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:43.040]  street and did that, I wouldn't be so polite. You know, well, they go to jail. I mean, if
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.240]  somebody walked over and grabbed my crotch, they're going to get punched in the nose.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.560]  Right. That's a normal reaction. It seems people have habituated to this. They've been
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.200]  completely pacified and brainwashed. I can't even it still blows my mind. I can't even
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.200]  figure it out.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.200]  Well, by the way, Rob do saw this happen and even got some of it on tape. We got back from
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.760]  a talker speech I gave the keynote address in New York a few years ago. And this guy
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.680]  walks up, big, mean looking prison guy. And it says, you know, hello, Mr. Jones, and then
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:20.520]  grabs both of my pectorals and tries to do a twister. It was excruciating, but I knew
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.960]  it was a setup and then call the police and they put him in handcuffs. We're going to
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.560]  arrest him. And then I went, you know, this is a setup. I said, you know, just know I
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.840]  could have sent you to jail and I left, but they wanted me to get in a fight.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.360]  I mean, I mean, it's kind of like what they kind of said they did to Garrison in airports
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.360]  and things. I've got to really watch my back. So folks pray for us. I'll see you at Bilderberg.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.500]  You are going, correct? Yes, absolutely. All right. Look forward to your reporting for
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.120]  info wars.com. They're very, very exciting. Ashley, Jessica, look forward to meeting
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.960]  in person. Thank you so much. A good job getting this report out and standing up to the abuse
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960]  they engaged in.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.960]  Thank you so much. We'll be back with a bunch of other news folks. Stay with us.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.360]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:10.500]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:16.000]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.180]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:28.220]  info worst team.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds

[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.540]  in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to info

[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.800]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.880]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.260]  your liberty, freedom and security and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:21.800]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.640]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:31.900]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do-it-yourself
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:37.920]  public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided. This,
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.400]  along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.580]  control of food supplies and resources, says food is the ultimate priority. e Foods Direct
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:55.320]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:41.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are 35 seconds back into the live transmission here in the second
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:49.160]  hour, 8.40, into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast and we are going to be here for
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:57.560]  another two hours or so. We are going to have in studio a well-known autism activist, Andrea
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:04.560]  Llamas, and she posted Facebook photos of her children at the March Against Monsanto
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:12.280]  and Facebook suspended her account and thousands of other people's accounts and naturalnews.com
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.800]  showed screenshots of that, drugsreport.com linked to it. Thank God exposing nationally
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:25.240]  internationally the censorship. We've posted Navy Seals official link on Facebook where
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:31.200]  they pointed out that they were left to die in Benghazi and had our Facebook suspended.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.720]  Other people had them suspended or completely deleted. It doesn't matter if you're an anti-war
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.920]  group. It doesn't matter if you're an anti-GMO group. It doesn't matter if you're a pro-raw
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:50.720]  milk group. It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter who you are. The system
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.640]  will come in if you are not on the globalist reservation on their plantation and Facebook
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.400]  will block you and they violate their own terms of use. They act like it's a big public
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.360]  commons. Your data is there. You make Facebook what it is just like you make YouTube what
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.760]  it is and then they selectively censor and manipulate. So we're going to get into that
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:15.560]  and how it ties into Bill O'Reilly smears yours truly Alex Jones in a hate speech rant
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:21.280]  talking about sexual hate speech and racist hate speech and then they cut to a clip of
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.440]  me out of context to make it sound like I'm involved in that.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.400]  I mean it's just they are desperate. You've got MSNBC. You've got Bill O'Reilly. You've
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:40.360]  got the White House coming after us. You've got you've got let's not exaggerate at least
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:47.640]  ten different investigative journalist groups. Some of them are whole teams Bloomberg now
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:54.560]  I've learned has three people full time in the last two weeks on us digging through everything
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.120]  and they're getting pretty upset right now.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:07.040]  I would imagine because there's just nothing there and there have been four different media
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.300]  groups that go I want to follow you to build a bird and I go OK go ahead and they go we
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:16.960]  have a big budget let me go wherever I want. I mean some of these are big famous writers
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.720]  and you know done biggest profiles out there you know top two or three profilers in the
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720]  countries.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.960]  I guess how the top five like two of them and then they call back no yeah they're not
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:32.520]  letting me go or cover that. Bilderberg's office you know off limits. Posada non grata
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:44.080]  how do you say that in Spanish is that right? Did I butcher that? Yeah I'm correct. OK good.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:50.080]  Anyways we've got all of this going on. Why are they so scared? Because we know what we're
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.120]  talking about. We have got the eye of the tiger when it comes to fighting these globalists.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.880]  We're committed. They know we're real. They know we're getting traction and they're scared.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.360]  And if you go to info wars dot com forward slash Bilderberg or just forward slash big
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.640]  I'll take you there to info wars dot com forward slash Bilderberg.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.600]  It says six days five hours forty seven minutes forty seven seconds till Bilderberg officially
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  kicks off next Thursday. But it really is kicked off already all the stuff that's happening
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.720]  the live video feeds the audio feeds the photos our reporters are already there breaking inside
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:31.440]  Intel. That's a great site Max Cabrera in IT built or in web development but we probably
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.520]  want to put that count down at the bottom and just point out that coverage has already
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:41.120]  begun and I'm going to be in England by Monday and there is a bunch of news on that front.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.800]  Why is it important? You've got these top globalists who for decades said they didn't
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.560]  exist. Haha. You know Jim Tucker and Alex Jones say something called Bilderberg exists.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.960]  You know just five years ago the New York Times said that literally you can pull it
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.520]  up was in a film review for the film New World Order. It was four years ago reporting on
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:06.840]  something a year before and said Jones was in a parking lot at a Marriott hotel imagining
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.040]  that there were black sedans and men in sunglasses.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.700]  You know Jones was having a full out schizoid you know break with reality kind of like there's
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:22.000]  no amnesty in the amnesty plan. There's no two billion bullets. The IRS isn't spying
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.480]  on you or persecuting you. There's there's no terror neither. This TSA is not sticking
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.640]  their hands on your pants. Well we are but what's the big deal? You know you like it.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.600]  You know you wanted it. You know you wore that short skirt. You're trying to attract
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:43.960]  somebody honey. Well yeah I'm trying to attract somebody. It ain't you bud. Come on you know
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:52.720]  you like a pot-bellied man grabbing your genitals. What's the big deal? Never had that experience?
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:14:01.400]  You have now. Ever had a guy go up between your legs? You do now. You're a three-year-old.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.000]  Never been taken to a little cage and never taken a little box glass box for everybody
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.120]  had their arms put up hands up trained as a prisoner? Never had a guy with a weird mustache
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.520]  smack his lips and rub his hands all over your kids body? Never had that happen? Well
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.020]  here's your front row seat to it all and if you get upset about it you're an extremist.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:26.780]  It's hate speech if you say you hate not being able to fly because you won't subject your
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:36.520]  children and your wife and yourself. Jesse Ventura's wrong. You know he's not even doing
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.200]  his TV show this year. They've been calling me. I need to call them. I've been so busy.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:47.160]  I was basically offered Ventura's TV show or a spin-off thereof and I just I just said
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.200]  no because I've turned down. Not bragging. I'm telling you Bill O'Reilly wants to say
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.440]  I'm nobody and won't say my name when he attacks me almost on a monthly basis. When I've turned
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:11.040]  down Discovery Channel shows, Travel Channel shows, true TV shows, HBO, just you name it
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.000]  because I don't have time to fly around and shoot for a week per episode and shoot 12,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.520]  15 episodes and then make you know even brand-new shows that are highly paid $200,000 they don't
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.800]  pay for anything around here and then not do the radio show not do the news website.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:34.600]  See we have our own thing and as much as I like the you know the crew that did Ventura's
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.480]  show I think the overall did a great job. They're like so you don't want to fly out
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.960]  here and explore doing the show. They first brought to me like two years ago and I think
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.880]  they couldn't convince Ventura to do the next season. And Ventura's like you know what and
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.000]  who knows it might come back sometime. He's just I'm not flying. You're gonna have to
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.720]  get me private jets and that's what they do and that's above their budget. He goes I will
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:04.640]  not have people do that to me. There are people like you know grow up Jesse. I mean let people
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:13.320]  stand around going hi governor I like your TV show I liked you on WWE or you know WWF
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:23.480]  at the time whatever it was hey how's it going blah blah and he's sitting there getting angry.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.440]  And then Ventura like two days later every time we flown comes over and apologizes and
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.080]  goes sorry I've been grumpy because I've known Ventura when he didn't happen to fly he's
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.040]  a big teddy bear. But whenever that happens for like two days he's real angry. We almost
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.480]  gotten of not really in a fight but a big argument in a cab. He gets mad at everybody
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:45.000]  else because he's so angry about somebody rubbing the inside of his butt. I mean you
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.400]  know I mean I hate to have to sit here and talk about things like this on the radio but
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:54.240]  you know as a man it's really freaky. And I know why women get mad at this to sit there
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.740]  I don't want to keep talking about it. It just really hit me that they're criticizing
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:04.840]  Ashley Jessica. Sounds like a clothing line doesn't it? It's a great name. The point is
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:15.240]  that is that they're like how dare you not like them grabbing your crotch. I mean it's
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:23.160]  like listen you don't do that to somebody unless you know the lights are low and everybody's
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:30.240]  into it. And there's been some veno flowing and then they go and they get they do it to
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:39.120]  your kids man. And listen I never made a big deal out of this because you know it's private
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.600]  it's my family I'll get into it. I one time had TSA style security without me even knowing
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:52.440]  start groping my kids at a border and I flipped out. And so I mean I know it's just that's
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.120]  the line you're not crossing is my kids. So my wife's like the kids want to fly I want
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.520]  to fly. And I said fine you want to go to Europe where you grew up? I said you can go
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.000]  take a trip to Europe I'll keep the kids. You go with your friends to Europe. You know
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.840]  she her dad was a diplomat and so she grew up in France and grew up in Italy and grew
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:19.080]  up in Denmark. And she hasn't been back since college she went to college over there too.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.640]  And I said listen you've already experienced what happens when somebody grabs my kids.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:28.560]  I cannot handle this anymore. And if they can get away with this they can go with anything.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.560]  Okay here's some of the news I got coming up Bill O'Reilly smears Alex Jones at hate
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:38.040]  speech rant. This is the biggest sign yet because he does this routinely now that we're
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:43.960]  really having an effect when they trot out O'Reilly. And I mean he does this just because
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:48.800]  he knows that we're for real and he knows that our audience is bigger than his. I mean
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.080]  we have more viewers on YouTube every week than he has on Fox. He's got about five million
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.080]  different people that tune in at one time or another. Three million on a big night for
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.520]  him. People like well isn't that five times three million? No it's the same audience tuning
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.240]  in. And nothing against him we're all going to be old one day love old folks but his audience
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.520]  the reason his ratings are going down is his audience is dying. And there have been studies
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:17.440]  on that. And so every day there's less of them. And so he's really angry. You know he's
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.840]  an old tough guy reportedly and he's you know angry that you know that I'm not a sellout
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:33.800]  like him. And I'm not going to say anymore. The point is the point is is that the House
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:39.160]  Judiciary Chairman has come out and said that holders should design. That's good news. Navy
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:44.900]  considers 3D printable future fleet of drones. This is what we want. Robot factories building

[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.140]  of other just off the chart news. IRS crossed Green Line. Pro Israel Group felt wrath of
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:03.940]  Obama IRS. Web investigation reveals. There's been a disaster and most of you don't even
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:09.160]  realize the serious concern for all of us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:14.760]  the most important supply you can for your liberty freedom and security. And that's food.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:20.280]  We thought the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.720]  that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it or our food being sold to other
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.320]  countries. But here's the most effective way you'll lose your liberty and security without
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:35.420]  a fight. Government regulation. The do-it-yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:40.360]  canneries can no longer be provided. This along with the recent private gardening and
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:45.720]  farming regulations and additional government control of food supplies and resources says
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:51.240]  food is the ultimate priority. E Foods Direct will provide free shipping on all food orders

[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.100]  You know the reason I've spent a little bit of time on the O'Reilly thing is when you
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:34.480]  have Glenn Beck saying I'm a fascist and I'm a liar and I'm spooky and you've got CNN attacking
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:42.000]  me and lying about us and MSNBC and Bill O'Reilly, what does that tell you? The establishment
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.840]  is scared of things they don't control. And the fact that we are successful on air, the
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:56.440]  fact that by the grace of God and your prayers and support we are on air is a testimony that
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.320]  we can turn things around. But we've got to believe we can do that. But everybody in the
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:08.840]  office said they saw this Bill O'Reilly thing this morning from yesterday and they saw it
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:15.840]  and they just couldn't believe it. Here's the media-eyed story. Bill O'Reilly decries
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.660]  political hate speech graphic singles out Alex Jones. And they've got leftist authoritarian
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:29.240]  groups praising O'Reilly, saying good, shut down people like Alex Jones.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.740]  But then others going, well, wait, you're hateful too. What is hate speech? The Soviets
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:37.800]  developed this back in the 30s and would send people to gulags saying it's hateful to talk
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.320]  bad about communism. It's hateful to talk about how we shut down your churches. It's
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.000]  not hateful when we take you to a forced labor camp or rape your family or shoot you in the
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.280]  back of the head.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:54.080]  And now I have an article that Watson is going to come on dealing with after the break, where
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.160]  you've heard Scotland is doing what Germany's doing, trying to ban homeschooling and things,
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:06.800]  and saying every child at birth will have a social worker assigned to them who is their
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:15.080]  government parent. And now midwives are ordered to spy on parents to see if they say anything
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.720]  about open borders or immigrants, and then their children will be taken.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.000]  See, the shtazi want your kids. But don't say the government's bad or we'll have to
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.040]  take your kids. And then Bill O'Reilly comes out and praises Facebook for shutting down
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.960]  hate speech and sex hate speech. And if you call and say, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.880]  rape you, that is a terroristic threat.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.280]  But what is hate speech? Hate speech is saying things they don't like. What does the ADL
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.640]  and Southern Poverty Law Center say? I'm hate speech, I need to be shut down. These are
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.840]  authoritarians that call ending the First Amendment, just like the IRS is trying to
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.760]  do with pro-life groups and Christian groups and tea parties. They call that hate speech.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.240]  I've got clips of MSNBC saying the Tea Party is hate speech. Good, have the IRS shut them
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.520]  down.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.280]  And then Bill O'Reilly, even if I was a racist Ku Klux Klan show, which I would disagree
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.880]  with, I'm trying to bring humanity together, that people have that First Amendment right
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:20.400]  to free speech. Because if you take the Klan people's stuff away, or the new Black Panther
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.480]  Party, especially the Black Klan, if you take their rights away, or Metro, or La Raza, or
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.060]  all the Hispanic supremacist groups, if you take their speech away, you will lose yours
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:34.840]  as well. Now O'Reilly, like something out of 1984, went past the deception of Rachel
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.800]  Maddow and others, where she said, I said Obama sent the tornado.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.040]  I said no such thing. A caller asked, is this government? I think it is. And I said, no,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.300]  I don't think it is. Probably a real tornado, but they can create hurricanes and stuff.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:51.820]  There is weather weapons, and I've read like National Geographic headlines on the air.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:55.880]  They edited that out. So why are they doing this now? He does this incredibly deceptive
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:04.160]  piece where he just flashes me up there ranting out of context in between sexual hate speech,
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.160]  whatever that means.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.700]  Like I'm doing sexual stuff when he's the guy who settled cases out of court, punch
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:15.380]  up Infowars. I mean, look at what a perv this guy looks like. No wonder he can't get women.
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:18.640]  Let's punch O'Reilly up. You were a woman, would you want to get anywhere near that guy?
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.880]  It's like a giant ferret or something. Let's go to a clip of O'Reilly, here he is.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:30.720]  Tonight. There's only so many stupid people out there, Republicans. Admittedly, they breathe
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.640]  kind of fast because they're too dumb. You know what it's like to go to sleep every night
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.840]  knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you back at the Republican end
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.200]  up killing me one day? Hate speech. Now Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.400]  But can anything be done to stop the hatred, which is directly linked into the IRS Tea
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:56.720]  Party scandal. We'll have a factor investigation. All right. Hate speech and the IRS scandal.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.180]  Stop right there. I'm not going to go any more of it. The full thing's up on infowars.com.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:07.840]  But first they have Randy Rhodes on her little show on whatever's left of Air America, like
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:14.080]  15 stations or something, saying Republicans breathe fast and are stupid. So that's hate
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.800]  speech. No, that's her right to be obsessed with how smart liberals are.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.800]  When we've gone out and seen your supporters, they are the dumbest people. They hardly have
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:30.520]  a pulse. I mean, the jellyfish have more brain cells. Then they sandwich it in with me and
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:36.080]  then go into a piece about sex stuff just to imply I'm a Democrat. I'm attacking the
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:46.360]  Tea Party and I'm a pervert. Like the 250 pound demonic ferret himself who settles cases
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:30:01.480]  of we're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.040]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. A prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:11.740]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:16.900]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:22.440]  the most vital and important preparedness items at info wars shop.com. These are items

[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:58.000]  for joining us today. And we're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Three
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.580]  hours of hate speech, which is the Soviet term used for any political speech the globalist
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:10.960]  did not like. And we're going to be getting into hate speech here in a moment with Paul
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.880]  Joseph Watson. You heard in Germany they're banning homeschooling and arresting parents.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.080]  It's mainstream news. Just type in homeschooling parents arrested because the state says they
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  must raise your children. You've seen MSNBC say that your children belong to them.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.060]  And now they're saying government orders midwives to spy on racist parents. Spy program part
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:34.880]  of Orwellian plan to have children report on their mother and father. And the new state
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:40.040]  appointed parent, the parents are just there to pay for everything, teaches the child they're
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:47.680]  in charge of the parents. Just as the Bible says, they will set your children above you.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.480]  And this is the hell everyone wants. This is the hell everyone will get. They always
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.840]  abuse the children so bad once they get them, the kids always turn back to the parents.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:03.580]  But then it's too late. Too late, sucker. We've already wiped your mind with psychotropic
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:10.480]  drugs and injected you with enough vaccines to kill an elephant. Now you're gonna die.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.320]  The government loves you. I guess that's hate speech. See, the globalists are over the top
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:20.820]  with all their tyranny. And so I'm not supposed to go. It's over the top. Oh my gosh, pediatric
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:27.280]  cancer is up over 10,000%. Here's a Harvard study. Oh, look, hydrofluorolysis acid, another
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.680]  Harvard group of studies.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.540]  I just use those cuz everybody goes, ooh, Harvard. Actually studies that are even worse
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:40.260]  out of Britain and out of University of Texas. Oh, bone cancer, sevenfold increase. Brain
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:48.280]  cancer increase. Oh, it's extreme, shut down his hate speech. He's holding up Harvard studies,
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:54.280]  24 index studies about IQs dropped on average 17 points in women, 23 points in men.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:59.240]  So I say 20%, I average the two together. I mean, I shouldn't get upset about that.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:04.320]  You know what, I was a little hateful last week. I talked about Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:08.400]  who gets up on TV and brags and laughs at people that want fluoride out of the water.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.260]  We pay millions of dollars, over a million a year, to pay for toxic waste from chemical
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:19.160]  plants, what's left over, to be dumped in our water supply with hundreds of other chemicals
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.760]  with it, including radioactive isotopes.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.140]  And my calls for it caused a state investigation. Turned out Rick Perry was covering it up.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:30.440]  And it turned out they're putting upwards of five, usually three radioactive isotopes
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:36.480]  in the water. But hey, who cares about a case of kidney or bladder cancer? I mean, that's
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:43.660]  fun. It's fun to have that stuff chopped out, go on dialysis and then die early.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:49.600]  Why get people upset? Why point out it's wrong? I said the mayor's a piece of garbage, needs
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.680]  to be sued for laughing at scientists we bring into town. The heads of major university departments
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:01.600]  to tell them what's going on, like Dr. Conant. I should go thank you, Mayor, for laughing
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:10.120]  about something killing us. Thank you, you're better than me. I shouldn't call you a scumbag.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:16.400]  In fact, I don't wanna be hateful. Thank you, Facebook, for calling users dumb efforts.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.280]  Thank you, Facebook, for running a pump and dump, ripping off your idiot users, in your
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.720]  own words, who bought into it. We told you a year before it'd be a pump and dump from
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:32.720]  Bilderberg, 2012, no, 2011, in Switzerland, cuz Zuckerberg was there, along with Schmidt
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.720]  and others.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.800]  You know, I apologize for being right. I apologize for being red-blooded. I apologize for taking
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:43.800]  all this tyranny personal. I should just go out and act like a trendy. I could wear rainbow
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:53.720]  colored socks and grow a beard, and then just prance around like, around Austin. I mean,
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.520]  maybe I should do that. I apologize by being freaked out by what's going on.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:07.480]  By the way, speaking of Eric Schmidt, and speaking of all the things that are going
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.760]  on, and speaking of the New World Order and Bilderberg and Google, all the rest of it,
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:22.720]  document cam please for TV viewers. Here is the new Infowars magazine for the June issue.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.920]  And you've got a image of Bilderberg group meeting here with different world leader globalists
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.840]  around the table, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, with Schmidt with a silver
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.160]  platter with the world on it.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.880]  I think Molly Rogers, one of our incredible graphics people, came up with this image.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:43.920]  And boy, is that not a world class cover. And then it gets into some new original stories
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.240]  and also some of the most important articles we put out lately. 60 pages of color, glossy
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:55.440]  information warfare, and information on organic farming. And Obama is now head of, global
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.120]  head of Al-Qaeda with updated info on that story.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.820]  And the passing of Jim Tucker, an official eulogy there, Boston bombing suspect interrogated
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:09.000]  without counsel. But look at how that's a total police state. We look at a reasons why
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.080]  the Federal Reserve should be abolished, 11 reasons, amazing article on that front. Talk
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.180]  about something great to wake people up, this is it.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:25.320]  We get into the total surveillance grip, the panopticonic system of control. The crimes
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:32.920]  of Google, Google's sins go well beyond trouncing the competition and actively working to establish
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:39.360]  monopolies. It has collaborated with the granddaddy of evil, the CIA. Well, actually, it's above
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.360]  the CIA.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:45.240]  We have a big map here of the Bilderberg Group. Now it ties into the power structure. Just
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:50.720]  world class map put together by the crew over there. 2013 Bilderberg, June 6th, the 9th,
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.800]  Watford, England. They talk about something to wake people up. It's really a color book,

[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:22.680]  out there.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.560]  So you wanna wake people up, these issues just get better and better. Facebook censoring
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.520]  infoawards.com and the notices saying we're not allowed to show people involved in the
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:38.360]  drill at the Boston bombing. Liberals defend Obama for spying on media and those scandals
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.360]  are all covered.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:46.440]  It's all, will Rush Limbaugh be arrested and reeducated under New Florida initiative? Judge
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:53.680]  orders conspiracy reeducation for media figure, the latest photos on Bilderberg. It is all
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:59.720]  here in the new issue, the June issue of Info Wars magazine. It's a double cover. The back
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.480]  has like a regular newspaper cover with news about Bilderberg on it, Googleberg.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:13.480]  And about back in 2000, during a meeting about corporate values, Google employee Pat Bonnet
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.920]  came up with the catchphrase for the Internet Service Corporation don't be evil. But it
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.760]  goes on to the head of Google, Schmidt, saying that was stupid and there's no such thing
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.200]  as evil. That means they could do whatever they want to you while telling you what's
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200]  hate speech.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.400]  Your speech is evil, so they shut it down, but there is no evil. See, that means you're
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.640]  not allowed to have views, you're not allowed to have ideas. So infoawardstore.com. And

[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:31.000]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna run that out to the end of the Bilderberg the
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:38.660]  9th of this month. Okay, where to start here? So you've heard of hate speech, that means
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:43.920]  criticizing the government, posting photos of a Monsanto march, anything. If you're a
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.640]  Navy SEAL group criticizing Benghazi, you're not allowed to share that on Facebook. YouTube
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.320]  starting to block it.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.160]  They take over the web, they claim it's a public commons, and they're not allowed to
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.600]  do it, even though they own their own company, because it's false advertising. They just
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:05.520]  label your speech as hate. Everybody goes, well, what's the label? Nazis or hacking,
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:11.880]  and then it's not that. It's your kids at a Monsanto march. It's you criticizing Obama.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.840]  It's a pro-Second Amendment meme. You try to say you're pro-Second Amendment on Facebook,
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.040]  they'll delete or block your account. It is a reign of covert censorship, just like they're
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.960]  persecuting the Tea Party, the pro-lifers, the preachers, they want a chilling effect.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.960]  That's why they're persecuting mainstream media that tries to expose corruption. They
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:35.320]  want you scared to shut up, but it's backfiring, people are angry.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:38.680]  And let's look at Europe, let's look at England, let's look at the UK, that on average is about
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:45.240]  five years ahead of us when it comes to the Orwellian police state, the spy grid. We're
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.160]  ahead of them in some things here in the US, but usually in carbon taxes, you name it.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.880]  Europe and England, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, globalist controlled as well, they're
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.720]  about five years ahead of us. They are arresting hundreds of homeschooling parents. A lot of
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.000]  them are scientists, doctors, you name it, they homeschool their own children.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  In Germany, even if you have a teaching degree, they don't want you to train your kids. You've
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.440]  got to send them to the state. That's where modern education began, taking the kids away
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:15.640]  in Prussia, kindergarten, the brainwashing system, that military conscripts follow orders.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.880]  Worked well for Hitler 100 years later. So you've got all that going on.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.600]  And now, I saw this on the BBC like six, seven years ago. We had him on Robin Page, host
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.800]  of One Man and His Dog, a popular rural show where he would walk from town to town with
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.820]  a film crew and drink the beer, eat whatever the specialty was in the town and stay at
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:41.260]  old bed and breakfasts. He gave a speech where they were banning basically most hunting in
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.920]  England, fox hunting, you name it.
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.260]  And he said rural communities deserve the same rights. By the way, he's pretty much
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:50.520]  a liberal, but like a real liberal, Thomas Jefferson type liberal. He said rural communities
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:55.440]  deserve the same cultural rights as Muslims or homosexuals. They arrested Robin Page,
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:01.960]  we had him on. BBC for saying the word homosexual. That's like if you said Anglo arresting you
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.440]  saying that's racist. Science words are now hateful.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.080]  I heard a guy, I said this last week, I was at Martin Springs. It was a Spanish guy and
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:14.960]  two white guys swimming. They were playing water football, throwing a ball around. They're
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:19.760]  listening to him, laying there in the sun after I'd swam a couple miles. And I was like
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.960]  a mile that day, I think. And I'm sitting there, listening to him, my heart's thumping
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960]  away.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.620]  And I hear him go, let's go eat Chinese food over at, whatever the name of the place was.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:35.600]  And they go, dude, you can't say Chinese, that's racist. And then I saw people going,
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.120]  approvingly looking, going yes, laying around on the green grass with the other people were
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.120]  going.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:47.920]  I mean, people think that you can't even talking is like illegal, okay? And I remember seeing
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.240]  articles in the British news, you can pull this up where undercover police are to be
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.880]  put in cafes for racist speech and you'll be arrested. And if you say they're giving
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:00.320]  the foreigners all the jobs, they're paying their welfare, they're opening up the borders,
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:03.560]  they're voting away, you are arrested.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.400]  But then the charges are always dropped cuz the charges don't even really say that. It's
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.560]  all intimidation. And that's how they operate over there. So joining us, here's the article
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:19.100]  on infowars.com, government orders midwives to spy on racist parents, spy program part
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.840]  of Orwellian plan to have children report on their mother and father.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:27.200]  And then of course now, he reported a few days ago, that's by the way in their major
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.600]  papers, Watson's reporting on that. They're reporting that every parent, every group of
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.840]  parents will have a government parent that was with the child for 18 years, teaching
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.040]  them how to teach like Al Gore told kids a few years ago, it was recorded.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.920]  He said, go home and tell your parents the right way to be. You're their boss now. This
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:53.480]  is the essence of authoritarianism, the Hitler Youth, 1984. They come home and denounce you.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:58.440]  This is hellish. See, they can't win with their authoritarianism with the adults, but
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:04.160]  they're getting the kids. Paul Watson, devastating article, totally creepy.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.220]  And then again, the midwife, it says every week the government parent will take the child
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.680]  away for a meal. Let's talk about your parents. Are they smoking marijuana? Are they yelling
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.240]  at you cuz we're gonna, and the kid doesn't know they're gonna take the kid if the parents
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.240]  yell at them.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.880]  There's no law, but they don't care, they have eugenics courts. And again, it's usually
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:29.360]  a pedophile who's gonna be there. I mean, Seville, who brought kids to the royal family
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.160]  reportedly, he was a person that was allowed to take the kids from the parents. He liked
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:35.160]  to take care of them.
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:40.920]  He liked to have sex with dead bodies. Maybe Watson, they'll teach the kids how to have
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.480]  sex with dead bodies.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:51.460]  Well, Alex, under Ceausescu's Romanian dictatorship, 15% of all the informants were children informing
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:56.100]  on their parents. And apparently, Scotland is interested in using that template for their
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.120]  own system. Because you remember the story from last year about foster parents having
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.200]  three children taken away from them by the state because of their support for UKIP, which
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:12.000]  is a mainstream political party that just happens to oppose uncontrolled immigration
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.360]  into the United Kingdom.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.440]  As a result of that, had their three foster children taken away, they were perfectly good
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:23.720]  parents in every other regard. Well, this is that on steroids, and it's gonna be from
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:28.880]  birth. And it's already happening. They didn't even wait to pass it in parliament like the
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.280]  named state guardian that you were just talking about.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.360]  This is already in effect. It's called Getting It Right for Every Child. And it's a Scottish
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.700]  government program where these midwives for parents that are having newborn babies are
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:51.360]  ordered to spy on the parents, listen to their conversations, give them tests if they, quote,
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.240]  respect and value diversity, and if they give due prominence to their racial, ethnic, and
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.240]  cultural heritage.
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:05.240]  So they're basically trying to use political hate speech, racism as they deem it, to ferret
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:12.000]  out these extremist parents. And then if they raise alarm bells, if they raise a suspicion,
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.800]  they're then given another formal investigation. And if they're deemed to be culturally insensitive
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:25.640]  or racist, then the state takes the baby away. And this is already happening across Scotland,
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.440]  not even a vote on it. It's all well into the extreme.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.040]  No, no, I mean, this is the secret police who, again, are just gonna use the foreigners
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.080]  to break down the country and vote. And so the Scots are saying, I'm proud of being Scott,
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.520]  your kids are gone. And they're gonna be getting gang raped in a couple hours by the government,
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520]  literally, an army of pedophiles.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:50.400]  Scotland, of course, is famous for their CPS to be pedophile run, go ahead.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.320]  Well, and then there's a second part to it, which is gonna be put up for a vote in the
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:00.560]  Scottish Parliament, which is the children and young people bill. And that's gonna ensure
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.520]  that every intimate detail of a child is recorded, stored on a central database. And then as
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:12.420]  you said, a named state guardian is assigned to every single child, giving them access
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:15.120]  to the child, spying on the family.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.420]  And then they actually get the child to fill out a questionnaire, rating their parents
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:20.640]  from one to ten-
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:26.480]  No, this is already going on in public schools here. And they put it in government databases
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.040]  while everything's on computer now. This is the state in your family, in your life. You
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.880]  would put up with this from no one but the government.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.760]  Watson, I wanna cover this more. We have a short Leanne McAdoo report, where when you
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:46.040]  go to Walmart at your own risk, a guy married to a black lady has multiracial children.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:50.860]  So they called Homeland Security on them, and Homeland Security responded, of course.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:56.960]  So it's everybody. Anybody brown's a terrorist, anybody white's a terrorist. Everyone's evil
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:01.000]  but the government. The government are the only good guys.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.040]  Wouldn't it be nice to have one product that replaces more than ten, saving you space,
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.800]  time, and money? HEMPUSA.org has a complete full spectrum vitamin mineral detox formulation

[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:38.800]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.920]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:46.200]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.200]  army?

[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:21.520]  workers and the thought police seems familiar, it is. In Europe the EU has hired most of
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:25.520]  the bureaucrats from the old Soviet Union. I've had members of the EU parliament on naming
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:30.360]  them and they brought in all of Eastern Europe and the communists have been out of power
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:36.280]  for 15 years. They just put them all back in power in the EU bureaucracy. England, the
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:40.720]  UK is now under it. And we're going to keep watch until five after then our guest is coming
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:43.360]  in here dealing with censorship on Facebook.
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:50.120]  But they mean business and the creepiness of the state coming into your house like you're
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:54.480]  guilty like you've done something wrong. They started a pilot program of years ago and all
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:02.280]  of the UK where 30,000 new children a year, the 30,000 was the funding for it, have cameras
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:07.440]  put in the house the first month as if they aren't good to raise their kids. Everybody,
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.040]  they just randomly come and say a camera goes in your house, no judge, no jury, no warrant.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:18.360]  People comply with it out of fear. Now they're saying we're going to expand it to everybody.
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:23.320]  And by the way, your connector or your smart meter already does this so it'll watch for
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:29.200]  us. They're phasing it in and then finding reasons to break up your family. The state
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.560]  wants your kids.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:35.400]  Paul Watson, we're going to go to this Leanne McAdoo piece dealing with what's going on
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:40.000]  here with the Orwellian police state and the telescreens and the Walmarts. And then we're
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.880]  going to go back to you and get your take on how to fight this. Here it is. The piece.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:50.480]  Since 2010, Walmart has spearheaded a see something, say something campaign by broadcasting
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.840]  1984-esque messages from Homeland Security head Janet Napolitano that encourages Walmart
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:58.920]  shoppers to spy on each other.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:05.800]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:09.880]  Security begins with hometown security.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:15.700]  That's why I'm pleased that Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:21.700]  If you see something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store, say something immediately.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:26.320]  So it should be no surprise that police visited a father of three this weekend after he went
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:31.080]  to Walmart with his children to cash a check. Walmart security alerted authorities to a
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:36.360]  possible kidnapping of three young girls, all because the security guard thought it
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.100]  was strange that the girls weren't the same race as their white father.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.160]  Police who were at his home when he arrived made the oldest child confirm that the man
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:50.920]  with them was their father. But this is not new. In 2009, a couple lost custody of their
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:55.800]  children when Walmart photo center employees alerted police to pictures they thought were
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:01.540]  akin to child porn. The photos were of the couple's children taking baths and being wrapped
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:06.120]  in towels. That couple is now in the midst of a lawsuit with Walmart.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.380]  Back in 2010, when Big Sis became the head of the Walmartian Snoop Society, Alex Jones
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:16.960]  had plenty to say about the DHS's invasion into our lives under the threat of a terrorist
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.960]  attack.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:23.760]  Well, it's here, 1984 in America. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back. There
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.080]  is no doubt that we're in deep trouble as a society. The head of Homeland Security,
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.360]  Big Sis, Janet Napolitano, has now come out and announced that over 800 Walmarts in the
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:41.320]  next month are going to install telescreens at the checkout scanner with different federal
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:46.320]  orders to spy on the other people shopping.
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:51.640]  But don't worry. As we reported in 2011, if you're one of the many good citizens that
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:56.080]  are reporting suspicious activity, Homeland Security wants to shield you from facing the
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:02.340]  consequences of misidentifying innocent behavior as extremism or terrorism. Of course, this
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:08.480]  will only encourage an army of ill-equipped citizen spies to report any behavior whatsoever,
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:13.720]  no matter how benign. See something, say something. Unless, of course, you're blowing the whistle
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:18.600]  on government corruption, and then, you know, mum's the word.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.360]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and this has been an InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:26.720]  Well, she nailed that report. Yeah, and then she comes in and plugs the fact that you can
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.400]  go to infowars.com, forward slash show, see free audio and video feeds and the free podcast
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.440]  and the free iPhone Android apps. We're going to come back and get Paul Watson's take on
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:39.720]  this. I love that new term. Wall Martian Snoop Society.

[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:29.520]  All right, so when a Walmartian, that's a Walmart self-propelled stomach, calls the
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.200]  SWAT team on you because they say you're buying a firearm at Walmart. No, that's happened.
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:39.440]  You buy a gun and they call the police on you because you buy a gun. When someone falsely
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:43.600]  accuses you of something, now they're protected. You can't face your accuser, they won't get
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:48.260]  in trouble. And again, this is the essence of tyranny, the essence of evil.
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:53.520]  There's still a lot of common sense out there in law enforcement. That's why things haven't
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:58.080]  completely collapsed, but they're trying to train the police and the public to be good
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:03.960]  little Nazis, good little Soviets. Paul Watson joining us from the UK with Bilderberg coverage.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.980]  Regardless whether they let me in England or not, you're gonna be there covering Bilderberg
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:12.600]  2013. Infowars.com forward slash Bilderberg for all the live feeds, already a ton of stuff
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.600]  on that site.
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:18.080]  Please pass that out to everybody you know. To the listeners out there, because it's gonna
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:21.820]  have all the coverage, the photos, the live streams, you name it. You just saw and heard
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:30.000]  Leanne McAdoo's report speaking of Scotland. This is amazing to actually have the government
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.500]  embedded in every household. Everyone is guilty until their family's destroyed.
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:39.360]  It's not guilty until proven innocent of free speech. It's now guilty until we enslave you
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:44.760]  and destroy you because we are the weird control freaks that come by your house. I mean, this
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:51.320]  is just unbelievable. Will the UK, will Scotland stop this? Or is this the end?
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:56.460]  Well, they've already implemented some of it with the named guardian, the government
[02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:01.280]  social worker for every child. That's in a bill called the children and young people
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:05.660]  bill, which a lot of people are now starting to pay attention to, sign petitions against.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:08.240]  So if that's defeated, it could derail the rest of it.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:11.800]  I'm not having any pot-bellied pedophile in my house.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:15.800]  No, you just tell them to stick it. I mean, people have got to stop putting up with this
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.320]  crap. Also got breaking Bilderberg news though, if you wanna hold me over, which is pretty
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.320]  big.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:24.280]  Really, you have breaking? Start telling us, what is it?
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:30.280]  Well, we've got the maps that have been released by the police for the access, for the road
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:37.960]  closures, for the pedestrians prohibited around the entire site of the Grove Hotel. And just
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:43.440]  as we said weeks ago, they're concentrating all the protesters into that little pen at
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.740]  the front entrance of the hotel.
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:49.920]  The back entrance of the hotel is all gonna be blocked off. Nobody's gonna be able to
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:54.160]  get anywhere near it. Part of the road is completely blocked off. They're gonna have
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.920]  a police checkpoint. The rest of it-
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:00.040]  Yeah, that's where everybody's gonna be coming in. I told you, Paul. And guess how big the
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:02.640]  protest area is?
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:05.760]  Not very big at all, according to what I'm told.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.840]  Unbelievable. That's where they're gonna come in. The authorities said, we're gonna facilitate
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:15.080]  your right to free press and protest. You're not, because they're all gonna come in the
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.680]  back entrance. Nobody's gonna see any Bilderberg news.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.060]  Well, look, I told the head cop, I said, I'm not planning on leading the demonstrations
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:24.480]  or anything. But it sounds like we're gonna have to command the whole operation. Cuz I
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.960]  mean, I know everything's gonna happen.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.560]  We'll just go wherever we want, on the side of the road, wherever. It's supposedly a free
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:33.560]  country over there. And I told him, I said, I'm gonna go around the perimeter with a long
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:37.000]  lens and take photos of this non-existent meeting.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.320]  Well, they're closing it off under anti-terror guys, is when the real terrorists are inside.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:48.800]  But they've also, the council, in its idiocy, cuz 1,000, 2,000 people are gonna be descending
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:54.340]  on the scene anyway. They've rejected the planning applications to hold this festival
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:59.640]  in a nearby park. So now you've got thousands of people descending to hear Alex Jones and
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:04.960]  David Eich speak, and they've got nowhere to go. So this moronic council has created
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:08.000]  a bigger problem for itself by rejecting this application.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.840]  Well, cuz the mayor said it's terrorism to protest. She said it's bad to protest, and
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.000]  I'm so honored to have Bilderberg. I mean, how dare them? This is North Korea. We don't
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.360]  allow protesting in Watford.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:24.600]  Well, exactly. Now the residents who live in the area have got to show their passport
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:29.740]  just to get down their own street. And I mean, either we do it the easy way or the hard way.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:30.740]  The easy way is-
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:36.040]  So now the cops are not even gonna let us try to get down main roads on public streets?
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:40.960]  No, it's all blocked off or pedestrians prohibited. I'm looking at the maps right now.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.520]  But see, all we do is have the maps and get wherever they've backed it up. I mean, they're
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.080]  not gonna be able to block it all off. And they're just gonna show everybody how they're
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.480]  blocking free speech for this group of globalists. Stay there. I wanna recap all this. We got
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:05:00.800]  a guest coming in studio, but I'm sure, stay there.

[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:21.120]  oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:27.200]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.180]  of government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles

[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:06.040]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:11.140]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:16.520]  your liberty, freedom and security and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:22.060]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:26.900]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:32.160]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do-it-yourself
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:38.160]  public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided. This
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:42.660]  along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:48.840]  control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. eFoods Direct
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:55.720]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:30.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:38.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are into our number three and Andrea Malama, a mother who has
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:45.680]  been speaking out very prominently around the world about GMO and its links to autism.
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:50.260]  She was in the march, I believe it was in Houston against Monsanto trying to force their
[02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:54.280]  poison on us and she put her photos of her and her children up on her own Facebook and
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:57.920]  they suspended it and they blocked it. This is what they've been doing to people across
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:03.240]  the board. If you're anti-war, they do it. If you're Navy Seals criticizing Obama, they
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:07.600]  shut down your site. If we put up pro-Second Amendment stuff, Thomas Jefferson quotes,
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:11.920]  they suspend our site. This is what they do. That's all coming up here in just a moment
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.840]  cuz it ties into what is hate speech and Bill O'Reilly praising Facebook for shutting down
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:17.840]  free speech.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.680]  I mean, what a degenerate when it comes to the First Amendment. I mean, cuz I see it
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:25.880]  as degenerate to not support everybody's free speech, but they don't want a level playing
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:32.520]  field. Now, Paul Joseph Watson, one of our UK reporters and obviously the editor at prisonplanet.com,
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:39.520]  he has big breaking Bilderberg news. I've talked to the head cop involved. In my experience,
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:43.720]  these guys will say that they're your friend, that it's all gonna be great.
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:47.600]  They're gonna give you an area to demonstrate that everything will be fine. And then we
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:53.320]  read the local Watford paper with them saying the exact opposite. And the cop came up, he's
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:59.480]  very credible. But I mean, that's what they do in their job. And it's there to protect
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:04.260]  the Bilderberg group from the media, not for their safety.
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:10.140]  They've been indicted before for Lockheed Martin payoffs. I mean, this criminal stuff
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:15.040]  goes on there. They'll decide what power plants are gonna be allowed to stay open and what
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.340]  are gonna be able to operate. I mean, that's how real money's made is controlling the regulators
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:20.340]  to shut down your competition.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:24.520]  It's why the third world can never get going because they got fat cats there that don't
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:31.240]  let anybody operate but them, just like Ceausescu in Romania. And as the free market goes out
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:35.880]  the window to this monopoly fascism, using socialism on the grassroots, it's getting
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:37.120]  worse and worse.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:42.680]  So I'm saying at infoawards.com forward slash Bilderberg, whether they let me in the country
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:48.900]  or not, I'm getting on a plane, I'll be there Monday. Cuz they block all sorts coming into
[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:54.200]  England now. It's not a free country to a great extent. We will be at Bilderberg group
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:11:00.480]  with Watson, his brother, and other reporters of other names not announced that are going
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:01.480]  to be there, period.
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:07.240]  We already have a presence in England, period. We already have five people in England, period.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:12.460]  We're gonna be there and the police trying to block media saying that you can't have
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:18.440]  a permit to rent property. What a free country. You have to get a permit to have an event
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:24.000]  to rent property. I mean, England, when you're in England, I'll be interviewing people on
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.400]  the street and cops walk over and go, I'm pulling you in a database of extremists.
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:31.000]  You're not allowed to talk to people in England. And I go, but you got cameras watching us,
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.440]  I can't have this camera. Move along, you'll be arrested, yank. And you're like, wow, you're
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:41.400]  really free country. I mean, I've been in bad places in Mexico and the cops aren't as
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.560]  bad as they are in England now, but it's all real polite.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:47.880]  I'm just doing this, feel safe, Ken. Let me see your papers, they'll be arrested immediately,
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:53.800]  law. And it's because they're imploding the country, folks, and overrunning it with third
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:58.320]  world populations who were then put in the positions of power. This is the take down
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.160]  of where the Magna Carta came from.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:04.640]  There was a thousand years of wars trying to get some basic liberty in England. And
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.080]  then those ideas of the Magna Carta came here. And when Tony Blair got elected in 1996, 97,
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:15.080]  I'll never forget him in the BBC. He gave a speech when he said, it is my goal to remove
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:20.480]  the Magna Carta. And everyone was, it'd be like saying, it is my plan to destroy the
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.400]  Bill of Rights.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:30.160]  Just the arrogance, we will abolish, guys type in, I bet even 15, 16 years later, it's
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:38.880]  still up. BBC, Tony Blair, we will abolish Magna Carta. And imagine, I will abolish all
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:50.240]  your freedom. Yes, and now, you will get a permit to even be able to have a rally. Because
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:53.800]  your group said we want David Iaconellis Jones to come speak. And I said, okay, I'll go speak
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:54.800]  at your event.
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:58.840]  And I said, if they even let you have it, I've read your so called laws. They went,
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:04.880]  of course we're allowed to have an event. You think you will? What do you think you
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:10.040]  want, a free country? Excuse me, let's go to Paul Watson and then our guest. Paul, you've
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:17.740]  got an article coming out soon on Infowars.com with these maps, with these announcements.
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:21.660]  But I call for everybody. I call for everybody in England, even if they don't agree with
[02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:25.740]  us politically. I think it's great to have foreign bankers there, buying their politicians
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.200]  and all of this.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.660]  And in public, paying for these criminals to not have the media cover them. Everyone
[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:37.480]  in the UK needs to now go to Watford because the mayor's saying protesting is bad and protesting
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:41.040]  is criminal. I mean, my God, this woman needs to move to North Korea.
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:46.640]  Well, as far as I understand it, Alex, from talking to the organizers, people like Steve
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.440]  Lee, that police liaison officer, have been friendly and helpful. This is coming from
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.880]  the higher level police and the Watford Council. And the Watford Council just needs to stop
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:02.360]  being silly because you're gonna get thousands of people descending on an event with nowhere
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:03.360]  to go.
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.660]  Do they want us all to mass at the gates of the Grove Hotel, which is like 10 feet across?
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:13.200]  It's not gonna work. It's a public safety issue. And the fact that they've denied this
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:18.600]  application means that they're putting the public at risk. And as he said, this is taxpayer
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:23.840]  funded. This security operation with the police is taxpayer funded. So they've got a duty,
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:27.780]  a right, they owe it to the people who are going down there. They owe it to the residents
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:30.040]  who are now starting to complain.
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:34.560]  There's a resident's meeting on Monday night to grant this approval for this site, for
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.960]  this Bilderberg Festival. Because whether they do or not, everybody's gonna turn up.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:41.520]  You can guarantee it, and I don't think they realize that.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:48.400]  How dare you want to assemble? This is North Korea.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.760]  I reckon they think that it's just a few dozen hippies or something that are gonna turn up.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.600]  David Icke and Alex Jones on the same bill, that's never happened before. This is a reason
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.960]  for more people to go. If you were thinking about going, I mean, they should make the
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.960]  decision-
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:08.880]  Well, what'll happen is we'll go talk to farmers and people in the area. We'll have listeners
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.000]  there. We've already been emailed by farmers and people. We need to go through our emails
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  and get the folks.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.920]  And we'll just have a couple of alternate sites. We'll announce at infoawars.com, forward
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.080]  slash Bilderberg, and at The Real Alex Jones on Twitter, where the event will be. We'll
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:25.700]  have thousands of people show up for the speeches. And if they wanna arrest everybody, that'll
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:27.680]  be even bigger international news.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:33.440]  We're gonna call Kim Jong-un, they're in Watford's bluff on this, Watson. And if they try to
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:38.040]  stop me from coming into the country, it's even bigger. We only lose when we don't resist
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:39.640]  their tyranny, Watson.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:45.120]  Well, exactly. I mean, this mayor right from the start said, these protesters are gonna
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:50.040]  cause disturbance. They're gonna cause violence. She set their agenda right from the very start.
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:51.720]  That's completely unreasonable.
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:57.340]  This Watford Council needs to be reasonable, needs to accept reality that they've got thousands
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:02.340]  of people descending on their little town next week. And they need to grant the approval
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:06.800]  for this site. Otherwise, everybody's gonna be in a tiny pen at the front gates of the
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:08.180]  Grove Hotel.
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:12.020]  That's not gonna work. I mean, people are gonna get crushed. There's a main road there.
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:15.960]  People are gonna get run over. It's a massive public safety issue, and they haven't dealt
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.000]  with it. And they need to stop-
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:25.920]  But by the way, Stan Lee, not the famous billion dollar cartoon guy of Spider-Man fame, but
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:31.000]  the British Stan Lee, he sounds completely convincing that he's a nice guy on the phone
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.680]  and a listener. So he's an Academy Award-winning liar. But I've got his emails here, too, saying
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:40.520]  we're gonna have a large area, we're gonna support your free speech and the press.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:45.440]  But now the paper's saying that's not the case. So what's going on here?
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:51.460]  I think it was him that helped the organizers recommend the site of the park for the festival.
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:56.120]  So I think he's largely being helpful from the perception that I get. It's the council
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:01.040]  itself and the higher levels of the police that have cracked down on it. So we need Steve
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.040]  Lee to be-
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:04.680]  Well, I gotta be honest, Watson. I didn't wanna go. You and my wife and others said
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:11.480]  you gotta go. Jim Tucker just died. I'll have fun once I'm doing it, but it's not. I've
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:17.160]  been enough demonstrations. I've confronted globalists enough. I'm sick of it all. But
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:21.560]  I said, you watch, they're gonna act like total authoritarians and make this story for
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:23.000]  us and they're gonna do it.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.400]  That's the thing about these evil people is that they just think that they're gonna dominate
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:31.040]  us and that that's gonna intimidate us, Watson, and it's gonna be the opposite.
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:35.680]  Well, I mean, they should learn from their colleagues over in Switzerland who didn't
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:40.440]  close any roads off. They allowed us free access all around the hotel. There was no
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:45.360]  incident apart from their fake little bomb threat that they set up. Nobody was arrested
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:50.000]  as far as I know. And this security crackdown, anti-terror.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.240]  And the police helped light torches for everybody as well.
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:54.240]  Exactly.
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:59.200]  They were very helpful. The police wanted to, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:02.760]  We had a good relationship with the police in Switzerland. So if you wanna draw more
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:08.080]  attention to Bilderberg, fine, go ahead. Put up checkpoints, stop people from entering
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:12.920]  certain residential areas, stop people from putting events on in parks, and you'll only
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.720]  create a bigger story if that's how they wanna do it.
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:20.280]  But look at how the Swiss have done nothing but have liberty and they've got money pouring
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:24.800]  out their ears and their police hate the New World Order and were buying everybody drinks
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:28.960]  compared to groveling to the corrupt globalists and then they rob everything you've got.
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:35.180]  Yeah, and it's worth paying for it as well. We're paying for the checkpoints and the show
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:38.840]  your ID and the bag searches and everything.
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:44.360]  How long until you have an article of all these maps and stuff up at infoawars.com?
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:45.880]  Straight after I've eaten my dinner.
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:49.880]  All right, well done. I know it's late over there. Listen, get an article written. We're
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.760]  gonna post it at infoawars.com forward slash Bilderberg. And then Watson, regardless, we're
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:58.520]  gonna just go ahead and run this whole operation. People that wanna listen to our directives
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:02.640]  can. We'll say where to go. We'll say what to do. And whoever's with us is with us. And
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:06.800]  I may be sitting here in Austin, Texas. Let me get on that plane over there. But you'll
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:12.920]  be there regardless. And we will, I hope I get in. Either way we win. So great job, Watson.
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:14.320]  And we'll talk to you soon, buddy.
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:15.320]  All right, thanks, Alex.
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:18.880]  We're gonna go to break and come back with our guests for the balance of the hour. They
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:22.320]  flew in from Houston. We're very thankful for her doing that. Some of the other news
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:28.720]  up at infoawars.com. Matt Al's ratings hit new lows following attacks on Alex Jones.
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.800]  She had one of the biggest plunges in her history. She's sinking quickly. I don't know
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:37.220]  if that did it, but I have a singing suspicion it did. Adam Kokesh calls for decentralized
[02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:41.560]  open source march on state capitals. Yeah, the headline, guys, is he also said he's canceled
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:46.100]  the federal march. So that's the big headline. We need to change. I'm not griping, but as
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:50.520]  the editor I did say, as ghost editor, I said that's the headline I want. Government orders
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:57.200]  midwives to spy on racist parents. Tea party strikes back against IRS suing them. Entrapment,

[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:49.320]  a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:57.680]  our monetary system. Call for your copy. 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:04.200]  That's 800-686-2237. Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:09.240]  dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think.
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:12.680]  You probably hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:19.200]  is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:25.120]  increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:30.460]  sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:36.320]  But here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:41.660]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:47.320]  at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:53.480]  in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now at exposed123.com
[02:22:53.480 --> 02:23:01.520]  before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com. We all know that Berkey water purification

[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:18.440]  Andrea Malama is a mother who became a certified homeopath, analyst and independent researcher
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:23.240]  to help her own children. One formerly diagnosed with autism now recovered attending a regular
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:27.600]  school setting. And if you get on it early, folks, it's a cocktail. We'll talk to her
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.480]  about it, but I've had scientists, medical doctors on the pesticides, the GMO, the vaccines
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:36.800]  pushing over the edge, especially in boys because they say it's genetic. Well, yes,
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:40.760]  genetic boys can't handle as much adjuvant and mercury. They don't have as strong a blood
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:46.120]  brain barrier as women. Any medical doctor will tell you women are at least in their
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:50.560]  physiology are tougher than men. Women live longer. They can survive more bullet wounds,
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:57.440]  you name it. She created the website holisticapproachforautism.com to offer her professional services as a homeopath
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:04.200]  holistic consultant. Her expertise is autism. She also founded the reversing autism foundation
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.960]  and the parents group reversing autism to help parents all over the world. And her Facebook
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:15.400]  is also linked up on the site. And now they've suspended or blocked people who posted the
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:19.360]  Monsanto march. Hundreds of these came in. Mike Adams wrote a story that was on Drudge
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.400]  over the weekend. Dealing with that, we're going to put that on screen here in a moment
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:27.800]  and show the photo that was censored. And then later we'll get into what happened to
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:32.460]  your child and how you're able to reverse it by the grace of God. But what a cute photo.
[02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:38.600]  There it is that they gave you a notice of and blocked. Organic food, it's my medicine.
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:44.800]  Biopesticides equals autism. Say no to GMOs. I mean, that's evil. I mean, you think this
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:48.240]  is a free country that you're going to post? You march in Houston, you're going to put
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:53.880]  that on your Facebook? How dare you? I'm Mrs. Evil.
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:54.880]  Hi.
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:59.720]  You want to apologize to Facebook because Bill O'Reilly says this is good that you were
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:00.720]  censored.
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:10.880]  Hey, no. Hell no. I'm very upset that they blocked my children's pictures. They were
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:18.120]  protesting. Is that right? I believe in teaching the children by example. No, by just telling
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:19.120]  them.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.120]  How do we know they're not with Al-Qaeda?
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:21.120]  Oh, please.
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:26.760]  I'm being sarcastic. I mean, this shows how screwed up this country is. So tell folks
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:29.160]  what happened.
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:33.360]  I just explained to my children what happened to them. They were diagnosed with autism.
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.080]  Now they are fine and they perfectly understand anything you can explain to them. So I told
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:43.640]  them, I said, you guys were hurt by this biopesticide, by this food being contaminated, by these
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:50.520]  vaccines that has a lot of poison in it. And now that you guys are better, you gotta fight
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:51.520]  for your food.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:56.500]  Because for my kids, truly, organic food is medicine. Autistic kids, if they don't eat
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:59.120]  organic food, they don't make it.
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.080]  Explain what biopesticides are.
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:09.520]  Well, the difference between chemical pesticides is that those were like extracts from plants
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:16.600]  or other microbes. But it was like the byproduct of the production of plants.
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:21.880]  Sure, BP corn and stuff grows about 1,000 times stronger poison fungus than is actually
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:25.240]  in it, just as one example. And of course, it kills the bugs, but we're supposed to eat
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:26.240]  it.
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:33.720]  Well, the biopesticides is basically a genetic pollution. So it's 100 times more dangerous
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:41.520]  than just chemicals. Cuz with chemicals, your body can somehow methylate them, process them,
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:48.160]  and you can excrete them up to one point. But when you change your, with these biopesticides,
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:51.760]  the danger is that they are making epigenetic changes.
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:54.760]  That's right, well, there's been studies that show it's actually getting into the-
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:59.840]  I tell you that totally, the genetic studies, I attend every single-
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:05.080]  But I mean, if the BP kills the honey bees, why isn't it good for your children?
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.360]  Exactly, actually, the bees give me the answer because it was amazing. God works in serious
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:11.360]  ways. I have to say-
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:15.800]  Don't the bees deserve to die too? They might be with Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:20.960]  Definitely, they have to be because this is ridiculous. I mean, everybody's with Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:23.960]  Only the government and Monsanto are right. Everybody else is wrong.
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:24.960]  That's right.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:25.960]  Everybody else is wrong.
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:30.800]  Everybody wants their own. We have over 2.5 million children with autism.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:36.680]  That means 2.5 million families out there that are saying, please stop putting poison
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.160]  in our food. Please stop poisoning our children. And we are the cuckoos.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:41.160]  You are bad.
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:42.560]  We are the bad ones.
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  Good.
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.240]  And everybody else is okay, is correct. And we are the-
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:52.080]  You wanna thank Mark Zuckerberg for taking your photos down?
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:59.720]  Actually, yes. Thank you very much, Zuckerberg, because I'm here with Alex Jones, somebody
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.200]  that I've been admiring for the past 10 years of my life for saying the truth. So thank
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:12.280]  you, thank you, Facebook, for blocking my children's pictures. You guys, they bully
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:13.280]  the wrong mama.
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:14.280]  That's right.
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:15.280]  They have no idea.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:18.800]  You're not just gonna roll over and let them hurt other kids? How mean of you?
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:27.080]  Oh, yeah. They think they can just run over all of us, all the mothers. I mean, every
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:32.680]  time we try to protest about our children's health, we go to Washington with signs and
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:34.800]  we protest against the vaccines.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.720]  But Monsanto's got the money to put all their lawyers in as the regulators.
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:39.720]  Yes.
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:44.800]  Who will win, the mothers or the Monsanto eugenicists? We'll be back with our guest
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:50.440]  straight ahead with Zuckerberg's Facebook censorship.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:30:01.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:11.660]  I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I
[02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:21.120]  tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:27.900]  on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:35.860]  but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every
[02:33:35.860 --> 02:33:49.860]  natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:55.820]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:34:05.820]  it is? A virus. And Mr. Anderson, we're going to feed you pesticide, Mr. Anderson. We're
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:16.980]  going to soft kill you, Mr. Anderson. You understand that, Mr. Anderson? Resistance
[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:24.020]  to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:28.100]  Andrea LaLama is here with us. I want to hear about Facebook censoring you. Of course, you
[02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:31.860]  have the screenshots of it. We got hundreds of emails, people showing how it happened
[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:35.740]  to them. It's happened to us where they've suspended our account. They've terminated
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:39.820]  other people's accounts and we like sent out a Thomas Jefferson meme that if it gets picked
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:44.380]  up and it's big, it was a quote about, you know, how guns restrain evil everywhere and
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:48.340]  they just, oh, you can't have that. That makes too much sense. They want to use social networks
[02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:50.820]  at Bilderberg and everything to control us.
[02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:55.380]  They don't want us using it the other way around. But as Facebook censors, more and
[02:34:55.380 --> 02:35:00.340]  more people are leaving it. But, you know, I want to get into how you were able to reverse
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:06.460]  this in your child and the info you learn, because I've seen a lot of people detoxing,
[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:09.700]  getting an organic food. You know, it's an autoimmune response in the gut. There's a
[02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:13.740]  cocktail of things with the spectrum disorders. Obviously, you're more of an expert on it
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:18.900]  than I am because you've lived it. But I mean, I noticed the accounts they suspended were
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:21.060]  particularly of the march.
[02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:26.380]  They did not want people unified as humans together. They want us, you know, in our free
[02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:31.940]  speech zones or at home dying from cancer. So break down how they censored you and what's
[02:35:31.940 --> 02:35:34.220]  happened since then.
[02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:39.660]  Well, when I came back home from the march, I was very excited. I wanted to share these
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:48.100]  in my private page and in my public page. I have two Facebook pages. And the public
[02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:54.380]  page, when I posted there, I also shared with Natural News Facebook. And the moment I did
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:36:00.140]  that, Natural News liked the picture and they reposted. The moment they did that, I was
[02:36:00.140 --> 02:36:01.140]  blocked.
[02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:05.900]  Oh, that's good. Evil free association. I mean, you were sharing photos of a march.
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:06.900]  That's evil.
[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:13.260]  No, they didn't. They knew that Natural News has a bigger network, I guess.
[02:36:13.260 --> 02:36:15.900]  Thank God they were watching you. Thank God they were watching you.
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:20.980]  They didn't care much when I put it on mine, but they care a lot when I start sharing with
[02:36:20.980 --> 02:36:21.980]  you.
[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:25.580]  No, no, they have built in metrics when something's going viral. That's when they slap it down.
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:31.420]  Yeah, so they blocked me and I got really upset, but I wanted to have evidence of what
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:37.460]  was happening because it was so unfair that I recommend this to do all the people on Facebook.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:42.460]  If Facebook starts sending you these weird messages that you are blocked for no reason-
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:47.020]  Oh, they told Darren McBreen he couldn't use his for, I think it was three weeks, because
[02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:50.700]  he said something mildly political and they said, the way for you to get friends is not
[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:51.700]  be political.
[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:55.040]  And again, people say, well, it's their own site, let them do it. No, they advertise like
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:00.980]  it's free and open for free speech. It's false advertising. Facebook is a giant criminal
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:05.260]  operation. People ask, why are we on Facebook? Those are all fan pages people created. We're
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:08.100]  there to use their enemy operation against them.
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:12.740]  Exactly. I mean, the same thing people wrote me and says, just quit Facebook. Facebook
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:17.420]  is not public. I'm like, no, I want to use these against him themselves.
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:21.780]  Well, they buy up, Google has bought three ad companies we've used. And people say, well,
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:24.140]  don't use Google. They buy everything we use.
[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:27.060]  Exactly. And at this moment, we don't have a really good-
[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:31.700]  You made Facebook. It's supposed to be your info, you're sharing it. And then they go,
[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:36.100]  we're gonna tell you what you can put. And at first, it's like porn, killing, blah, blah.
[02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:40.940]  No, actually, sites saying kill tea partiers or stuff like that, that's okay. You're just
[02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:44.420]  not allowed to say, hey, Zuckerberg calls his dumb efforts.
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:50.920]  What really upset me, Alex, is that they are making claims that is completely false. They
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:57.380]  sent me this message saying that my pictures were abusive. That's sickening. I mean, it's
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:37:58.380]  my-
[02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:03.260]  Well, they always turn it around. You're abusive, showing your children at a march with signs.
[02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:05.140]  Let's put the thought crime on screen.
[02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:06.580]  This is what is wrong. I mean-
[02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:09.220]  You're bad. No, no, I agree. You're bad.
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:16.380]  Yeah, I'm bad, it's abusing. There it goes. And so what I did is I did a screenshot. And
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:20.580]  this is what I recommend people to do. Make screenshots because it's the only way you
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:21.580]  can prove-
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:26.500]  Show the shot of her kids again, folks. Show them the evil. Just imagine the abuse of that.
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:28.300]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:32.780]  Your children at a political march. I mean, they should be at home watching video games
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:33.780]  eating GMO.
[02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:34.780]  Yes.
[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:38.700]  You wanna apologize to Mark Zuckerberg for your-
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:40.740]  You need a state binder.
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:47.380]  Actually, the more they fight us back, the more we are gonna resist. And the more we
[02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:55.860]  resist, the better world we can have. I mean, I encourage the mothers to always continue
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:39:00.500]  to fight for their children, do what is right. And if Facebook is stopping us from letting
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:06.380]  the world know that our kids have been hurt by these pesticides and companies that are
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:10.980]  producing these poisons, they have to fight.
[02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:11.980]  They have to-
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:13.500]  We're gonna get into that, but have they reinstated your page?
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:20.620]  Actually, this is amazing. After 24 hours of you guys picking up my story, I think they
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:28.820]  were, sorry, my friends, they were pooping their pants in case some kids are-
[02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:30.580]  They were Janet Napolitano-ing their pants.
[02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:34.100]  They immediately turned me back on, and I start posting in another-
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:37.780]  We call that a Queen Elizabeth second. But seriously, they were Queen Elizabeth-ing the
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:43.060]  second thing. Now, expanding on that, don't just think Mike Adams and naturalnews.com
[02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:47.260]  or infowars.com, the mighty drudgereport.com picked it up.
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:49.140]  Yes, I hear that.
[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:51.620]  Isn't that good that he stands up for free speech?
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:54.180]  Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, let me tell you-
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:55.180]  He's kind of evil, too.
[02:39:55.180 --> 02:40:03.860]  Listen to you, Alex, and Mike, and read the Drudge Report for me is to be an oasis. I
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:09.900]  mean, oasis, it's so hard to find people here that can think.
[02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:11.100]  Evil oasis, yeah.
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:15.020]  I feel like I'm surrounded by zombies. It's horrible.
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:16.780]  You do seem like you're pretty alive.
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:17.780]  I am.
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:18.780]  I like that.
[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:22.260]  If you cut my arm, I got blood in my veins.
[02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:23.260]  Yeah.
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:25.620]  I bleed. But people here-
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:28.340]  Are you seething with life?
[02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:36.500]  Yeah. It's very frustrating. It's very frustrating, Alex. I talk to parents, and I try to make
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:40.780]  them aware of this, and they don't understand how important the food is. They have no-
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:44.260]  Their children are being assaulted. I've got eco science written by the White House Science
[02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:49.260]  Hour, and I've got Memorandum 200 by Kissinger. This is a plan. They brag. They're doing this.
[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:50.260]  Yeah.
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:55.580]  I mean, because we joke around, but you woke up, you said no. Tell us about your two children.
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:40:57.740]  We'll put them back up on screen. You don't have to say their names if you don't want
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:40:58.740]  to, but tell us.
[02:40:58.740 --> 02:40:59.740]  Yes, please.
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:03.100]  Was it your older boy that had the autism you were able to reverse?
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:14.300]  Yes. My older son was diagnosed with profound autism, but my second son, by the time I took
[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:20.260]  him for the evaluation, he was borderline, because I already started treatments on him.
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:25.440]  How did you figure out it was the bioweapon in the food and in other things?
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:31.560]  Because Godspeed. It was God all the way. I have never even heard the word autism before
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:39.580]  my kids were strike with it. I prayed really, really hard, and I said, Dear Lord, show me
[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:44.500]  the way. I don't need a miracle. I know it's gonna be hard. I'm gonna learn. It's gonna
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:49.780]  be tough. I'm willing to take it. Please forgive me for mistakes I have done. Help me, show
[02:41:49.780 --> 02:41:50.780]  me the way.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:56.800]  I can repair this. Just show me the way. And he did. And as soon as my son got diagnosed,
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.700]  I met this amazing mother. Her name is Dana Gorman. Thank you, Dana. I will forever be
[02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:02.700]  thankful to you if you are listening.
[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:05.340]  Did she tell you it was the GMO in the shots?
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:11.820]  No, she basically took me to the right people, and those people made me understand that my
[02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:18.180]  kids had a tremendous impairment detoxifying. And when you look that, if you Google that,
[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:21.920]  if you really do a good job finding that out, what can cause that? You will find out that
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:28.020]  there are biopesticides and mostly chemicals will die.
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:33.140]  Not only are the plants are designed to be able to have toxins sprayed on them and live,
[02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:38.540]  so that bioaccumulates. But then the big deal is a lot of them have their own natural pharmacological
[02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:41.500]  crop growing their own toxins, so bugs can't eat it.
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:42.500]  Exactly.
[02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:43.500]  But then it's supposedly safe for us.
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:50.060]  Well, what happened also is, thanks God, I have the ability to travel to, as you know-
[02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:52.100]  Yeah, other countries aren't having this autism.
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:54.100]  Exactly, so that's how I figure it out.
[02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:55.100]  America's cursed.
[02:42:55.100 --> 02:42:59.580]  That's how I even figure it out. People, you need to know this. I mean, if you go to Costa
[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:01.140]  Rica, people don't even know what it means.
[02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:04.780]  They don't have the breast cancer at 3,000% up. They don't have the autism.
[02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:06.340]  They don't have 10,000 autistic in there.
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:09.660]  Yeah, no, no. They don't have the plagues cuz they don't have Bill Gates.
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:10.660]  They don't have Monsanto.
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:14.220]  But Bill Gates is knocking on the door. He's on their board. He's coming though.
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:15.220]  Yeah.
[02:43:15.220 --> 02:43:16.220]  He wants in, he wants to help you.
[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:20.780]  The difference is that, over there, people are educated. They are fighting back. Even
[02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:21.780]  when the government-
[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:24.420]  No, no, no. They're extremists and bad. They don't love Bill Gates.
[02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:27.660]  They are truly, truly fighting back. I mean, it-
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:30.780]  Why don't they trust Bill Gates? He loves them.
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:32.140]  It's because they have-
[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:34.340]  Don't they want to die like ever, don't they want to be like us?
[02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:35.340]  Education makes a big difference.
[02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:36.940]  Don't they want to die like us?
[02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:43.900]  No, they don't. They don't. They actually, it's pretty pathetic because we've been there
[02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:47.620]  in that country with my husband, and sometimes we've said, people, come on with us to America.
[02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:53.540]  And they said, what for? I mean, they true, because when you have a educated population
[02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:58.740]  and they are content, they are happy, they don't need to be ultra mega billionaires.
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:01.340]  When you have a couple of millions, you can be happy.
[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:06.920]  Sure, people have been overrun in the third world, but they're even more awake because
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:10.580]  they've been screwed so much, they understand it. But I mean, specifically, what did you
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:13.020]  do then to reverse it in your son?
[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:18.940]  Well, by traveling, I started noticing there was a common denominator about the children
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:23.980]  with autism. And it kept pointing me to food, food, food, food. And I said, what is in the
[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:26.100]  food? And I found out it was these biopesticides.
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:28.500]  It's what the White House science are saying?
[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:35.700]  Yeah, actually, I was amazed that in 1991, when I was pregnant, I'm sorry, 2001, when
[02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:39.700]  I was pregnant with my son, I was eating Taco Bell. I didn't know better.
[02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:44.860]  Taco Bell loves you. And what happened is Monsanto at that time,
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:48.820]  they sold a Starlink corn that it was not for human consumption.
[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.740]  Yeah, no, they even admit that hurts you, but what's wrong with that?
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:56.380]  Well, it was in Taco Bell- What's wrong with Starlink? And it kills
[02:44:56.380 --> 02:45:00.900]  farm animals, why not eat it? Starlink admittedly kills people, why not die?
[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:05.180]  Well, you guess what they did? I can show you papers that instead of destroying, they
[02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:09.780]  gave it to the World Health Organization, and they went and they gave it to poor countries.
[02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:15.860]  Well, they want to help Africa. They gave it to Costa Rica, but Costa Rica
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:19.500]  has such an educated population, they actually started-
[02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:24.100]  Send it to Africa. No, they actually destroyed it.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:28.180]  Well, the Japanese are destroying it too. And they sue back United States for sending
[02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:31.300]  poison to the- Sure, well, Starlink itself, she's not just
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:35.420]  saying that Starlink, they admitted was even killing farm animals.
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:39.940]  Yeah, yeah, so that's what- But again, what's wrong with dying? I mean,
[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:45.300]  Bill Gates, there's too many of us, what's wrong with you? Just die, Bill Gates is better
[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.780]  than you. No, and another thing is the mainstream media
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:54.420]  is saying, we don't know what causes autism, we don't know, we don't know, but it's environmental,
[02:45:54.420 --> 02:46:00.220]  environmental. Okay, it's environmental. Hello, biopesticide is environmental.
[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:07.820]  Hey, hello, the US leads the world in every type of cancer, brain damage, lowering IQs,
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:09.700]  obesity, diabetes. Exactly.
[02:46:09.700 --> 02:46:15.580]  And then in the rats, GMO does that to them, and wow, two plus two equals four.
[02:46:15.580 --> 02:46:18.980]  Exactly. No wonder Scamburg doesn't want your info
[02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:19.980]  out. Exactly.
[02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:22.940]  Because let me tell you, Scamburg, he isn't eating any GMO.
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:23.940]  No. No.
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:29.500]  In my house, they are eating organic food. I mean, people can Google these articles.
[02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:34.740]  What's wrong, though? I mean, don't we want a 3,000, where are you originally from?
[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:37.900]  From Ecuador. Why doesn't Ecuador want a 3,000% increase
[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:42.740]  in breast cancer? Isn't that fun? Yeah, I mean, over there, actually the new
[02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:48.420]  constitution, the new president put in the constitution, no GMOs allowed in the country,
[02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:51.800]  in the constitution. And then Monsanto always gets caught sneaking
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:52.800]  them in. Yes, they are.
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:54.940]  Because they want to infect everything, because they're nice people.
[02:46:54.940 --> 02:47:01.860]  They're trying really hard. So it's pretty sad, because people are aware, and I believe,
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:07.020]  you see, I like to have a little bit more faith in Americans. I've seen people rallying
[02:47:07.020 --> 02:47:11.100]  with us. I mean, the rally was at least 500 to 1,000 people where I work.
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:16.180]  And they had like 400 plus rallies. It was no coverage. It was no support from
[02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:19.620]  the mainstream media. Cuz they're all told not to. Let me tell
[02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:23.900]  you something. But here's how much it changed. He died last year, great guy, Darry Brownfield,
[02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:29.160]  icon in broadcasting, 400 and something affiliates. He would criticize Monsanto, even though he's
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:34.580]  a major landowner, rich guy, sold Learfield Communications for a ton of money.
[02:47:34.580 --> 02:47:38.820]  He was doing that radio show because he wanted to, he was a rich guy. Made his own money
[02:47:38.820 --> 02:47:45.340]  as a rancher up in Missouri. More Texan than a Texan, he's a great guy.
[02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:52.100]  And he had a partner in his company. And a lot of this is off record, but he's been dead
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:55.820]  now for a year, and I'm just gonna say this. I mean, part of it came out. They were told,
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:59.420]  listen, you can keep your 400 affiliates. You can keep all this money you're making.
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:03.820]  Stop talking about Monsanto just mildly. And he said, I'm not. Sold off his piece, started
[02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:07.240]  his own deal to tell the truth, and didn't make a big deal out of it.
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:12.540]  But that's what the kind of stuff Monsanto does. Now, five years ago, they did that.
[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:16.300]  The issue is, is that now everybody's speaking out against them. They used to really try
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:19.720]  to stop people. They can't stop everybody. And let me tell you, these reporters that
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:23.380]  follow orders not to cover it, you're gonna have your kid in a year or two.
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:27.380]  And when they're brain damaged, you're gonna get them off GMO. You're gonna become a listener.
[02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:31.940]  You're gonna know we told you the truth. Or maybe you won't fully reverse it. I'm sad.
[02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:37.780]  You won't fully reverse it from taking the shots and the GMO. But you'll reverse part
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:41.940]  of it, and you'll see me on the street and cry. This happens all the time. And say, I
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:45.920]  got fired after I tried to report, but at least my child can now talk.
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:49.580]  And you'll grab me and start crying on the side of the street. See, I wish you'd listened
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:54.020]  before you cry. Because let me tell you, this is all real. Go ahead.
[02:48:54.020 --> 02:49:00.820]  Exactly. I mean, I'm tired of hearing the parents over these past ten years. Let's create
[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:05.420]  autism awareness, autism awareness. I'm like, we need to create awareness how to prevent
[02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:06.420]  autism.
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:12.200]  Same deal. It's always find a cure for breast cancer, cut your breast off, not, why is it
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:13.200]  exploding?
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:16.260]  It doesn't make any sense. I mean, what's wrong with people?
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:20.260]  It's like, everywhere I go, we just have to give money for prostate cancer or breast cancer.
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:26.100]  I'm like, well, actually, I actually do give money to groups that are exposing the GMO.
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:31.140]  But I mean, it's incredible. The groups all make money off killing the women.
[02:49:31.140 --> 02:49:42.740]  No, and every time that there is this epidemic diseases like autism, instead of making groups,
[02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:51.380]  big foundations as making awareness of how to prevent that happen. Why they keep doing
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:58.580]  like, let's make cancer awareness, autism awareness, diabetes awareness. I mean, what's
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:03.700]  up with the awareness of making people know that people are sick?
[02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:07.140]  The awareness should be how to prevent. Let's make awareness-
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:12.220]  How dare you reverse this with your sons? How dare you go out of the world trying to
[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:16.940]  warn people? How dare you? You're a nice looking lady. You should be out of a swimming pool
[02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:21.620]  posing right now and having fun and being decadent, not caring. You could probably have
[02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:26.180]  institutionalized your son. Hell, the Center for the Bioethics Journal says you should
[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:29.580]  just now just kill your son if he was autistic.
[02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:33.620]  Why don't you try to legalize post birth abortion? You could just kill your sons. And once the
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:37.100]  government legalizes it, that would be the trendy thing to do.
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:40.060]  That would give Bill Gates more money and let him run things.
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:45.380]  My neurologist says- You're an extremist. You should lobby to have, like Dr. Peter Singer
[02:50:45.380 --> 02:50:49.940]  is calling for, to kill, to have the government kill autistic children.
[02:50:49.940 --> 02:50:51.260]  That's what they want. That's what they hope for.
[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:53.540]  Oh no, that's the plan. They're going to be filming and that's what they're going to do.
[02:50:53.540 --> 02:51:00.940]  But I mean, how dare you? We need death. Thank you, Bill Gates. Murder me. Murder me, Bill.
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:06.260]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:11.100]  severe hot flashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard to work
[02:51:11.100 --> 02:51:16.820]  because it continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:21.260]  After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally
[02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:25.760]  again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product.
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:29.660]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10%
[02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:35.160]  of its protein content as glutathione. But due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:39.500]  glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you
[02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:43.900]  restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:48.420]  then as a result, your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement

[02:52:06.540 --> 02:52:11.640]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:17.020]  your liberty, freedom, and security, and that's food. We thought the danger was drought, or
[02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:22.540]  food diverted to our gas tanks, or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:27.380]  to afford it, or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[02:52:27.380 --> 02:52:32.660]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do-it-yourself

[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:09.100]  Edition of the magazine is in. My wife called up, and we do that fun banter, everybody's
[02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:13.720]  laughing out there. She goes, let that lady talk. And my wife never does that, but I do
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:17.720]  get a little bit obnoxious sometimes. But hey, don't argue with success, folks. Now
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:20.620]  you listen to the show, it's all right. But seriously, we're going to do some overdrive
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:25.000]  because I want you to really get into, but right now before some stations leave us, give
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:30.540]  out your websites, Facebook, all that stuff. And talk about briefly how you reversed it.
[02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:34.020]  You went and studied that other countries don't have this. You found out what happened.
[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:37.140]  How fast did it reverse it in your sons?
[02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:43.780]  It took me at least five years to reach the point that my son can actually talk back to
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:50.060]  me in sentences on his own. It took me five years because I was applying everything I
[02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:57.220]  was learning as it goes. So when my second son develop autism, it was faster for me because
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:56:02.940]  I already knew what to do. So actually, I was able to help another mother that has triplets
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:07.020]  with autism, three girls with autism.
[02:56:07.020 --> 02:56:12.140]  And I thought it was going to be a very difficult task because the girls are seven years old
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:17.020]  when they came to ask me how I did it and how she can do it. So I taught the mother
[02:56:17.020 --> 02:56:21.660]  how to do it. That's my job. That's what I do is I teach people because that's the only
[02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:29.940]  thing the law allows me to do. I can share my information legally. So I taught her how
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:32.720]  to do it and she did it and that was amazing.
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:38.900]  And she was able to reverse the autism in two of her triplets in like a year and a half.
[02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:43.780]  And they were substantially recovered so they can go back to school and attend regular setting.
[02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:51.900]  And the third one, it had a slower pace, I'm sorry, but she continued to recover. You see,
[02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:58.780]  the recovery rate on each kid is different because it depends on how much damage has
[02:56:58.780 --> 02:57:03.980]  been caused by the biopesticides, how many epigenetic changes those children have. You
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:11.820]  see, autism, it's an intracellular damage. And it's not impossible to reverse that, but
[02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:13.460]  it takes a lot of effort.
[02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:17.380]  And we shouldn't have to go through all the trouble to avoid this. It should be illegal
[02:57:17.380 --> 02:57:21.660]  everywhere. We're not crossing some plants or something. They're growing pesticide in
[02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:22.660]  them.
[02:57:22.660 --> 02:57:27.860]  Well, Alex, if you're Christian, like many people are, and you understand that God wrote
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:33.260]  in the Bible that he doesn't want us to destroy his creation.
[02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:34.260]  Don't mix the seed.
[02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:38.500]  Don't mix the seed. It's written in the Bible. I think this is the original sin. It's the
[02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:42.780]  worst possible thing that humans can do is crossing a species. These are natural laws
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:50.460]  that God established. We should respect this. Okay, a stop of offending God. A stop is enough.
[02:57:50.460 --> 02:57:53.580]  But Monsanto thinks it's God and look at the abominations it's building.
[02:57:53.580 --> 02:58:01.860]  Well, let's be fair. It's not just Monsanto. It's Sangenta, it's DuPont, it's down. I mean,
[02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:07.540]  I know I promised my husband not to mention names but we gotta talk. I mean, this is enough.
[02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:12.860]  Our kids are being killed. I don't see the difference from having a child with a profoundly
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:16.140]  autistic and a child that you lose that it dies.
[02:58:16.140 --> 02:58:20.720]  Well, I mean, the studies are there that with a lot of these GMOs, it's hurting the roads.
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:24.980]  And then we know our numbers are exploding. It's vaccines. It's a lot of stuff. And absolutely,
[02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:28.980]  it's time to go all the way against these people. And if they want to fight, they're
[02:58:28.980 --> 02:58:34.020]  going to get one because they are assaulting us. They gave us age in orange. What is their
[02:58:34.020 --> 02:58:38.340]  next? They're gonna tell us that's good. We'll be right back overdrive info wars.com forward

[02:58:52.060 --> 02:58:56.500]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[02:58:56.500 --> 02:59:01.620]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[02:59:01.620 --> 02:59:07.020]  your liberty, freedom and security. And that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:12.540]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:17.380]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[02:59:17.380 --> 02:59:22.160]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation, the do it
[02:59:22.160 --> 02:59:28.480]  yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided.
[02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:33.140]  This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[02:59:33.140 --> 02:59:39.320]  control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. E foods direct

[03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:26.900]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Andrea LaLama is our guest and she's here to be interviewed
[03:00:26.900 --> 03:00:34.020]  tonight by Mike Adams is hosting in full wars, nightly news. Define showtimes info streams,
[03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:37.820]  all of that at prison planet.tv. Coming up the next segment, I forgot she's the lady
[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:42.880]  that went and got tests done the epigenetics. Monsanto came in with threats. I mean, this
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:48.180]  is just amazing. And like she said, you know, Monsanto is not the only group it is. Monsanto
[03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:53.940]  is just now kind of like saying search engines or Google. It's kind of the term you use just
[03:00:53.940 --> 03:01:00.300]  to describe genetic engineering. But But getting more into traveling around the world, what
[03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:06.300]  will people find on your website, holistic approach for autism.com? Well, in the website,
[03:01:06.300 --> 03:01:12.140]  I describe my experience with my children, how they develop autism, how they recovered.
[03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:18.980]  I also put a lot of my hypotheses, a lot of my research is there. People can find out
[03:01:18.980 --> 03:01:26.020]  how I discovered to help my son with natural herbs and extracts and things that truly,
[03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:30.460]  truly work and they won't harm the children because when my son got diagnosed, the first
[03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:36.420]  thing I was offered by my neurologist was Ritalin, concerta. I mean, and you name it,
[03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:39.100]  just pharmaceutical drugs to dub my son because they-
[03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:42.380]  That makes the brain shrink, the heart expand. Exactly.
[03:01:42.380 --> 03:01:48.260]  Lowers IQ, what's wrong with that? I asked them, I said, is this stuff gonna cure him?
[03:01:48.260 --> 03:01:54.740]  And they said, no, but he's gonna be manageable. I'm like, I don't wanna manage him. I wanna
[03:01:54.740 --> 03:01:59.620]  cure him. He was born that way. I have footage, video that can prove it to you that my son
[03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:05.860]  was developing normally until he got these five shots at once that trigger his autism.
[03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:11.220]  Because you see, once you have epigenetic changes by this poison, by this pesticides
[03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:18.060]  in your food, then all you need is these triggers like vaccines that are more poison that your
[03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:21.560]  body can't defend from it anymore.
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:26.940]  You can create antibodies, you can detoxify from the mercury, all these pathways that
[03:02:26.940 --> 03:02:32.860]  we have inside are broken and that's why our kids are developing autism. And that is being
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:40.780]  proven with genetic testing. So I was trying to prove this at that time hypothesis based
[03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:45.940]  on research, of course, but hypothesis because I have not been able to take my son to a lab
[03:02:45.940 --> 03:02:51.500]  and getting tested and prove the world and say, hey, here it is, you see, I show you.
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:57.100]  So what happened is I contact three different laboratories and I tried to do that. Trust
[03:02:57.100 --> 03:03:00.900]  me, I fought so hard to prove people that our kids are being hurt by this.
[03:03:00.900 --> 03:03:03.780]  But they'd already been called, you don't test these kids.
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:04.780]  Exactly.
[03:03:04.780 --> 03:03:05.780]  Cuz we love you.
[03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:06.780]  Exactly, I mean-
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:10.780]  We're gonna tell the story when we come back from break, but I'll give people an idea of
[03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:12.780]  what happened.
[03:03:12.780 --> 03:03:18.660]  Well, they are freak out. That's basically the point. I mean, laboratories are intimidated,
[03:03:18.660 --> 03:03:25.900]  but who knows who, that we cannot even test our children's stools or blood to find if
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:29.080]  they have betetoxin or pesticides in their system.
[03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:31.940]  Because that's patented, just like the breast cancer gene.
[03:03:31.940 --> 03:03:32.940]  Exactly.
[03:03:32.940 --> 03:03:33.940]  That's-
[03:03:33.940 --> 03:03:36.060]  Exactly, so you cannot touch it, you cannot investigate this stuff.
[03:03:36.060 --> 03:03:37.580]  But that's bull. I mean, they can say-
[03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:38.580]  I mean, they gave you the poison.
[03:03:38.580 --> 03:03:41.980]  Well, it was kinda like their crops infect other crops. You prove you bought your seeds,
[03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:46.340]  they infected you, but the court rules against you. Now you wanna show that it's in your
[03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:51.300]  child's bloodstream, these chemicals and things. And they say, that's our chemical, you can't
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:55.620]  test for it. I mean, that's total violation of common law. That's pure bull.
[03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:56.620]  Exactly.
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:03:59.500]  Like if somebody patented cyanide and then you were poisoned with it, you can't test
[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:00.500]  for cyanide now.
[03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:05.380]  And when you go to other foreign countries to do these tests, like I was thinking to
[03:04:05.380 --> 03:04:12.540]  do, then it's completely denied here in United States. As soon as I will, if I do something
[03:04:12.540 --> 03:04:16.860]  like that, they will start discrediting because it's not officially made in United States.
[03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:21.460]  But tell people what the one test you did get done did. I can't mention the name of
[03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:25.100]  the group when we come back. But ladies and gentlemen, the system is, I stood up here
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:29.180]  and joke about this cuz it actually hurts me, it's gallows humor. There's no doubt we're
[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:33.300]  under a plague. There's no doubt we've had 53 million abortions. There's no doubt we've
[03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:36.920]  gone from one in 25,000 with autism to one in 50 something.
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:40.900]  There's no doubt cancer rates are all exploding. There's no doubt diabetes is exploding. There's
[03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:45.200]  no doubt that whatever's going on, whether it's on purpose or not, is hurting us. And
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:51.700]  we know it's on purpose, the globalists are eugenicists. They're obsessed. These big GMO
[03:04:51.700 --> 03:04:55.820]  companies on record don't serve their own stuff in their own cafeterias. Their scientists
[03:04:55.820 --> 03:04:59.620]  won't eat it cuz they're eugenicists, ladies and gentlemen. They know full well what they're
[03:04:59.620 --> 03:05:01.420]  doing.

[03:08:22.020 --> 03:08:27.940]  a mother who heads up Holistic Approach for Autism.com. You know, she's one of the, I'd
[03:08:27.940 --> 03:08:34.860]  say, top 10 people out there, mothers, really leading the fight, exposing that there's hydrofluorosolicic
[03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:40.820]  acid in the water. There's GMO in the food that grows its own pesticides. Now, there's
[03:08:40.820 --> 03:08:45.620]  major studies that have come out just recently saying it is epigenetic. It is getting into
[03:08:45.620 --> 03:08:50.900]  the DNA. It is leaking out of the gut. No kidding. I mean, I saw an article in the Washington
[03:08:50.900 --> 03:08:55.340]  Post last year. I covered probably five times on air. It had a headline where farmers are
[03:08:55.340 --> 03:09:03.380]  violating GMO planting rules and not planting a refuge for the bees and insects so that
[03:09:03.380 --> 03:09:10.860]  they'll have something to eat, not all die. I mean, they spray sodium fluoride on the
[03:09:10.860 --> 03:09:16.740]  crops to kill the bugs. It bioaccumulates, so it's a cocktail. So the vaccines go over
[03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:19.780]  the top and then you add all this other stuff into it.
[03:09:19.780 --> 03:09:26.500]  It is a cocktail and they know this is going on. The globalist, they avoid it. Let's turn
[03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:31.380]  her mic on. So in this segment, I'm gonna give you the floor, break down what you discovered,
[03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:37.020]  the mercury, how it all ties together, what's going on, the labs you went to to get it tested
[03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:40.020]  and what Monsanto did. Break it down.
[03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:47.340]  Well basically, our Almighty helped me by letting me see the bees dying in my backyard.
[03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:52.500]  Suddenly I had hundreds and hundreds of bees coming and dying in my backyard. And I was
[03:09:52.500 --> 03:09:57.760]  like, what is going on? So I started researching about the bees and I discovered they have
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:04.040]  these neurotransmitters called octopamine. And I thought, what if the humans also have
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:09.340]  these octopamine and our children has it and they are being affected by this.
[03:10:09.340 --> 03:10:14.300]  So I contacted a couple of scientists, friends of mine, and they said, Andrea, I never heard
[03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:20.580]  about it, I never knew about it. And I tried, I went to UCLA Medical Center.
[03:10:20.580 --> 03:10:22.820]  They're just trying to put it on screen and I was trying to get them to shrink it.
[03:10:22.820 --> 03:10:28.860]  There it is, people can go to, they can just type reversing autism, one word all together,
[03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:33.540]  and it will send them to my page, which is Holistic Approach for Autism.
[03:10:33.540 --> 03:10:34.540]  Keep going, keep going.
[03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:39.580]  And they can read there that octopamine is an neurotransmitter that is actually the main
[03:10:39.580 --> 03:10:46.100]  neurotransmitter the bees use for communication. The bees weren't dying, the CCD, the Colony
[03:10:46.100 --> 03:10:51.220]  Collapse Disorder, basically is that the bees go foraging and they never come back home.
[03:10:51.220 --> 03:10:53.460]  And that's how I see autism, our kids.
[03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:57.180]  And I was reading, you developed this theory even before the German University did. And
[03:10:57.180 --> 03:11:02.140]  they've now found in several studies that indeed, certain types of BT corn are directly
[03:11:02.140 --> 03:11:04.980]  linked to the bees just not knowing where they are.
[03:11:04.980 --> 03:11:09.460]  Exactly, the bees don't, it's autism. I'm sorry, but the bees are getting autistic.
[03:11:09.460 --> 03:11:10.460]  No, sure.
[03:11:10.460 --> 03:11:17.260]  It's the same pattern. So that's why I believe God was in my side because when I started
[03:11:17.260 --> 03:11:25.100]  studying the bees, I kept an open mind. I was not trying to make my hypothesis to fit
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:29.780]  and find something to corroborate what I was thinking. I totally went with a brain totally
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:35.580]  blank and not thinking about what I'm going to find, just research, research, and research.
[03:11:35.580 --> 03:11:43.020]  And I find out that the biopesticides needed to fool the bees to eat the biopesticides
[03:11:43.020 --> 03:11:47.860]  because the bees are so smart that a few got sick, they went back to the colony and says,
[03:11:47.860 --> 03:11:50.700]  don't go there, that field is full of poison.
[03:11:50.700 --> 03:11:51.700]  But also-
[03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:52.940]  They're smarter than us.
[03:11:52.940 --> 03:11:57.220]  Absolutely. And what happened is not just the bees were doing that, but other-
[03:11:57.220 --> 03:11:59.140]  Farm animals won't eat GMO.
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:06.700]  Other insects were doing the same thing. So what these corporations that are doing biopesticides
[03:12:06.700 --> 03:12:13.700]  are doing is they create these mercury fungicides and mercury pesticides to make them kind of
[03:12:13.700 --> 03:12:19.580]  like drunk. So when the insects fly to the field, they get first drunk and then they
[03:12:19.580 --> 03:12:21.440]  get the biopesticide.
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:25.500]  So that's what the fluoride does to us. It makes us drunk and then they kill us so we
[03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:30.220]  don't notice. Very loving. No, they're killing us the same way. Very loving.
[03:12:30.220 --> 03:12:33.580]  Yeah, the correlation of what they are doing to the insects to what they are doing to our
[03:12:33.580 --> 03:12:38.340]  children, it's horrible. It's exactly the same thing. So what happened is that once
[03:12:38.340 --> 03:12:43.500]  the bees get all these mercury and then they get intoxicated by acetrin as one of the ones
[03:12:43.500 --> 03:12:49.660]  they use, they can read the whole in detail with the chemical names and what I found with
[03:12:49.660 --> 03:12:51.160]  references and everything.
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:56.320]  And then they lose this octopamine, which is the main minute for communication. So when
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:13:00.300]  they come back to their home, they feel that they make it, they can communicate to the
[03:13:00.300 --> 03:13:02.700]  other bees that something is happening.
[03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:08.380]  Just like YouTube now breaks us into subgroups so we can't communicate. It's dumb us down,
[03:13:08.380 --> 03:13:12.940]  lock us down, starts hardcore soft killing. Don't let us communicate, yeah.
[03:13:12.940 --> 03:13:17.420]  You see, when you have a normal child like me, Alex, and you see this child out of the
[03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:21.660]  blue start losing its words, the words that he was speaking before. You know what it is
[03:13:21.660 --> 03:13:25.500]  for me not to hear my son calling me mom ever again?
[03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:31.060]  He couldn't even say mom, okay? He lost it, he lost it. He couldn't ask for food. He was
[03:13:31.060 --> 03:13:35.780]  starving, and he couldn't say, I'm hungry. And then when-
[03:13:35.780 --> 03:13:39.260]  Well, Andrea, there's too many people, we gotta do something.
[03:13:39.260 --> 03:13:42.620]  That's what I'm here, that's what I'm here for, and I really appreciate you supporting
[03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:43.620]  us.
[03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:47.180]  But I'm playing the part of Bill Gates, there's too many people. We've got to get rid of your
[03:13:47.180 --> 03:13:49.860]  children. And my answer is, how about he gets-
[03:13:49.860 --> 03:13:50.860]  Die.
[03:13:50.860 --> 03:13:53.220]  Yeah, well, how about Bill Gates gets off the planet?
[03:13:53.220 --> 03:13:58.860]  Exactly, die. With all the money he has, he can make his own little rocket and send himself
[03:13:58.860 --> 03:13:59.860]  to live in Mars.
[03:13:59.860 --> 03:14:05.540]  That's a good idea, actually. Like the Phantom Zone, General Zod. Okay, keep going.
[03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:08.900]  All these elites should do that. Just go with the elites over all.
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:10.300]  I think they're actually planning that.
[03:14:10.300 --> 03:14:11.300]  They live.
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:12.300]  Elysium, yeah.
[03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:15.780]  Leave it alone. This world would be so much happier if they just take a rocket and go
[03:14:15.780 --> 03:14:19.540]  to the freaking moon. I bet you the moon is gonna spit them out. I mean, it's-
[03:14:19.540 --> 03:14:22.980]  Well, the real proof is they've all written books bragging they would do this 30, 40 years
[03:14:22.980 --> 03:14:27.700]  ago. Now they're doing it. They're here, and everywhere they're in control this is happening.
[03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:29.340]  Where they're not in control, it's not happening.
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:34.860]  I mean, Amish, who won't do this, no autism. People eating the GMO, taking the shots, total
[03:14:34.860 --> 03:14:35.860]  autism.
[03:14:35.860 --> 03:14:36.860]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:40.380]  Well, keep going with what you found. Tell us about the people you try to get tested.
[03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:47.500]  Well, what happened is after I find out all these answers for my child, I start putting
[03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:53.860]  on the internet. I create this Yahoo group, a hell group, reversing autism. And the mothers
[03:14:53.860 --> 03:14:57.220]  there says, please, Andrea, what do we do? And I start sharing. And I said, listen, we
[03:14:57.220 --> 03:15:01.340]  need to prove that our kids has this. Help me out. There's a lab that is willing to test
[03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:02.340]  our kids.
[03:15:02.340 --> 03:15:06.260]  So I said, all right, we wait for them to call us back. Two weeks went by, they didn't
[03:15:06.260 --> 03:15:11.220]  call me back. So I put the mothers, come on, moms, you rock, help me here. Call, this is
[03:15:11.220 --> 03:15:16.580]  the number. Fill the answer machine, make them call us back and explain to us why they
[03:15:16.580 --> 03:15:20.460]  are not testing our kids. They agree to do it.
[03:15:20.460 --> 03:15:24.820]  So the mothers rock. You see, mothers with autistic kids will do anything-
[03:15:24.820 --> 03:15:28.020]  They're battling back against the General Zod. So what happened next?
[03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:31.980]  Well, the laboratory called me back and off the record, that's why I'm not mentioning
[03:15:31.980 --> 03:15:37.620]  their name. Off the record, they say, Andrea, Monsanto said that this belongs to them. It's
[03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:41.580]  their patents. We cannot test your son for these proteins in himself. We could get an
[03:15:41.580 --> 03:15:42.580]  illegal bottle.
[03:15:42.580 --> 03:15:45.780]  So they put it in the food. They know in studies that people have done the test. Now people
[03:15:45.780 --> 03:15:50.740]  have done the studies. It's leaking out and they say, you can't test for our poison in
[03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:51.740]  your child.
[03:15:51.740 --> 03:15:52.740]  Exactly.
[03:15:52.740 --> 03:15:53.740]  What a load of bull.
[03:15:53.740 --> 03:15:57.420]  You cannot test to prove that the poison is in you. How's that? So you can-
[03:15:57.420 --> 03:15:58.940]  Because they said so.
[03:15:58.940 --> 03:16:03.020]  Exactly. And this was before even they passed this law that now they are protected from
[03:16:03.020 --> 03:16:05.460]  any issue. This was before that. I'm talking about-
[03:16:05.460 --> 03:16:09.620]  Just like the vaccine makers said, we'll carry out this operation, but give us liability
[03:16:09.620 --> 03:16:10.620]  protection.
[03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:15.340]  Yeah, imagine, I'm chasing them since 2006. And I don't want money, and I don't want nothing.
[03:16:15.340 --> 03:16:19.300]  I just want them to stop hurting other children.
[03:16:19.300 --> 03:16:21.340]  But there's too many people, Andrea.
[03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:22.660]  Yes, I mean-
[03:16:22.660 --> 03:16:24.420]  They're trying to help us.
[03:16:24.420 --> 03:16:29.100]  Absolutely. I'm doing for my kids. I promised them to pay whoever calls this to them, and
[03:16:29.100 --> 03:16:33.020]  I will until my, to the teeth. I mean-
[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:36.580]  Wow, you mean you're gonna defend yourself? That sounds even more extreme.
[03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:38.540]  Oh, they have no idea when-
[03:16:38.540 --> 03:16:46.620]  Two words, roll over. Give in to them. Henry Kissinger said, use food as a weapon. Destabilize
[03:16:46.620 --> 03:16:51.860]  countries, murder people in mass. What's wrong with that? Henry Kissinger's a beautiful person.
[03:16:51.860 --> 03:16:56.580]  He deserves to live. You and your family don't. You want to thank him for all he's done?
[03:16:56.580 --> 03:17:01.580]  Let me tell you, he's an ugly man. I mean, he doesn't need to be replicated. Please don't.
[03:17:01.580 --> 03:17:02.580]  Man.
[03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:07.260]  You know, we call him a super mass murderer, potato head, you know.
[03:17:07.260 --> 03:17:15.020]  Yeah, he's pretty ugly. And so if something, try to replicate beautiful people, not just
[03:17:15.020 --> 03:17:18.700]  outside but inside. And he's ugly both ways, inside out.
[03:17:18.700 --> 03:17:22.140]  This time, the cover does match the book.
[03:17:22.140 --> 03:17:29.900]  Well, we need to start as a community. And the reason I'm here for today is I beg these
[03:17:29.900 --> 03:17:35.940]  mothers that are listening to me right now, doing this interview, to get united. Stop
[03:17:35.940 --> 03:17:40.500]  with the bologna and get united, and let's stop consuming GMOs. We could totally destroy
[03:17:40.500 --> 03:17:41.500]  them.
[03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:47.260]  Oh yeah, Monsanto last week was saying, be nice, stop, back off. No, like the hell 9000
[03:17:47.260 --> 03:17:51.820]  when they're turning it off. If we just don't buy their stuff, it's over. We vote with our
[03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:52.820]  dollars.
[03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:53.820]  Exactly.
[03:17:53.820 --> 03:17:56.300]  That's why they want to bankrupt everybody so that everybody's so poor they can only
[03:17:56.300 --> 03:17:58.940]  get the stuff they'll basically give you for free.
[03:17:58.940 --> 03:18:04.460]  Well, they do give you for free, you know. It's insane, but certain groups that, like
[03:18:04.460 --> 03:18:08.260]  I told you, the World Health Organization got the Starlink instead of destroying it,
[03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:09.980]  when I gave it to the poor people in Central America.
[03:18:09.980 --> 03:18:15.540]  Well, the World Health Organization has been caught in India and Africa and in South America
[03:18:15.540 --> 03:18:18.700]  going and adding a sterilant to the vaccines. This is on record.
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:23.540]  Yeah, I know, and it's more ugly that movie stars in Hollywood are supporting this.
[03:18:23.540 --> 03:18:31.620]  I had our pediatrician who owned one, he's now retired. He owned the biggest pediatrician
[03:18:31.620 --> 03:18:38.420]  clinic in Austin, and they would not do vaccines if you wanted, but they did vaccines as well.
[03:18:38.420 --> 03:18:41.900]  And he called me aside, I won't say his name. He said, let me tell you something, you know,
[03:18:41.900 --> 03:18:47.180]  we're supposed to continue to education, you know, do some charity stuff at the East Austin
[03:18:47.180 --> 03:18:48.180]  clinics.
[03:18:48.180 --> 03:18:56.060]  And he goes, I refuse to do it, but he goes, they were giving him 1960s liquid, the batch
[03:18:56.060 --> 03:19:01.900]  numbers with SV40 cancer to the East Austin kids. I said, you gotta go public. And he
[03:19:01.900 --> 03:19:05.120]  goes, you're a journalist, he grabbed him by the arm, and he goes, I just told you that
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:06.120]  off record.
[03:19:06.120 --> 03:19:09.060]  You can say you were told that by a doctor in Austin, but you don't say that. The guy
[03:19:09.060 --> 03:19:13.260]  had my arm, just like a well-known doctor. There's probably a thousand people listening
[03:19:13.260 --> 03:19:17.280]  that their kids went to him. And I said, well, you gotta tell people, and he said, nope,
[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:21.580]  just like doctor privilege, your journalist privilege, you do not repeat that, you know,
[03:19:21.580 --> 03:19:22.580]  that came from me.
[03:19:22.580 --> 03:19:25.540]  That's the same thing that all these years I've been dealing with, Alex.
[03:19:25.540 --> 03:19:27.900]  They give the kids in East Austin cancer.
[03:19:27.900 --> 03:19:28.900]  Yes.
[03:19:28.900 --> 03:19:31.220]  SV40 will give you cancer.
[03:19:31.220 --> 03:19:34.660]  I don't know what the American people are waiting for. I mean, at this point, they are
[03:19:34.660 --> 03:19:40.380]  destroying our children. What else do you want them to take away from you? I wouldn't
[03:19:40.380 --> 03:19:43.140]  even care if they would have told me, give me your house, give me-
[03:19:43.140 --> 03:19:47.940]  Exactly, why are we scared of Monsanto? Come after me, whatever. I'm not going to be part
[03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:54.100]  of this. SV40, that then binds into your DNA and kills you 20 years later, and they're
[03:19:54.100 --> 03:20:00.060]  there giving them the kids. Here's your SV40. Bye-bye, Bluebird. We'll be right back.
[03:20:00.060 --> 03:20:07.700]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:20:07.700 --> 03:20:12.780]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[03:20:12.780 --> 03:20:19.740]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

[03:20:53.020 --> 03:21:03.980]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. Your home alarm works
[03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:08.900]  after an intruder is inside your home, but real home security begins before intruders

[03:21:17.860 --> 03:21:22.940]  response is often greater than 20 minutes. You can't afford to wait that long. Stop burglars

[03:22:01.020 --> 03:22:05.020]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic
[03:22:05.020 --> 03:22:10.340]  growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression? Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:10.340 --> 03:22:14.620]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[03:22:14.620 --> 03:22:19.080]  is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven. But what
[03:22:19.080 --> 03:22:24.260]  do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors
[03:22:24.260 --> 03:22:29.060]  are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:29.060 --> 03:22:33.660]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing
[03:22:33.660 --> 03:22:38.380]  costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures. The
[03:22:38.380 --> 03:22:46.380]  book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237. Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year

[03:22:58.300 --> 03:23:07.560]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:12.300]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:21.860]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They sew pride
[03:23:21.860 --> 03:23:31.140]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the
[03:23:31.140 --> 03:23:39.300]  crotch where you need it most. Blue Diamond Gusset's got it, others don't.
[03:23:39.300 --> 03:23:46.100]  We turn jeans inside out. Diamond Gusset Jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[03:23:57.980 --> 03:24:05.460]  Others don't. All right folks, final segment live. She'll
[03:24:05.460 --> 03:24:08.860]  be back on the nightly news with Mike Adams tonight at seven o'clock central. Be sure
[03:24:08.860 --> 03:24:12.940]  to tell all your friends, family to tune in. One membership is good for 11 people. To log
[03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:17.580]  in with the same username, passcode prisonplanet.tv. Please take advantage of that. Recruit people
[03:24:17.580 --> 03:24:21.200]  in to wake them up. Here's an article that was in the Prairie Advocate News. They posted
[03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:27.780]  a blurb of it up on planetinfoawars.com. This happened two days ago. Bees resistant to Monsanto
[03:24:27.780 --> 03:24:31.780]  Roundup illegally seized by the Illinois Ag Department. They claim Roundup's not even
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:35.900]  meant to kill bees because, but of course it does, because people want them pollinating.
[03:24:35.900 --> 03:24:40.900]  But somebody goes, wow, these bees aren't dying. Insects will become resistant and immune.
[03:24:40.900 --> 03:24:46.780]  Oh my gosh, they seized them saying it's the property of Monsanto. So I guess it'd be like
[03:24:46.780 --> 03:24:50.980]  if they patented lead and I shot you in the head instead of me getting arrested that they
[03:24:50.980 --> 03:24:55.260]  arrest the corpse and say because it has lead in it. And so, oh my God, don't want the people
[03:24:55.260 --> 03:24:58.100]  to find out what's happening here. You're not going to be able to stop all the bees
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:01.460]  from coming, you know, stopping you. They're going to become resistors just like humans
[03:25:01.460 --> 03:25:05.260]  are. And, but, but, but you're talking about what happened to the German scientists and
[03:25:05.260 --> 03:25:09.460]  others. They do not want you looking at what they're doing to you. I mean, why are the
[03:25:09.460 --> 03:25:14.920]  courts doing this? Because they own them. Well, it's, it's, it's horrible. It's totally
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:22.180]  conspiracy against humanity because it was this Dr. Cass, this German scientist who was
[03:25:22.180 --> 03:25:29.140]  actually conducting and dissecting the bees intestines. And you, it was all over the internet
[03:25:29.140 --> 03:25:34.180]  when I got this information. Luckily I saved it and I printed and I, and I, and I saved
[03:25:34.180 --> 03:25:39.660]  it on my hard drives. Now you can't find it anymore. Because Monsanto owns the bee guts.
[03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:44.720]  They own the bee guts. And he actually proved that these bees were dying because they had
[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:54.180]  a lot of undigested, undigested proteins from these BT crops. And, and, and it was causing
[03:25:54.180 --> 03:25:56.420]  leaky gut to the bees.
[03:25:56.420 --> 03:26:00.220]  Just like we're seeing incredible intestinal disorder skyrocket.
[03:26:00.220 --> 03:26:01.220]  Exactly.
[03:26:01.220 --> 03:26:05.180]  And Monsanto's now bought leading bee research firm, everything implicated in bee colony
[03:26:05.180 --> 03:26:06.180]  collapse.
[03:26:06.180 --> 03:26:07.180]  Exactly.
[03:26:07.180 --> 03:26:08.180]  Oh, but there's nothing going on.
[03:26:08.180 --> 03:26:09.180]  No.
[03:26:09.180 --> 03:26:13.320]  And again, you look at Monsanto, their famous eugenics operation and, and, and just everything
[03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:14.320]  else you can imagine.
[03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:15.320]  Yeah.
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:21.260]  And people refute me and said, oh no, eh, you cannot blame BioPest, but, but GMOs because
[03:26:21.260 --> 03:26:27.860]  they were introduced in 1996 for human consumption. Autism has been there since 1942.
[03:26:27.860 --> 03:26:29.860]  It's been skyrocketing.
[03:26:29.860 --> 03:26:34.820]  Excuse me, do a better research, okay? Don't defeat me on something that I became an expert
[03:26:34.820 --> 03:26:41.600]  on because of my son. BioPestas has been on our field since 1929. And I can prove it to
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:47.900]  you. It's in, it's in my website, the reference on the book that I actually photocopied before.
[03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:54.300]  They probably disappeared the book from the, from the public library in LA.
[03:26:54.300 --> 03:26:57.980]  Books don't exist. That's so embarrassing. In closing, you were pointing out though,
[03:26:57.980 --> 03:27:00.860]  it's all sorts of other health problems. It's not just the autism.
[03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:06.260]  Exactly. So people that are listening to this interview and they think, oh, boring. It's
[03:27:06.260 --> 03:27:10.660]  not my, my son doesn't have autism, so I shouldn't listen to this. Then listen, and then look
[03:27:10.660 --> 03:27:15.820]  at your kids again. And why they have so many allergies to food? Maybe, haven't you asked
[03:27:15.820 --> 03:27:18.600]  that maybe the answer is in the food, not in your child?
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:21.300]  Why are people more and more allergic to everything?
[03:27:21.300 --> 03:27:26.780]  Exactly. And why they keep saying, oh, your kid is allergic. Take, take Gallegra or whatever.
[03:27:26.780 --> 03:27:29.420]  No, throw away the food and give the food to everyone.
[03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:31.700]  Yeah, it's like, oh, you're allergic, turn off your immune system.
[03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:32.700]  No.
[03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:34.580]  And then you turn your immune system off, you get cancer.
[03:27:34.580 --> 03:27:38.900]  No, they say, if you are allergic, it's because of you. You're, you're, you're.
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:42.660]  Oh no, now they're saying women are all getting breast cancer because they have bad genes.
[03:27:42.660 --> 03:27:45.300]  Your grandmother had the same genes and didn't get breast cancer.
[03:27:45.300 --> 03:27:46.300]  Exactly. But.
[03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:50.060]  Yes, you have the genes that when they put pesticides in your food, you die.
[03:27:50.060 --> 03:27:54.420]  All these, all these diseases that our children are having, they are turning her around and
[03:27:54.420 --> 03:27:55.420]  blaming on the parents.
[03:27:55.420 --> 03:28:00.180]  Oh, I've had all the scientists on. What happens to guinea pigs, rats and pigs in, in double
[03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:04.960]  blind studies, given these cross species, BT type, the whole spectrum is the same thing
[03:28:04.960 --> 03:28:08.980]  happening to humans. The difference is they have a generation every year or so. We have
[03:28:08.980 --> 03:28:13.940]  it every 20. By the third or fourth generation, they're almost all sterile, dead, deformed.
[03:28:13.940 --> 03:28:14.940]  Exactly.
[03:28:14.940 --> 03:28:18.900]  My God, how are they going to cover this up in another 20 years, though, when, when, when
[03:28:18.900 --> 03:28:22.140]  like a genius can walk, a genius can talk.
[03:28:22.140 --> 03:28:27.780]  Listen, I, another thing that it really bothers me is that these mainstream media and the
[03:28:27.780 --> 03:28:33.380]  people that, that support these, these companies keep saying the, the, the population that
[03:28:33.380 --> 03:28:37.500]  we have scientific studies, we, I mean, are, are, are the population an idiot?
[03:28:37.500 --> 03:28:41.580]  Let's just say study, study, fluoride's good for you.
[03:28:41.580 --> 03:28:45.020]  If somebody with a white coat tells you something, that is suddenly-
[03:28:45.020 --> 03:28:49.380]  Listen, every year they say there are no side effects from vaccines, and then you read the
[03:28:49.380 --> 03:28:50.860]  insert and says it can kill you.
[03:28:50.860 --> 03:28:51.860]  Yeah.
[03:28:51.860 --> 03:28:52.860]  They're lying.
[03:28:52.860 --> 03:28:58.100]  What, what matters with autistic kids have done is go to the books. Grab a damn book.
[03:28:58.100 --> 03:28:59.300]  I mean, you can do it.
[03:28:59.300 --> 03:29:04.100]  They've got mad scientists that are eugenicists that founded all these companies that are
[03:29:04.100 --> 03:29:08.180]  designing Trojan horse weapons systems. Do you have any doubt this is on purpose?
[03:29:08.180 --> 03:29:09.180]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[03:29:09.180 --> 03:29:10.900]  Do you think it's on purpose?
[03:29:10.900 --> 03:29:18.020]  Oh yeah, I have this, I trace it to who invented this BT toxin all the way to the Nazis in
[03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:22.300]  Germany. They were getting prepared for the, they were getting prepared for the, for the
[03:29:22.300 --> 03:29:23.980]  war and they started with a chemical.
[03:29:23.980 --> 03:29:27.620]  No, that's right. They said they're going to take over and then feed people poison food
[03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:30.380]  so they wouldn't know who was killing them because people will resist if you line them
[03:29:30.380 --> 03:29:32.260]  up and shoot them. You're actually, you're correct again.
[03:29:32.260 --> 03:29:35.620]  What happened is the war ended and they didn't know what to do with this. So now what they
[03:29:35.620 --> 03:29:39.180]  did is they sold it to America to delude it and use it as a special.
[03:29:39.180 --> 03:29:42.740]  Because the Nazis actually came from eugenicists here, so they were just coming back home.
[03:29:42.740 --> 03:29:43.740]  Exactly.
[03:29:43.740 --> 03:29:47.620]  All right, folks can check out your website, holisticapproachforautism.com. She'll be on
[03:29:47.620 --> 03:29:50.700]  the news tonight. Seven o'clock. Be there, folks.
[03:29:50.700 --> 03:29:53.180]  We're on the march. The empire's on the road.
[03:29:53.180 --> 03:29:56.820]  We're resisting. Are you? We're fighting. Are you?
[03:29:56.820 --> 03:29:58.860]  We're not giving up. We're not rolling over. Are you?
