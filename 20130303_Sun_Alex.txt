rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
ladies and gentlemen it is Sunday the third day of March 2013 I am your host
Alex Jones I want to thank you all for tuning in on this Sunday worldwide
transmission coming up today we've got the encore presentation for you with
some key information but we're also gonna have some new info today as well
but coming up right after the break my interview with Congressman Ron Paul
earlier in the week it's so important we're gonna re-air that on this Sunday
broadcast and then we've got the Michael Savage interview and whether you love
Michael Savage or hate Michael Savage he's definitely interesting and
informative makes a lot of good points and the fact that we can get the second
biggest to third biggest depending on who you look at it might be George
Norie might be Michael Savage but he's right about most groups of the second
biggest radio talk show host in the United States that we could get Michael
Savage on and you know communicate with him and and and and hopefully wake him
up to some of the things he's not aware of and also get his audience more awake
and to tune into what we're doing that is a win-win-win-win-win and then we've
got some big excerpts of not last Sunday when he called in live but from the
Thursday broadcast with the one the only Ted Nugent so please call your friends
and family and tell him to tune into this Sunday broadcast remember the
system doesn't want you to be aware of this information that's why they
stonewall you and say there are no drones when the drone program is even
admitted that's why they engage in all these activities Watson did an article
about Sarah Palin you know talking about two billion rounds of ammo they're
admitted in the federal government's own purchase orders and online in in in
public filings and a bunch of publications so-called liberal
publications authoritarian publications came out and said that she was insane
that it was just totally made up and an internet rumor giving no proof I mean
just a new level of propagandizing the public like there's some foreign
occupying army which they are the foreign occupying army of the globalist
so pretty incredible those articles are up in info wars calm and prison planet
calm and also a story from Thursday that I want to talk more about is breaking
Texas moves to forcibly inoculate children that's what it is
SB 63 and there's another draconian bill that we'll get to in a moment in fact
I'll cover it at the first little five-minute segment of the second hour
I'm gonna get back into this exclusively they come out and are saying you know
just like California we're gonna have your ten-year-old just give us consent
to give them any shots or basically drugs we want but this is inoculations
ladies and gentlemen a child can't walk in and buy a car a child isn't allowed
to have sex with some pervert and the pervert can't say well they gave
consent now this is absolutely incredible so breaking Texas moves to
forcibly inoculate children the bill is SB 63 has a good chance of passing got
big vaccine money behind it remember governor Perry lied and said it was the
law to take Gardasil well now they're actually trying to make it the law where
they can just say to your kid wants some candy hey get in the get in the van kid
come on I got a puppy dog now it's like hey want some candy want to be able to
get extracurricular you know prizes we'll take these shots is what they do
in California they say they sign the law last year so that's SB number 64 in
Texas look in your state it's happening all over the country that's an SB 64 is
anybody involved in childcare period whether you work at the YMCA or at a
daycare center you got to take any of the 50-plus shots they're saying are
quote mandatory now they've never been mandatory but they hoax and said they
were now that you're finding out it's not mandatory they're going okay we'll
pass a law to make it mandatory first it's the nurses then it's the medical
workers then it's the people that carry the trash out at the medical facility
and then it's everybody in child health care and then it's everybody period all

live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones former
congressman Ron Paul best-selling author joins us I wanted to get him on because
he's been writing and speaking and posting articles at campaign for Liberty
breaking down the bubble is really getting big the QE unlimited and the
global currency crises with the very authors of the currency crises posing as
our saviors and just last week more proposals by the g20 for a bank of the
world SDR that's global government to back it all up Ron Paul dr. Ron Paul
thank you for coming on sir thank you good to be with you can you give us the
latest on your analysis on what's happening with the economy and this big
event you've been talking about last few years how how close are we right now how
serious is this currency war I think in many ways we're in the middle of it I
think the evidence to the general public is still not there and there's not been
a panic but the people in Washington and even our central bankers don't face up
to the real truth of the matter net is we're totally bankrupt and yet just
putting more money and running up more debt seems to settle the markets they
don't dump their stocks they they don't dump their bonds but we're in the middle
of some unwinding I think that this is so much different than anything we've
gone through you know since World War two and especially even since 1971 with
the breakdown of Bretton Woods but one of these days we'll wake up some
morning and realize that the whole world has given up on the system just as we
woke up one day and the world and especially the Soviets gave up on the
Soviet Union because the system we have the monetary system we have in the
economic system is not viable it can't work and you can't solve the problem of
debt with more debt and when that particular day comes I don't think
anybody knows the exact day but we're certainly getting very close to it
congressman getting into specifics and your research there with the Von Mies
Institute pretty much everything you predicted in the last 30 years is now
unfolding from all my research and even with the establishment saying and the
way they're behaving it's all coming to a head now it's two billion rounds of
bullets and hollow points that are illegal under the Geneva Convention we've
got a new report out where Homeland Security is funding domestic drones and
I'm not making this up to quote track gun purchases that just broke at
infowars.com now we see military drills expanding everywhere we see the new
Justice Department memo saying hey let's just ban guns and confiscate them it's
like I've woken up in an Orwellian nightmare and we've got this this
normalcy bias this mass Stockholm syndrome where even mainline
conservatives I had Ted Nugent on yesterday you know he said look the
green lights been given on Benghazi the green lights been given on all this
other tyranny Fast and Furious nobody got in trouble and so I think we've
reached that point where the tyrants figure out that if they can take us an
inch why not take us a million miles. I've been getting away with it but don't you
think this has started a while back and it's just accelerating if you go if you
go back to what happened at Waco if you go back to what happened at Ruby Ridge I
mean if they can get away with it they do it and nobody ever got punished for
those mistakes that were made and now nobody gets punished at all matter of
fact the Congress goes along with it that Congress doesn't really resist and
put restraints on the president when it comes to kill this and the use of drones
and assassinations and the funding continues so it's it's a very dangerous
time that we live in. Undoubtedly specifically with all the
paramilitary buildup the the arms race going on domestically what do you think
the feds are planning what do you think they're preparing for Dr. Paul? Well I
think they prepare for everything and they themselves you know go with the
flow they don't know exactly what will happen but they're prepared they don't
know that in two months from now there's riots in the street but they know that
there could be in the same way with the monetary system they argue academically
that oh yes it's okay to print money and debt doesn't matter you know the Paul
Krugman argument but I think they know exactly what can happen the consequence
that we warn about and try to prepare for so they make their preparations like
I think you mentioned in your introduction about what what they do at
the international level under the UN and the IMF and the you know these group of
20 and all these they do plan so we we know what would be the answer that is
sound money and honest money and have a commodity money they want to maintain
their power so they're laying their plans too but I don't think they know
the day they're going to use it they plan for all contingencies because the
action of human beings are not predictable but when certain events come
about they're laying their plans in their network so and it's really scary
when you think about the drone the drone thing should you know wake up everybody
on what they can do how much surveillance how many weapons can they
carry when when they pretend that they can target any one individual thousands
of miles away from the United States with people who maneuver those things
even here what can they do if they decide well we're going after this drug
dealer we're going after this guy that owns an illegal weapon who knows what
and we do know is in spite of their fantastic you know ability you know the
advancement in these weapons we do know that they make a lot of mistakes there's
a lot of collateral damage and they just write it off and so I would expect that
the people in charge know that there's trouble ahead and they're laying their
plans sure to react in any way they need think necessary undoubtedly and I want
you to break this down in your own words but you've spoken to it before but I
marvel we've had big government we've had tyrannies before around the world
but the the socialist collectivist clash funded by the big special interest that
won a monopoly obviously of power to write health care of course you know
about this being a retired medical doctor but my dad's a dentist oral
surgeon he's also in medical management and he said to me said son I knew it
when I read the bill but he's watching it happen making people erasing payroll
taxes on poor people taxes on investments doubling premiums this year
I mean this is designed to kill the American economy that's competing with
China Obama shutting down the power plants that they are clearly trying to
shut down the economy so that everybody goes on welfare and and basically
bankrupts this is an economic takeover can you do you agree with that or can
you speak to that I don't know if I have an absolute insight on all the
motivations because there's a mixture up there I mean there are evil people who
have evil motives and they want to do exactly what's happening there are
others though who are intellectually totally bankrupt and actually believe
this stuff you know I think Paul Krugman doesn't sit down and conspire to blow up
the world and financially I think he sits down and he is dedicated to
proving his philosophy on money and credit are the correct ones and then
there's a lot of other people who are very gullible out there you know how
many people did Obama lose the election oh I mean sure but I mean Obama said he
was gonna give poor people free stuff he's literally raping them so there's
the people are naive enough to believe that so you put all that together and
you end up with this calamity because they do not deal with the world as we
would like to deal with it and that is concentrating on the individuals who
have a right to their own life have a right to the keep the fruits of their
labor have property rights and contract rights and sound money and get the
government out of our way so they don't work on that they work on the opposite
but sure but dr. Paul here's my question trying to figure out exactly their
scheme and their plan and who did what when has to be counteracted by us
getting out in front and saying there is a better way in that way is something
that we had a taste of in this country and we're losing it we need to wake up
the American people that the answers the answers are there for is we just want to
look and I think I think in many ways that is happening a lot more people are
waking up but it's going to be a terribly tough struggle sure I want to
get into the Second Amendment I don't know if you've seen this it broke Friday
but you you're always on to the news I bring up summary of select firearms
violence prevention strategies for the White House by the Department of Justice
actually says basically just outlaw almost all guns and make people turn
them in if they try to take the guns congressman are they trying to start a
civil war you know that's once again is trying to interpret everything that
they're thinking in their planning they're liable to start a civil war by
doing it and for whatever reason they are but they don't believe that people
should have gone they believe the government should have guns and they
believe this very sincerely as as a philosophy so yes they're whether they
that exactly what they want it's hard to say but I know one thing is they don't
want the people to have the guns but you know I don't it's one thing I I think a
lot about these problems but I just don't think that the people are going to
give up their guns you prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if

listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
you are listening to an info wars dot-com frontline report if you are
receiving this transmission you are the resistance
from deep in the heart of FEMA region six Austin Texas transmitting worldwide
it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we have breaking news we have the clevets
coming up with Michael Savage Obama saying again you don't do things
alone in America that's how our system works you didn't build that a new clip
live on CNN 25 minutes ago I was just telling Michael Savage about it during
the break he's like you're kidding he did it again yes we're gonna be playing
that clip but the reason I wanted to get Michael Savage on is a time for war
Michael Savage many number one New York Times bestsellers 30-something books
multiple doctorates I'm not gonna go over his whole bio most of you know who
he is in the talk radio world or you're hiding under a rock somewhere but he
also writes for World Net Daily they are censoring this and you know this is a
big subject I've talked about you noticed that red dawn was held up red
dawn 2 for two years as the Chinese government demanded and threatened
Hollywood because it was Chinese as the bad guys attacking America that was
re-edited and made to North Koreans costing a millions of dollars to reshoot
and re-edit now Michael Savage breaking WorldNetDaily.com China lobby
censoring new book and we'll get this story linked up at Infowars.com as well
and this is not a ploy to sell books Michael Savage arguably the number two
number one talk show host in the country doesn't usually do this because I
listen to the show and followed it to sell books this is in a news blackout
because across the board China owns our fraudulent debt China has thousands of
front companies Al Gore's on the board of Apple with Fox com and the suicide
nets they are the liberal tyrants and they are the new globalist muscle
Michael Savage joins us with this breaking news and Michael it is so
exciting to get you on the broadcast well it's always good to be honest
especially someone who kicked the limeys behind on air as you as you well know
you know what I think of of the the spineless side of the Brits I always
admire was always an Anglo file until this thing came along where this slime
the socialist slime slanted me and said I said things I didn't say and I'm the
only American broadcaster Alex not allowed to enter Britain I'm on a list
with murderers and terrorists and nobody in the media with the exception of Alex
Jones right now dares even talk about how is that possible
why is my State Department not lobbying on my behalf but let's not go into the
England thing it's great to be on your show it's great to have you here as long
as we can keep you know you got your own show coming up tonight let's first plug
that because you now are on cumulus and exploding across the country well that's
pretty good number one they're the best company in the business and I'm not just
saying it because I work with them they are the best company in the business
number one number two I'm on the best stations in the country for example Alex
I finally got on in New York City on W ABC nine o'clock at night now what
happened Michael Savage who's he I exploded within two months to number one
amongst younger listeners mainly males I mean women as you well know are not a
big listenership in talk radio in general I always joke I say have eight
listeners eight women listeners across the country they're busy not having kids
as the whole West dies well the men listen but here's the question Alex
because you have a younger demo and guys mainly why are they listening to you why
why did they find Michael Savage an older guy on W ABC I beat other talk
stations I beat all new stations I beats because young people are looking for men
role models in the age of crucifying John Wayne they understand they're
having their testicles chopped off and they want to fight back and have a
future well first they have their their testicles cut off chemically they're
chemical eyes to destroy their masculinity right and if they survive
the chemical castration the next thing is the educational castration if they
survive the chemical and educational crash castration I mean what's left for
them they don't know which way to turn in this country you know Alex last week
I started my show by saying I saw a kung fu movie when I was out on vacation
last week I was watching a lot of television and there was a picture of a
kung fu Academy in China with thousands of young Chinese being taught by a
really tough mean kung fu teacher and he's saying to them no weakness no pain
no mercy and he says what do we learn here the Chinese scream back in Chinese
no weakness no pain no mercy and I say look at my sad sack country we have a
government and an educational establishment teaching our children to
say I'm weak I'm in pain this hurts that hurts I need the government to help me
now who wins this battle in the long run Alex that doesn't take a genius to
figure out what's happening does it no okay so that's where we're at so now we
know that China has lobbied very effectively in Hollywood the Hollywood
sewer pipe as I've called it affectionately for 20 years now the
Hollywood sewer pipe is controlled by many different factors but the number
one factor is money since China controls the money flow to the banks and the
banks control Hollywood we don't have to figure out who controls Hollywood do we
so my agent said to me when I told him my book is being sabotaged from the top
and I'll explain it in a minute my agent called me he said this and I'm
quoting Alex this is a top New York literary agent he said from the
government to mainstream media oh no that's him but here he said from the
government to mainstream media there is a petrifying fear of China and the
potential loss of their hypothetical business the agent said to savage he
was reminded of a conversation he had with the top Hollywood executive who
said to him they wouldn't produce any films that were anti-china for fear of
being blackballed in their market basically letting the Chinese government
censor our movies in this country then he said to me savage there must be a way
to galvanize conservative media behind the time for war as the only book
willing to take on China the agent told savage well guess what Alex aside from
you nobody will discuss this book and its premise well let's break down what
they're censoring here but to tie in Obama shutting down dozens of power
plants a week they're not letting new plants open they're totally clean coal
power plants about 51% of our power this is brand new this just happened at the
end of the last hour Obama is in Newport Virginia at one of the shipyards talking
about getting America going and I saw this on CNN during the break earlier I
couldn't believe it now let's get into your book here that they're trying to
censor the premise of the book that I'm holding in my hand a time for war with
Michael Savage well if the premise is quite simple which is that okay it
starts with a helicopter in Afghanistan a Chinook carrying a squad of Navy SEALs
plummeting to the earth in Afghanistan remember when that happened in 11 when
our great commander-in-chief was never blamed for the loss of more Navy SEALs
in one incident than in a than in the entire history of the knee of the SEALs
unit how come there's never been an investigation of who put all those Navy
SEALs in a single old flying helicopter and flew them into a hot zone who did
that who in the military made that decision or worse yet was a decision
made by someone other than in the military why has there been no
Republican outcry that's how my book begins but the question is what happens
next well I fictionalized that story in order to make America wake up to the
fact that maybe just maybe someone will ask who killed all our Navy SEALs and
number two my allegation meaning through my fiction it's a novel a time for war
is that there's a Chinese agent in Afghanistan who brings it down with an
EMP attack and the whole book is basically about a lethal conspiracy to
not only neutralize our military but also a two-pronged attack that will
disarm the American military through EMP blasts and then release a deadly toxin
killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and my hero Jack Hatfield and
Dover a young lady race to locate this new ground zero and save it on suspecting
country that's the theme of a time for war in my novel it's a novel it's a
novel that's what it is

coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
network network
so Alex the question is where do I come up with the theory that I am being
manipulated or they're doing it all over the place I mean the government's owned
by China now the the globalists signed us on to communism and use NAFTA and
all these rules to shut down our industry so only China could thrive
they got their population jumping off suicide nets I mean this is how they
brought America down yeah but let me let me answer the question people gonna say
savage still didn't answer the fact that he's making a great charge here that the
China Lobby is censoring his new book where is the proof right well let me
give you one piece of evidence because I'm trained as a scientist and the only
proof is a series of evidence evidentiary facts it's like a court of
law right we can't definitively show you a video of Chinese agents sitting and
talking and saying kill the book I can show you facts and let people draw the
conclusions for themselves when this book first came out there was an ad
campaign that was leading with is China already at war with the US okay that was
the lead line is China already at war with the US by the time the book
appeared that ad line was dropped and it became it became a book about terrorism
generic okay a generic book about terrorism secondly we had an ad
campaign planned for the day of launch which was last week on a Tuesday it was
supposed to be on the top of some major websites that will not mention which I
woke up early in the morning looking forward to seeing the ads they didn't
appear I was screaming and yelling all day long finally a word came back that
it was bumped because of this it was bumped because of that it was a mistake
and the ads that were made meant to run was suddenly running on Sunday morning
and in Sunday midnight they were never appearing where they were supposed to
appear it didn't happen by accident Alex money was paid contracts were signed
this was shafted from the top down can I prove it no but I could offer some
evidence and the publisher is owned by a German holding company by the way
without smearing the publisher for obvious reasons there's hardly an
American publisher left that isn't owned by an international publisher this one
is owned by the biggest publishing group in the world which happens to be
headquartered in Germany we all well know that the Germans are interested in
penetrating the Chinese market is that correct
absolutely well I mean as the CFR has said in the New World Order everything's
being positioned to China to leverage everybody out of the lowest common
denominator to bring in this system well the one good news about it all is I've
always liked Chinese food so maybe I can look forward to that but the thing is
you know I you know that wouldn't be the bad that would be the only good news of
the whole thing is it's not a bad cuisine if you if you don't get low low
salt low fat Chinese food which is impossible fine in San Francisco you
know is this sinophobia Alex because we're gonna be accused you look you're a
renegade broadcaster I'm somewhat of a renegade broadcaster you know that we're
sort of outcast and we love it because that's what we are we don't want to be
one of these old men sitting on the boardwalk with our pants legs rolled up
complaining like bill planted yesterday from CBS did you hear that sound clip
you got to hear this one bill plant complains to his friend Howie kites of
the major media you know Howie kites and bill plant and bill says this he says
we've gotten used to being called whiny lap dogs I've heard it for 30 years but
he said this is about access to the president and access to the president's
been cut and pushed and curtailed over every administration I've covered but
here's the nub of it Howie this administration has the tools to reach
people on their own now they don't need us that much and to the extent that
they're able to do that Howie they're undercutting the First Amendment which
guarantees a free press through many voices isn't that hilarious that's right
this these idiots sold out repeated and regurgitated what the establishment said
and now they're being totally cut off and they're complaining yeah that a free
press through many voices as long as they're all liberal voices certainly
you've never been on the free press I've never been heard from by the free press
we don't exist Alex our large audiences don't exist they're the ultimate sensors
legends in their own mind who sit up there on a mountain telling us what
exists and doesn't exist did you see Gibbs regardless where you stand on the
drone program saying he was told to say the program didn't exist like the Wizard
of Oz even when the program was public did you see that yeah I'm not a big fan
of Gibbs I happen to like drones I know you and I disagree on this I'd rather
see a drone go and kill a real terrorist than sending an American platoon over
there to do I know I'm talking about him being domestically used against us or
against drones in America you know the only drone I would approve of would be a
drone manned by a government official remember Hitler used the first drones
they were called v1s and v2s remember the unmanned rockets that he sent on
England what now our own government is using v1s against us absolutely and in
fact Michael Savage here with us the crews doing a great job trying to
capture stuff live off TV we do drumroll please have the clip of Obama at a
shipbuilding factory in Virginia just about 30 minutes ago he said this this
is breaking you didn't build it statement number two from CNN here it is
but in order for us to make that happen I'm gonna need you you know the the one
thing about being president is after four years you get pretty humble maybe
you wouldn't but actually you become more humble you don't know you realize
yeah you know all the mistakes you make but you also realize you can't do things
by yourself that's not how our system works you've got to have the help and
the goodwill of Congress and what that means is you've got to make sure that
constituents of members of Congress are putting some pressure on so again that's
a backhanded way he's saying oh I can't be a dictator but what he's really
saying the factory is you can't do things by yourself well I think what
he's saying is I need you to run to Congress and make them cave in and make
sure I can give increases in taxes again is what he's really saying of course he
doesn't believe anyone does anything without the government's help this is
how statists think this is how status have been brainwashed from childhood to
believe that for example Picasso didn't paint his painting by himself he'd argue
that he had to go buy the paints he had to buy the paintbrush he had to buy the
easel and he had to rent the model but other individuals contributed to make a
better choice and more variance in society the idea of collectivism all it
creates is nightmares but we understand that but Alex listen to how they think
you know as well as I do how they think why do you think that in the Soviet
Union of the past and in China today there is no individual art the art has
to be state-approved art is that correct how different is that then state
approved art in America today where there are very few creative artists who
are ever seen unless they're working through the National Endowment for the
humanities National Endowments for the Arts or they're in a university tenured
position you don't see or hear from them because they're not state-sponsored we
are becoming increasingly like a Soviet state we understand that Alex and we're
fighting against it the question to you Alex is people are screaming what the
heck can I do about it I've tried look what they gave us in the last election a
choice between mr. miltoast and the communists the naked Marxist then the
naked Marxist Obama floods America with illegal aliens three months before the
election by granting amnesty through the quote dream act without congressional
approval there wasn't a peep a peep out of the drunks called Republicans well
Michael that was my next point is that isn't it time for impeachment it was a
long time ago he says our military's under NATO control he goes on to say
that he can have cybersecurity shut down a free speech if Congress doesn't act he
says now he can legalize the illegal aliens by fiat well you and I can't go
to Mexico and have babies for free and everything paid for they're taking
American hospitality and using it to literally bankrupt this country and
isn't that their goal is to bankrupt things to collectivize it I'm not sure
that they want to bankrupt the country I think they just simply are into
controlling it and remember Alex my analogy is different than yours there
was a TV show called the Sopranos you probably don't watch much TV I've seen
it yeah the monster so it's when the mobsters from New Jersey they run a
gambling private gambling den right they get a guy and was a friend of theirs by
the way owns a huge sporting goods store and they tell him don't gamble you're a
sick degenerate gambler he gambles anyway he loses all of his money so the
Mafia gets their hands into his sporting goods store right now the next scene is
they already move into the store they get in the back room and they're taking
stuff out of the back door they now own the guy not only they busting out the
store by selling things in the back out of trucks now they're getting they're
taking a line of credit Alex that the store has and they're running up
first-class airline tickets to the tune of millions of dollars what does that
sound like to you it sounds like we've been taken over by the same gang that
took over the sporting goods store and they're busting us out by running up our
credit taking our credit line I totally agree with you that's that's my
analysis exactly it's like a gang took over America how dumb do you have to be
not to snow it's government anarchy as you call it it is government anarchy and
that's a phrase I was using but people don't understand what I say Alex maybe
some do have a big audience let me bring this up why do all of the major
conservative libertarian hosts talk crap about each other or start fights I don't
do that and but when I'm listening to talk radio they're constantly sniping at
you and then acting like you're sniping at them when they're starting it and
then I've got you know mr. mr. Beck behind the scenes always trying to make
stuff up why don't they get there's gonna be no country in the future if we
don't Alex here's the answer when you delete sled dog the other dogs are
barking at your ass I guess that's true yeah

coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
network network defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex
Jones what about Dorner yeah the whole system was paralyzed for a week over one
guy how do they think they're gonna start a civil war by the way he was a
pro gun guy who then I mean an anti gun guy who was then out there using guns to
reportedly shoot police that was a crazy case and what the media did the vermin
in the media and I'll say it until I until people hear me okay I won't use a
word that's so charged the cilantro rates in the media the worms in the
media the worms in the media how's that the worms in the media refused to report
that that mad crazed cop Dorner who was killing people his first two victims
were a couple of a young woman who was of Chinese African American descent and
her fiancee who was African American they wouldn't show their picture Alex we
had a search for it and put it up on Michael Savage calm why did the media
not show that donors first victims were a black man and a Chinese black woman
because then it wouldn't have fit their agenda they wanted to make it about
racial division that's right this the rats the cilantro rates the worms the
worms in the media are trying to destroy us they've destroyed this country the
very same worms that Obama's now saying I don't need you anymore are now crying
that he doesn't need them anymore but it's those worms never forget who
destroyed this country so what is the endgame then if he's even raising taxes
on the payroll of the poorest people I guess drive them into pure bankruptcy to
get on welfare and make them totally dependent wreck the country but but
you're saying you don't think that's the total plan well that's what they're
doing no that's not the plan I think people think that mistakenly let's look
at who doesn't pay taxes in America let's look at General Electric I keep
using that as a prime example for a couple of reasons GE had reportedly an
income of five some billion dollars u.s. income they paid zero taxes because of
the rigged system who is the president of General Electric Jeffrey Immelt what
else does General Electric own NBC and MSNBC why else would they take a street
slime an uneducated dope a street slime rabble-rousing uneducated rat like Al
Sharpton and give him a million dollars a year or more to be on MSNBC because he
keeps the mobs the rent the mobs that are used for years away from Jeffrey
Immelt's General Electric headquarters isn't it cheaper to pay a rat like him a
million dollars right and then Obama made the head of GE the head of the
Economic Council where they selectively can keep their coal power plants open
they get a waiver but everybody else gets shut down it's classic mafia
tactics so well Alex listen if GE paid their fair share and Google paid their
fair share and all the other corporations who are tied into the Obama
administration and now let's go to another one Alex that no one talks about
why are Indian gambling casinos tax-free why don't they pay their fair share
if you're an insider and support the mafia your tax exempt and then they say
people making two hundred some thousand dollars a year are rich dirty rats who
aren't paying enough federal taxes at 40% you add all the rest of it's like
that golfer pays 65% and bitched about it and California said how dare you you
should pay more if GE and the other tax evading corporations paid their fair
share if Indian gambling casinos paid their fair share this budget would be
balanced but nobody will talk about the sacred cows will they because they are
the government in other words they're not separate from the government they
are the government who do you think put this guy in the way how do we stop them
how do we stop them I don't have an answer other than talking about it free
speech has tremendous power it's the proverbial pebble in the compound Alex
if we keep throwing these pebbles into the pond and the rivulets go out to the
edges eventually people will wake up eventually they will act up there is no
other answer that I have Alex I agree with you if we roll over we're in deep
trouble and the problem is the same insider financial interest that are
crony monopolist who want tyranny and a organized command and control economy
they are funding both parties and now you see the mainline Republican Party
demonizing the more hardcore tea party that are our listeners who are actually
just Americans what do you think about the establishment Republicans claiming
that Obama is a mandate for socialism and that Republicans should have open
borders abortion tyranny everything else what do you say to that that attempted
capitulation I say it's a hoax well it's either you want socialism on a fast
track with Obama or socialism on a local train with with the Republicans they're
no different I call them the demakins for for 20 years in radio or the
republic rats what's the difference we have a one-party system it's an
oligarchy we all understand that so the Republican Party is irrelevant it's
become a totally irrelevant party there are some great people in a Ted Cruz
happen to be a big fan of Ted Cruz will they come on the show absolutely not did
Rubio ever want to come on my show absolutely not so they're all
establishment types I understand that but I don't hold it against well here's
an example of style then okay let me just throw this at you I was mad I was
angry I was in a bad mood he was playing factoid games I blew up at Piers Morgan
it was huge news he's scared to have me back they claimed I defeated gun owners
but the truth is it scared them and I met with Morgan later I saw him in
Houston and he said oh we don't want you back on we don't want to make you too
prominent when my audience and your audience dwarfs his by a factor of you
know 10 15 20 times but the issue is we actually I actually kicked their butt
because I actually said get out of your coma wake up they say it's discrediting
to get angry and aggressive the truth is that's one of the only hopes we've got
you agree with that thousand percent get in their face they're a bunch of cowards
every last one of them they're terrified of real men if you can spit in their
face and tell them I said so you have no idea what contempt I have for these
people the media is destroying America and guys like Piers Morgan are the
epitome of everything wrong with the media the fact is Alex you did a great
job I admire you for it and you should keep doing it I myself don't go on any
shows I haven't for years I learned my lesson a long time ago they're snakes
they're the lowest form of well they'll tell you it's live and then do a tape
show while they're taping you while the show's already on but they'll tape it in
a segment and then edit it they're incredibly deceptive and expanding on
that I didn't bring that up to inject myself into the story for listeners I
brought it up to say I believe and I've seen being aggressive with the truth is
the only dog we've got in the fight look you did a great job someone's got a
fight back if more in Congress did what you did we'd be in better shape why
don't you run for office since I have declared it's time for war a time for
war why don't you go to war and run for Congress I'll put it back to you why
don't you run for Congress Michael I thought about it for many years and I'll
give you one answer I don't have the personality for it I can't I can't mince
words I don't have the patience to sit politely with my hands folded and say
mm-hmm mm-hmm I don't want to do any fundraising moreover I really don't want
to pander for votes I agree I absolutely got involved in some campaign stuff in
the begging for money and the questionnaires and the and just all the
weirdness and the sycophants that worship the political class totally sick
now you've talked a lot about this the 2 billion bullets I want to specifically
get into that the domestic drones the Homeland Security training I mean that
has captured the public's attention that the military-industrial complex is being
converted over as a system to control us I think that's something they're really
scared of us covering that well it's obvious what they're doing they're
drying up the supply of ammunition if they couldn't control the guns what
they're doing is controlling the ammo supply that's very obvious I had an
expert on the Michael Savage show last week who called it from WMAL in
Washington he said he's a he's a he's a manufacturer of weapons and bullets and
he said that's exactly what they're doing not only you don't know this Alex
but not only did they buy all of the available ammo they've put in advance
orders to give them priority for any ammo that's manufactured in the future
what they've done is completely dry up the supply they're very clever don't
ever underestimate your enemy Alex I agree if they are very clever they're
very angry they're very frightened and that makes for very dangerous enemy so
they can't get you on the Second Amendment so they cleverly said okay so
we can't take the guns away from the cracker let's take the bullets away from
the cracker that's what they're doing here Alex and that's exactly what needs
to be exposed to the general public you said this about three years ago and
after you said it there was a Financial Times of London article official
Democratic Party fundraiser letter to the millionaires that said don't worry
even he's gonna get reelected and there's gonna be big events that help
Obama take over there's gonna be crises and we're gonna blame it on the right
wing radio now you said that before they even came out and said it I've been
saying that what about the false flag Reichstag event Michael Savage I see
that as basically all the cornered rats have left stage stuff or let stuff
happen and blame it on us well there are people who are saying that these recent
shootings from Sandy Hook onward were staged by the government in some way I
can't accept that as a reality I don't know how they could brainwash that
idiot Lanza to go kill innocent school children sorry I'm sorry I'm go right
down the list right to Donor are they all government brainwashed lunatics I
mean I don't know if you believe that I personally don't but it's interesting to
me as an epidemiologist that they all seem to come within a short period of
time isn't it I mean they've all occurred in a very short period of time
just as the gun grabbers have raised their rhetoric about taking away our
Second Amendment rights so yeah I mean it's easy to say it's fits but is it
true I don't know well a lot of it is they just I mean look at the Batman
shooter in Aurora where he gets DARPA funding and is protected and the
psychiatrist is top Air Force assigned to him I mean even the police in LA
said Sirhan Sirhan wasn't the shooter of RFK and you know about amnesiac drugs
dr. Savage I really don't know that side of it you're so more deep so much more
deeply involved in this whole side of things that I am Alex I don't think we
need to even go there to understand that the enemy of our freedoms exists it's
real it has names regardless they're using the crisis to take our liberties
like Rahm Emanuel said well that's right but why would they let a crisis go to
waste

resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
again thank you for joining us on this worldwide Sunday edition the third day
of March 2013 hard to believe we're already into 2013 and the broadcast is
exploding in the face of the bizarre tyranny we're seeing but that's not
enough I don't want to just have a popular radio show folks this isn't a
game or an act Howard Stern last week was asking me is this an act no I really
am passionate I really am upset over secret testing on the public that's been
declassified where this government for 80 years has killed tens of thousands of
Americans military black white old young foster children in secret test that gets
to me that upsets me that makes me want to get justice not just so the evil are
punished but so that the good are protected let me tell you something
nationwide as you just heard in that obsolete man back from the 60s socialist
communist fascist systems say you are obsolete and we're now being told by the
globalists were obsolete because of computers and robots and all the rest of
this and I don't want to just punish the guilty I want to protect the innocent
and and move forward into a better world in the future and that's what I'm
talking about here today and I'm gonna be covering this more next week and I
know Mike Adams is gonna be sitting in one day and so is Aaron Dykes I'm gonna
take some time off with the family but I'm gonna be shooting some videos about
this as well all over the country and all over the world they are moving with
forced inoculations for decades they said it was the law and lied about it
ran hoaxes about it now they're actually trying to pass laws where they can get
your kid to sign a form and they can give consent well that was the case
again children could sign contracts to buy cars children could have sex with
adults children could you know go by firearms ten-year-olds could join the
military you every culture doesn't give children consent this is so over the top
show in the face and as the state trying to take over children they passed this
last year in California it's passed in other states are trying to pass it in
Texas now check your stakes it's in a bunch of them SB 64 is to make all
anybody that works around children public schools YMCA toddlers take all
these deadly vaccines that don't even protect you and actually spread the
disease in many cases and now they're pushing pregnant women to take tetanus
shots it's known to cause them to have miscarriages and then there's SB 63 the
really big one where child may consent to the child's own immunization of the
child in Part D a health care provider or facility may rely on the written
statement of the child containing the grounds of which the child has the
capacity consent the child's immunization under this section
unbelievable I mean this is beyond outrageous but the globalist are bum
rushing us on a thousand fronts with all this tyranny so we just give up and
going to learn helplessness or some baloney Stockholm syndrome where we love
our abusers well I don't love our abusers I want to win the future I want
the good guys to stand up and take action and that's what this broadcast

ladies and gentlemen I am extremely excited to have the one the only Ted
Nugent joining us in a powerhouse interview and the reason I know it's
gonna be a powerhouse I had a chance to have him call in to the Sunday weekend
show listening right here in Central Texas as he was driving and then I had a
chance to talk to him off-air about some of the other topics he wanted to come on
air and talk about so a lot of this is gonna be news breaking his new term the
black power tour is celebrating the fathers of rock and roll incredible
black Americans and they're demonizing that in the media I mean there's nothing
that Ted Nugent can't do right because he's pro Liberty and the Marxist
Decepticons are out there trying to divide and conquer this country we're
gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about how he's been persecuted by the
feds we're gonna talk about how he's got one of the most popular ammo lines in
the country we're gonna talk most importantly about taking America back
we've got him for the full hour you want Ted Nugent I had to do some serious
begging but we've got him uncle Ted great to have you back with us wow where
should we start you heard some of the topics I threw out well where should we
begin let's talk about your big rock and roll tour coming up and the media trying
to a lot of people my band won the Battle of the Bands we actually opened
up for the Supremes and the boat troubles with the brand-new Cobo Hall
back in 1962 or 63 Wow you know I just don't have any white musical influences
I thought Pat Boone was weird and I thought little Richard was God you know
what I mean I mean my music has a life of its own really after 50 years of
touring the audiences still are so intense and passionate and high energy
and let's let's morph into when I discovered the culture war you know this
this tour is called Ted Nugent black power 2013 because I'm bringing forth
the celebration that there really is a black thing and the black thing that
inspired me from the very beginning was James Brown's work ethic little
Richards work ethic Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley's their work ethic you can't
become the fathers the gods of thunder of rhythm and blues and rock and roll
unless you really put your nose to the grindstone and you work your ass off my
dad and mom forced us kids to do that that was the battle cry of the American
dream in the 1950s and 1960s until they until the beatniks turned into the
drooling puking idiot hippies and I was always attacked in the media even the
beginning when I was just a teenager because I I was a hunter because I ate
venison and I carried a gun and I believed in self-defense and this new
curse of leftism this Mao Tse tongue ugliness was metastasizing across
America so at first Alex when I did these interviews and they would attack
me because I spent the weekend at the shooting range with my dad or I spent
the weekend with my family up north deer hunting I like squinted and furrowed my
brow and went wait a minute you're condemning what is obviously perfect
self-defense is perfect so you woke up early on just because you were being
yourself and being demonized and it's so incredibly simple that that this country
was founded on the Second Amendment but they try to act like it's so incredibly
alien I'm tired of calling them liberals or even leftists even though that's as
they're known these are as you said Maoist these are hardcore authoritarian
pigs who know they're authoritarian pigs they're not environmentalists wackos
they're not ignorant they're not stupid they're criminals that want to run our
lives and make us their slaves I couldn't have said it better they really
are criminals I don't care if it's a Hillary Clinton refusing to provide
security on the anniversary of 9-11 the most dangerous areas in the world and
then getting upset because we asked her why or that the Attorney General is
running guns to Mexican drug gangs than trying to blame mom-and-pop gun shops
further for the criminality of his directive and his program it really is
like I don't know if it's one flew over the cuckoo's nest and Soylent Green or
Planet of the Apes and the insanity running amok in this country right now
can only be described as evil people with an evil agenda I am sick and tired
I figured like way back in the 1970s when people go well they're well
intentioned but they're misinformed that's not true at all their intentions
are evil and they know exactly what we're doing may I quote Nancy you don't
have to read this you need to sign it Pelosi yes you get any more anti-american
and anti-constitution anti we the people than that insanity no you can't and I
apologize for interrupting you and getting you off into the tyrants I just
want to you have are so prominent and know so many other prominent people I
think it's time to start a campaign to say we're really the Liberals Thomas
Jefferson was a liberal saying more freedom George Washington was a liberal
meaning more freedom I think they've stolen the term liberal or or even
progressive saying let's build our country up it's time to call them what
they are a cult a gang of criminals that want a managed organized economy
controlled by them and their cronies and that they have basically occupied this
country and there's no living with them we either take this country back and win
the war or we're going to be slaves no more win the battles and just let the
enemy keep launching attacks it's time to go on the total offense as the gun
manufacturers are doing as you're doing as I'm doing that's why they're scared
of us let's talk about Ted Nugent taking America and then the world back how do
we get on the offense and do you agree there's no more quarter they're not
giving us quarter we either take it all back or we're gonna lose
people are unaware that in the Rolling Stone cover stories on the cover of
Rolling Stone with a Wal-Mart PPK that I actually had on me in New York City
during the photo shoot celebrating the Second Amendment for the entire front
page feature story in Rolling Stone magazine in 1978 if you go back to my
interviews in 1968 1965 I have always promoted and celebrated never defended
the obvious and unambiguous right to keep and bear arms I have been on the
front line that's why the left in the medium what you could wear you're
accurately identifying is the cult of denial when you have a Valerie Jarrett
who is the communications are for the president who actually publicly quotes
mouth say tongue are you kidding me so I have been on the front line so the
answer to the big question how do we take our country back how do we get on
the offensive all you have to do is study what you and I do study what I've
done since the 1960s you'll never apologize you take the face-to-face
hand-to-hand close-quarter combat with the evidence from history that when
there's power abuse like President Obama and Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton and
all the SARS and all his communist buddies when they abuse the power and
they create such a depth of corruption if we don't communicate adamantly firmly
and politely but consistently with our elected officials every chance we get
which we have to make the opportunity every week and demand accountability
which hears it in a nutshell look in a person's eye do you believe that the
government can steal from families after-tax savings when mom or dad died
do you believe the government can steal after-tax savings from a family and that
that should be the law of the land because if the person says yes I believe
in it you're looking at the enemy of freedom the enemy America of America and
a thief if a person wants to get rid of the death test if you want to compromise
gun rights you're looking at the enemy no more compromise when I was on Capitol
Hill last week for the recently for the State of the Union address I shook every
Republican's hand and I wouldn't let go and I tried to shake it like chesty
puller looked him in the eye and went quick with the compromise we have compromised ourselves into a corner of communism. Cut it out!

coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
Broadcasting Network
I'm addicted to liberty
I will cross that Concord Bridge
It's the bridge to my destiny
Cause I'll pursue life
I'll pursue my happiness
Cause I'm so damn alive
I still believe
It feels like a crime to turn down a Ted Nugent song whenever I'm in the car
stranglehold probably one of the greatest if not the greatest
yeah I gotta ask you here before we get back into the news and some really hard
core stuff how did you come up with stranglehold I mean were you channeling
you know the almighty or something I mean that that is that song is so
perfect how did you do that Ted Nugent?
It is a powerful lick you should see it from where I'm sitting
when I play that lick every night my bands too Alex I've got to give a big
salute to the greasiest blackest gods of thunder in the world
Dick Brown on drums Greg Smith on bass guitar and Derek St. Holmes on
vocals and guitar I have every guitar player's dream every concert
every song every audience this year we're going on the tour and with Sticks
and Ariel Speedwagon we call the tour Ted Nugent Black Power because we're
inspired the stranglehold lick is a variation of all those black heroes
whether Bo Diddley Chuck Berry Little Richard James Brown Wilson Pickett Sam
and Dave Stax Bolt all things Motown and Funk Brothers there's a grind factor
that I was weaned on as a little kid in Detroit and when I pick up I could go
across the room right now and grab one of my guitars if they're all plugged
into amplifiers right now and I could just pick it up and whip out a lick that
would make you grind like an animal during the rut I have I've been cleaning
sober for 64 years and when you're cleaning sober you really tune in when
you get to jam with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and play with BB King are you
kidding me you pick up you kind of sponge the essence of that soul and
let's identify what that black music ultimately represented in its origins
defiance defiance against slavery defiance against oppression defiance
against your own black people tackling you and selling you as a slave that's
where that unbelievable James Brown work ethic came from they all rose up and
went yeah you think you could keep me down listen to this mother and I'm gonna
play some licks that everybody's gonna dance to and that's what we do to this
day so I'm very inspired by freedom that uppity black spirit of my original
inspirations and we pay homage to it every night on stage and I name them by
name and I've been doing it for 50 years and by the way you you mentioned this to
me earlier but I just punched it in black power Ted Nugent the media is
freaking out you've been saying this for 40-something years that this is what
inspires you your band all of it but the so-called left the tyrants who say you
don't like socialism don't like gun control it's racism has no connection to
reality not even any facts they just throw the word out there they're the
real race pimps Margaret Sanger saying we've got to become liberals and take
over to abort the black babies what do you say to the media freaking out over
your black power 2013 I mean from my research the so-called left are really
the proto Nazis the left in America and England created the eugenics that Hitler
picked up the truth is they claim that they're the anti-racist because they're
the racist well I think the biggest racist in the world would either be
President Obama I mean when you see Trayvon Martin could have been my son
well with all due respect mr. president Brian Terry could have been my son and
your Eric Holder sold the guns to the gangs that killed him try that
oversized Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson Louis Farrakhan number one cause of
black death in America not the not the subhuman Ku Klux Klan black Americans
kill black Americans on a weekly basis than the Klan ever did in a year it's
incredible and then and then you can't even have a tour paying homage to your
music roots it just shows shows how sick these people are they never want people
to really come together under freedom now expanding on this you mentioned the
fact that the NRA is getting on the offense when we have the memos that they
want to confiscate our guns when it's on record you use the truth to defeat them
and during the break we were talking you know you described as Republicans are
more worried about adjusting their tie than actually you know being Patriots
expand on that I mean look it's time to stop debating all their fake arguments
about the children they want our guns because they want a monopoly of power
and I think that's the key to the offense is pointing that out
well when I criticize the failures of the GOP I'm only the guilty need to feel
guilty we have some incredible leaders in this country right now especially
which is why I came to Texas ten years ago because the wonderful glorious work
at the center of Detroit that I grew up in turned in the hell zone of pimp's
horse and welfare brats because of liberal Democrats like mayor Coleman
young and mayor Kwame Patrick and Jennifer Granholm so I came to Texas
where we have genuine statesmen genuine Patriots who understand they serve we
the people in the US Constitution governor Perry is the best governor in
America Greg Abbott is the best attorney general in America Ron Paul Ted Cruz
John Cronin there's so many great great constitutional representatives here in
Texas in South Dakota Mike Rogers up in Michigan even Scott Walker now in
Wisconsin we see an improvement or return to the common sense exactly so
let me ask you this in their their guiding light that they have to make an
oath to to become elected officials match the US Constitution the Bill of
Rights so the once again I can't repeat this often enough so many people who
set their alarm clocks and bust their ass to be the best that they can be they
work they work they make ends meet they risk safe for a rainy day they demand
accountability and productivity by their sons and everybody in their family
that's how the Nugent family operates that's how the Alex Jones family
operates but a lot of those people don't vote a lot of those people don't
communicate they don't even know who their senator their congressman is so
we the people who want upgrade and return to a US constitutionally driven
America we have got to communicate with our elected officials because that some
of the elected officials that I just named by name there are some of those in
every state even California New Jersey in New York and Illinois they got these
people but they don't hear from us so until you are an actual participant in
the secret experiment self-government I'd like to thank you for nothing I
agree with you and and look at the areas like Chicago and LA and the areas that
these authoritarians that call themselves liberals are in control they
bankrupt and destroy every city every county every state every country they
run because they are con-artist criminals and again it's time for us to
stop apologizing about the fact that we're right it's time for us to stand up
and call these crooks out and that's why they say oh you're discredited yelling
appears Morgan or or Ted Nugent you know you know told him get off people's backs
and shut the hell up and you know that you're basically full of crap Oh Ted's
discredited no we're the only people waking people up out of their coma and
the fact that the so-called left is saying don't get angry that shows
they're scared of us getting angry I've been in every media I do media every day
and anybody that has ever messed with me has lost because I have all the evidence
to support what I stand for because I stand for the self-evident truth and
being the best that you can be

Jones Broadcasting Network Network
Ted Nugent joins us Ted Nugent.com if you're just now
tweeting in again I'm Alex Jones with mfallwars.com Ted where do you think
America will be if people don't stand up and don't take action which is starting
to happen but if people don't stand up and really get in the face of this
tyranny and back it off because by getting aggressive politically with the
First Amendment we won't have to use the second but what is your concern because
again as I said earlier I had Ron Paul on a few days ago and he's concerned
about civil war it appears to a lot of sociologists and people that study this
that the leftists want to start some type of conflict and then brand the
Patriots as the Homeland Security documents under Obama's state that
al-qaeda is not the threat now it's gun owners conservatives returning veterans
they're clearly trying to brand it a article came out yesterday where
Homeland Security is buying drones and in the training video they're they're
going around looking for people selling guns to their neighbors so we see that
the Patriot American is the new target of Homeland Security what can you say
about that and how it segues into some of the persecution you've gone through
tell us tell us what's been happening to you the last few months
well there's so many issues there number one thank you for bringing these things
up because now people can Google and they go to your website and if you go to
Ted Nugent.com I would welcome you I would love to have you part of our Ted
Nugent.com talkback we have some hardcore gung-ho great American families on my
talkback on my website and we get all this latest update too and we make sure
that we review it we got people inside the deepest security in the United
States government that are on my talkback we have friends in most federal
agencies and in every department of every political activity in every state
and we're looking with a genuine spirit of concern and a genuine duty to
participate as we the people to ask questions and demand answers and we got
this far down there down the totem pole we've gotten this bad off and we've been
abused and the the corruption has gotten this outrageous because so many
Americans were disengaged they bent over and they couldn't believe that a
government would hurt someone I'll never forget the interview with the lady who
was in Rwanda checking out some gorillas or something and I mean they're the real
gorillas not the guerrilla fighters the gorillas in the mist and she was crying
because the gangsters in Rwanda who had attacked their bus and killed everybody
she actually went I can't believe that a human being would intentionally hurt
another human being. It's so naive. That kind of brain dead soullessness has
horribly taken place and taken root and metastasized here in America so I know
about the drones I know about the militarization of law enforcement but
I'm not gonna guess what might happen if Obama's dream of tyranny comes true I
believe that more and more people are waking up I believe that more and more
people are communicating these serious issues about accountability and what
happened in Benghazi and Fast and Furious the crime of Obamacare the abuse
of power and the corruption the absolute proven lies of every word out of this
president's mouth at the last State of the Union address I believe that we are
going to vote these bastards out that we're going to demand accountability
like they did in the ultra liberal hell zone of Michigan with the governor Rick
Snyder now we've got a Republican he's not a conservative but he's way better
than Jennifer Granholm Scott Walker huge upgrade in Wisconsin I travel and I
still rock and roll and my tour will take me to every state in every major
city across America again 50 years in a row now and when I communicate with
people Alex I'm here to bring great great upgrade to your attention people
are waking up and we are going to take this country back at the voting booth
that's how we're going to do it well listen I'm not bragging about this when
I tell these stories it's because it's important for people to know I could now
go anywhere in the country and can't walk 10 feet down a street without
listeners stopping and I'm just you know a little guy in all this and I went to a
restaurant in Wimberley Texas Saturday and there were only about 10 tables and
almost every table came over and wanted photos and we're listeners and I know
you get the same response it's what you're saying it's exponential how many
people are awake of every race color and creed it's exciting and I think the key
to all this is saying look they want our guns to enslave us they're liars they're
tyrants just calling it like it is people are so hungry for that and we just go
past the hoax that oh we're supposed to stand down and compromise the other side
never gives in they just tell us to compromise then as you said we bend over
but let's talk about this I talked to you off air when you called in on the
Sunday show you said oh man next time I come on I'll tell you about the crap
I've been going through I think it's important to talk about how they spun
what you said some of the things you know that have happened to you and how
they're trying to go after you because if they can take down Ted Nugent somebody
who's actually alive whose heart is beating and if they can demonize that if
we don't stand behind Ted Nugent even if people don't a hundred percent agree
with you out there they've got to stand behind you in the First Amendment because
if they can take you down kind of the guy up there on the point I mean little
Second Amendment you think of Ted Nugent and George Washington and then down the
road maybe Alex Jones and Ron Paul and the NRA but I mean let's say you're Mr.
Second Amendment I mean buddy I know you got the Second Amendment but I hope you
got bodyguards you really are front and center have you realized that yes I have
over the years I realized that when it comes to absolutely defining the God
given right to keep and bear arms I've been on the forefront forever and now
people are realizing that the reason I'm considered an extremist to sell it is
because the concept of having a free people was very extreme in 1775 yeah the
system demonizes the founders the system demonizes the founders so I'm saying
you're Mr. Second Amendment tell us about the persecution well you know I've
been a hunter my whole life my dad raised me to be law-abiding I've been a
sheriff deputy for over 30 34 years now I conduct federal raids here in Texas
with the FBI the ATF the DEA the Texas Rangers and the federal marshals I've
been I've been very active hands-on in law enforcement for over 30 years now my
point being is that you don't become a sheriff deputy you're not invited on the
federal you know fugitive felony raids if you're a questionable guy you have to
prove yourself and I proved myself during my training and I've proven
myself during these raids well I'm solidly in the asset column but I've
always been a legal hunter my dad said you don't dare break a law I've never
hunted out of season with the wrong weapon I've always bought every tag and
every license and every permit and really watched my P's and Q's well a
number of years ago I was hunting in California our Ted Nugent spiritual wild
show on outdoor channel had been the number one show an outdoor hunting show
for over 26 years now every year we become the viewers favorite because I do
it honestly I do a documentary to style real down-to-earth natural or
organic killing your own food I don't play games I don't apologize well the US
Fish and Wildlife Service has been so infested with anti hunting anti wildlife
anti Ted Nugent idiots that in California hunting an apple orchard on
our TV show on spirit of the wild we showed it on the air I had bought my
licenses and double-checked all the legalities with the director of
California Fish and Game James Fong long story short after the show aired US
Fish and Wildlife jackbooted thugs subhuman punks had a 36 man guns drawn
pre-dawn raid on my three hunting buddies homes in California based on the
allegation equal to a jaywalking ticket that I was hunting over bait Alex they
kicked down doors they confiscated guns and bows and video cameras and
telephones and computers photographs they abused these poor families 100%
law-abiding never broke a law in their lives
upstanding members of the community and then they ran and they tried to charge
me with felonies claiming that somehow in the apple orchard I had placed a bait
which they did all kinds of forensic soil sample tests and they came up with
nothing but because the allegations were such a scam it was such a trumped up
railroad a witch hunt that the attorneys in California said I could beat it no
question but it would cost me between a quarter and a half million dollars and
remember a jackbooted 36 man guns drawn pre-dawn raid based on a jaywalking
ticket it just shows what crazy authoritarians they are and how they use
regulations to harass people but then exempt themselves when Obama's given a
half billion dollars to his buddies to a fake energy company
