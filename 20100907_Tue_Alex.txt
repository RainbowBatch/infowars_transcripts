[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:24.280]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.280 --> 00:31.440]  This is the Alex Jones show on Tuesday, the 7th of September, 2010. My name's Paul Joseph
[00:31.440 --> 00:37.120]  Watson, filling in for Alex, who's away at the moment working on a project with Jesse
[00:37.120 --> 00:43.960]  Ventura, the former governor in the Gulf of Mexico. I'll be filling in for Alex today,
[00:43.960 --> 00:51.520]  and I'm, as most of you know, the writer and editor for Alex's website, prisonplanet.com.
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.120]  And stay tuned today, because in the second hour, we've got Bob Chapman, veteran stockbroker,
[00:57.120 --> 01:02.360]  economist, and at one time, of course, one of the biggest gold and silver traders in
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.480]  the world. And Bob will be joining us to talk about the deepening double-dip recession,
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.880]  the worsening unemployment picture, and of course, what we can all do to prepare financially
[01:15.880 --> 01:22.640]  for what's coming down the pipeline. And Bob joins us in the second hour. But first,
[01:22.640 --> 01:27.720]  I want to talk to you about a subject which we've constantly covered on the Alex Jones
[01:27.720 --> 01:37.200]  show. It was at the forefront of Alex's documentary in 2006, Endgame. And of course, that subject
[01:37.200 --> 01:44.400]  is eugenics, the notion that our scientific elites should be empowered with the divine
[01:44.400 --> 01:52.600]  right to rule over life and death. And of course, this discussion shot back into the
[01:52.600 --> 01:59.040]  news last week, where we had the story out of Maryland with this crazed gunman, James
[01:59.040 --> 02:08.040]  J. Lee, who was inspired by Al Gore's global warming documentary, An Inconvenient Truth,
[02:08.040 --> 02:14.160]  who went into the Discovery Channel building in downtown Silver Spring, explosives strapped
[02:14.160 --> 02:21.360]  to his chest, guns, and he took these hostages, the police ended up killing him. Now, of course,
[02:21.360 --> 02:29.120]  many of you then read Lee's online screed, which was posted on PrismPlanet.com, which
[02:29.120 --> 02:36.520]  explained the motivation behind why he did what he did. And of course, his motivation
[02:36.520 --> 02:44.160]  was global warming overpopulation. He had bought into the brainwashing the myth that
[02:44.160 --> 02:51.360]  is eugenics that's being promoted on a top down basis to everyone in the world right
[02:51.360 --> 02:57.600]  now. And that's what led to his attempted massacre. Thankfully, he didn't kill anybody.
[02:57.600 --> 03:03.640]  Now Alex Jones has documented the origins of eugenics in his film, Endgame, from, you
[03:03.640 --> 03:10.680]  know, Malthus to Hitler to Galton Institute from Britain through America and into the
[03:10.680 --> 03:17.280]  70s when sterilization was finally outlawed in America. But I want to talk to you today
[03:17.280 --> 03:26.040]  about the origins and the motivations behind neo eugenics, which is the thinly veiled doctrine
[03:26.040 --> 03:34.080]  of overpopulation and manmade global warming. That's what neo eugenics is disguised behind
[03:34.080 --> 03:40.120]  in today's world. And more specifically, I want to talk to you about how we've been
[03:40.120 --> 03:48.240]  bathed, inoculated and induced into this, what I describe in my article today on PrismPlanet.com
[03:48.240 --> 03:56.920]  as a religion of death. This widespread belief, and it is shockingly widespread, that humans
[03:56.920 --> 04:03.520]  should be sterilized or indeed killed in large numbers in the name of saving the planet from
[04:03.520 --> 04:10.720]  environmental destruction. And it's a belief that's now becoming so widespread that people
[04:10.720 --> 04:18.200]  like James J Lee are starting to act on it with violence. And of course, we read the
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.040]  horrible story out of Argentina a few months ago, where the parents were involved in a
[04:23.040 --> 04:30.080]  suicide pact and actually killed their own son, as well as shooting their own baby before
[04:30.080 --> 04:36.560]  killing themselves in homage to global warming. So we're going to explore this religion of
[04:36.560 --> 04:59.760]  death and how it threatens us all after the break on the Alex Jones show. Stay tuned.
[04:59.760 --> 05:04.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.080]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.080 --> 05:18.160]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.800]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[05:22.800 --> 05:28.440]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:28.440 --> 05:32.760]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.880]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.520]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[08:04.240 --> 08:15.200]  behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[08:15.200 --> 08:20.680]  It's the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, September 7th. All Joseph Watson filling in
[08:20.680 --> 08:28.560]  for Alex Jones. And we're talking about Neo eugenics and manmade global warming. The inspiration
[08:28.560 --> 08:34.720]  behind James J. Lee's attempted rampage last week when he entered the Discovery Channel
[08:34.720 --> 08:43.440]  building with explosives and guns. Now we were just starting to get into how the Neo eugenics
[08:43.440 --> 08:51.360]  agenda manifests itself in the modern day era. And it's amazing to me to think that even
[08:51.360 --> 08:56.960]  in the aftermath of climate gate, you know, of hide the decline of Amazon gate of the
[08:56.960 --> 09:04.880]  admitted fact that the IPCC now admits that they just make up the numbers to fit the doctrine.
[09:04.880 --> 09:11.920]  Pichowry now admits that on the record that people still trust the same environmentalists
[09:11.920 --> 09:17.480]  that are coming out with the overpopulation rhetoric, even when they've been caught lying
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.920]  at every juncture about global warming, about manmade climate change. And now those same
[09:23.920 --> 09:28.720]  people are saying that the world is drastically overpopulated and we need to do something
[09:28.720 --> 09:36.440]  about it fast and we need to do something drastic about it. And indeed, it's amazing
[09:36.440 --> 09:42.840]  just how many people are still brainwashed even though now the majority know that global
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.240]  warming, that manmade global warming is a fraud. Still vast amounts of people believe
[09:49.240 --> 09:56.120]  in this myth of overpopulation. And I want to destroy that today because it's one of
[09:56.120 --> 10:03.200]  the biggest myths out there. It's propagated by liars who have no interest in the environment
[10:03.200 --> 10:11.520]  but who have one sole interest in citing overpopulation as a means through which they can control
[10:11.520 --> 10:20.640]  your lives with draconian population reduction measures. Now, overpopulation is a myth. I
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.600]  don't care, you know, what your tutor told you, what your professor told you, what you
[10:26.600 --> 10:33.640]  read out of, you know, Al Gore's books. It's documented the global fertility rate has been
[10:33.640 --> 10:40.040]  falling since the 50s. That's a fact. That's the UN's own numbers. Not least because of
[10:40.040 --> 10:48.160]  all these gender-bending, you know, endocrine disruptors in our food and water, the vaccines.
[10:48.160 --> 10:53.240]  We got the documents just last week from the Rockefeller Institute about putting sterilents
[10:53.240 --> 10:59.880]  in vaccines. This was in the 60s. This was in their own documents. The soft-kill weapons
[10:59.880 --> 11:07.760]  that the elite have launched against us, which are all now becoming public, by Sphenol A.
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.800]  And in fact, the Rockefellers worked with the World Health Organization to introduce
[11:11.800 --> 11:22.080]  that global vaccine program, which was focused around sterilizing people. So now we see fertility
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.560]  across the world falling at dramatic rates. In Brazil, in Indonesia, even in parts of
[11:28.560 --> 11:34.760]  India and other areas of the third world, fertility is falling so fast that it's already
[11:34.760 --> 11:44.120]  reached around 2.1, which is just at the replacement rate to replace humanity, 2 for 2. And in
[11:44.120 --> 11:50.600]  many European countries, it's below that. So in fact, the population of Europe is literally
[11:50.600 --> 11:57.760]  dying out. This is why Russia and other governments have to beg their populations to have children
[11:57.760 --> 12:03.480]  because they're dying out. And it's going to be an economic wasteland if the amount
[12:03.480 --> 12:10.720]  of people in Europe continue to decline. So across the whole world, the UN's own figures
[12:10.720 --> 12:19.600]  state that population, that the fertility rate will sink to 2.1 by 2050. So as soon
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.480]  as we get to 2050, population starts to decline. Overpopulation is not a problem. The only
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.280]  problem that will exist is underpopulation after 2050. And that's going to be a major
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.920]  issue for future generations. And even though these figures proving that population, that
[12:39.920 --> 12:46.800]  overpopulation is a myth, come from the UN, those very same people who work for the UN
[12:46.800 --> 12:56.000]  under the IPCC will then kick and scream about how we need this planetary regime in the words
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.440]  of John P. Holdren, White House science star, to enact these draconian population control
[13:02.440 --> 13:10.920]  measures in order to save the Earth. Alex has exhaustively documented Ecoscience Holdren's
[13:10.920 --> 13:20.360]  1977 textbook, which talks about these horrific measures of forced sterilization, forced abortion,
[13:20.360 --> 13:27.160]  one child policy. And this guy is now in the White House. He's Obama's science star. And
[13:27.160 --> 13:33.560]  he's at these global conferences talking about geoengineering the planet. And it's no wonder
[13:33.560 --> 13:39.800]  that we see all these chemtrails now. We see the pollution of our water supply. We see
[13:39.800 --> 13:45.800]  real environmental issues being ignored and in fact pushed by the elite as part of this
[13:45.800 --> 13:51.700]  population reduction agenda. Meanwhile, a fear monger about overpopulation, when their
[13:51.700 --> 13:59.720]  own figures prove that by 2050, world population will start to decline and it will continue
[13:59.720 --> 14:10.720]  to decline.
