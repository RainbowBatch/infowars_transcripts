[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.280 --> 00:41.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:41.400 --> 00:48.400]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to another global transmission against tyranny.
[00:48.400 --> 00:56.520]  I am your host, Alex Jones. The date, of course, is the 30th of January, 2012. And we're going
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.360]  to be here live for the next three hours. Then we'll be back this evening, seven o'clock
[01:02.360 --> 01:08.680]  central, with InfoWars Nightly News, of course, at infowarsnews.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08.680 --> 01:17.880]  Okay, here is the conundrum, or the pickle, or the dilemma. I've got to cover all the
[01:17.880 --> 01:21.880]  news. It's just all off the charts, getting more insane by the minute, confirming all
[01:21.880 --> 01:26.880]  of our analysis about the globalists and their plans. From police state to censorship to
[01:26.880 --> 01:33.360]  massive taxation, with a cashless society being used to absolutely rape everyone and
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.040]  destroy the economy by design while they do it.
[01:37.040 --> 01:41.000]  Once they put the cashless system in place completely, you think five bucks to use your
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.680]  ATM's gonna be bad? There's gonna be all these global taxes, you name it. We're already seeing
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.880]  it in Europe under the engineered austerity that we told you in 99 was coming, once they
[01:52.880 --> 01:55.320]  imploded the derivative scandal.
[01:55.320 --> 02:01.060]  We predicted right around 2011, 2012, because it's all a plan. You can see the progression
[02:01.060 --> 02:04.800]  of it. And there's not even really dots to connect. It's like one of those connect the
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.000]  dots you give a three year old, where the numbers are right beside each other. And you
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.560]  can see that it's a dinosaur, or you can see that it's a parakeet.
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.940]  You can see it's a horse, a monkey, a kitty cat. I mean, you don't even need to connect
[02:18.940 --> 02:26.040]  the dots. I mean, it's like a jigsaw puzzle that's got 500 pieces, and 495 of them are
[02:26.040 --> 02:33.280]  in place. There's five more little pieces to stick in. I mean, it's not hard, not hard.
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.920]  Get out of your unconscious and still believe the old propaganda that there's no global
[02:37.920 --> 02:38.920]  elite.
[02:38.920 --> 02:45.480]  There's no special insider interest. There's nothing corrupt going on. Just trust the nice
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.720]  people that run the government and the big corporations that have bought and paid for
[02:50.720 --> 03:01.340]  them. Never mind, everything is just so wonderful. And then the system sits there with bought
[03:01.340 --> 03:06.600]  and paid for prostitute, prostitute media, pointing at those of us that are awake and
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.600]  live in the real world.
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.520]  And go, ha ha ha, they think there's a corrupt government and a global corporate government
[03:11.520 --> 03:14.960]  being set up. When it's in all the admitted documents, world leaders are all admitting
[03:14.960 --> 03:20.760]  it. They're like, ha ha, look, they're reporting on absolute admitted facts, ha ha ha. And
[03:20.760 --> 03:28.520]  they count on people being so into trendiness, so into peer pressure that they laugh at us.
[03:28.520 --> 03:34.560]  It still happens, not as much as it used to. Instead, a lot of people now aren't laughing.
[03:34.560 --> 03:39.360]  They're going, okay, you're right about this. What do we do? We don't have any power. Ladies
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.080]  and gentlemen, they wouldn't be setting up this police state and openly trying to censor
[03:43.080 --> 03:44.080]  the Internet.
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.040]  And I got some really bad news on the Internet front. I mean, this is moving quicker than
[03:48.040 --> 03:54.080]  I thought. You think we dodged a bullet on SOPA? That's like if you got a firing squad
[03:54.080 --> 04:00.000]  of 20 guys in front of you all aiming 30 odd sixes at you at 10 yards away, and one idiot
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.180]  misfires and misses you.
[04:04.180 --> 04:10.160]  And as I said, it's because the global corporations, they want the decisions and entreaties that
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.400]  private corporations are signing on to with governments. They want to be the enforcers,
[04:15.400 --> 04:21.280]  not government. We're entering this phase now where the extreme privatization is nothing
[04:21.280 --> 04:26.680]  but government signing government powers illegally over to mega corporations.
[04:26.680 --> 04:34.120]  Remember, of the 100 biggest economies, more than half of them are corporations. Of the
[04:34.120 --> 04:41.200]  one, look it up, of the 100 biggest economies, how do you look it up? Put it in an NSA crystal
[04:41.200 --> 04:49.720]  ball Google system. That's what it is. Put the info in. You'll see them saying it. Of
[04:49.720 --> 04:55.040]  the 100 biggest economies, 50 plus. A couple years ago it was like 51 that we've crossed
[04:55.040 --> 05:01.680]  that Rubicon of corporations. They got their own armies, spies, hit teams.
[05:01.680 --> 05:06.400]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[05:06.400 --> 05:11.740]  opportunity, and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Cow Bin Pure Soap Company
[05:11.740 --> 05:16.080]  can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are
[05:16.080 --> 05:21.080]  triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable
[05:21.080 --> 05:27.400]  and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials. Your
[05:27.400 --> 05:33.640]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.540]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never
[05:37.540 --> 05:41.480]  had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[06:01.920 --> 06:06.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[06:06.440 --> 06:11.920]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[06:11.920 --> 06:16.920]  from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our President and
[06:16.920 --> 06:23.400]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:23.400 --> 06:28.720]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The
[06:28.720 --> 06:34.280]  criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[06:34.280 --> 06:38.320]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.440]  matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like
[06:42.440 --> 06:49.040]  nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get
[06:49.040 --> 06:55.600]  your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[07:18.080 --> 07:23.760]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control? The fact is in all this
[07:23.760 --> 07:29.960]  craziness there's only one thing you can control, your greatest dependency, your food supply.

[08:04.200 --> 08:11.120]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio
[08:11.120 --> 08:28.800]  Network. Okay, we're going to have Dr. Kathryn Albrecht joining us. She's a of course journalist
[08:28.800 --> 08:35.360]  as well, who for a long time has been reporting on the surveillance police state grid.
[08:35.360 --> 08:42.600]  She's going to be joining us in the third hour today to talk about Google's new user
[08:42.600 --> 08:47.760]  policies where they admit that basically everything you do is going to be tracked and going to
[08:47.760 --> 08:55.560]  be used and going to be tied together from all Google platforms. From Google smartphones,
[08:55.560 --> 09:02.240]  the droids, right through to your searches, to where you shop online, to your habits,
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.740]  to the movies you're purchasing. Your psychological profile will be integrated in to their social
[09:07.740 --> 09:09.280]  network systems.
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.480]  It'll be integrated into YouTube and all of it cross referenced, popping up, tailor made
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.800]  ads but also telling your friends and family where you've been shopping, what you've been
[09:19.800 --> 09:24.680]  doing, saying, hey, Bob went here, Bob did this. Do you think you'll like what Bob's
[09:24.680 --> 09:30.200]  doing? That's the incredible creepiness that Facebook's had, of course, for several years
[09:30.200 --> 09:35.440]  now where when you want to log in to your own account, they say, here's this individual
[09:35.440 --> 09:38.400]  from your high school.
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.960]  Confirm that this is the person from your high school. This happened to Darren McBreen
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.840]  on his Facebook, it's happened to us on our official Facebook. And you're there, you can't
[09:46.840 --> 09:53.640]  even remember, you're like, yeah, I vaguely remember that name and that person but I mean,
[09:53.640 --> 09:59.080]  they're an adult now. I can't really, it's wanting you to ping that data so they can
[09:59.080 --> 10:06.580]  have humet or human intelligence with the AI interface to know if that is indeed someone
[10:06.580 --> 10:08.700]  that you knew in high school.
[10:08.700 --> 10:13.320]  And then you think that you're just proving to it that you're really logging into your
[10:13.320 --> 10:20.320]  Facebook. And they build these big maps with it, it is beyond ultra creepy. And on the
[10:20.320 --> 10:26.960]  internet takeover front, remember the washers, the dryers, the entertainment centers, your
[10:26.960 --> 10:36.480]  television, the household appliances, especially the refrigerator, almost all of the new ones,
[10:36.480 --> 10:40.600]  and this is global standardization.
[10:40.600 --> 10:44.160]  Corporations actually tell the government globally, the governments, they have big meetings,
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.180]  how to standardize what systems to go with. And they have debates about it and things.
[10:49.180 --> 10:54.240]  And sometimes you'll see something like Blu-ray versus HD disc, and there'll be a fight between
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.520]  two global companies and then one comes out on top like Blu-ray. But generally it's globally
[10:59.520 --> 11:06.000]  standardized and back doors are built in under regulation and in some countries under law.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.040]  Where your cell phone tracks you, where they can dial in and listen to you even when your
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.080]  phone's turned off, that was put into regulatory law in 1996.
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.660]  I know I belabor that point, it's just this stuff is so standardized. Take India, they
[11:19.660 --> 11:26.080]  just passed a new internet ID law by executive order. They couldn't get the parliament to
[11:26.080 --> 11:30.460]  do it. But I saw an article over the weekend where the government just signed an executive
[11:30.460 --> 11:37.720]  order where you're going to thumbprint and face scan to be able to connect to the internet.
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.760]  And then if they ever say you've done something wrong, no judge, no jury under these international
[11:42.760 --> 11:45.560]  treaties, you are now just banned.
[11:45.560 --> 11:51.560]  You hold your smartphone to be able to get online, or your PC or whatever the case is,
[11:51.560 --> 12:00.720]  and it says sorry. And then somebody else logs on for you, they then get banned. I mean,
[12:00.720 --> 12:04.960]  this is the total control, and then everything's gonna be on these clouds.
[12:04.960 --> 12:10.140]  And so the globalist can put out one directive, and this is in all these treaties, and every
[12:10.140 --> 12:18.320]  website not authorized to quote have a certain song, no judge, no jury, no nothing. The song
[12:18.320 --> 12:25.320]  is erased off of the servers. And there's global standardization in the Cybersecurity
[12:25.320 --> 12:26.320]  Act.
[12:26.320 --> 12:31.160]  There was an article, a press release by Homeland Security last Friday we covered, put out
[12:31.160 --> 12:36.880]  by them saying Homeland Security at Davos gets agreement from other nations on global
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.360]  standardization of all commerce buying and selling. And they're gonna tie it to biometrics.
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.680]  And once the biometrics are in place, where you just walk into the store, you'll still
[12:48.680 --> 12:51.300]  swipe the card, still give the code.
[12:51.300 --> 12:58.360]  But the face scanning camera will authenticate that you're using the card, that you're engaged
[12:58.360 --> 13:06.720]  in it. Now, constantly you hear about murders, crimes, rapes, and the police never released
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.720]  the videos, or it's never recording at the time, and that's all lies. The system wants
[13:11.720 --> 13:17.040]  the crime. So they only selectively, I could take you with the town I live in, in Austin,
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.680]  to East 11th, all these places, I can show you crack dealers, prostitutes, no one stops
[13:21.680 --> 13:22.680]  them.
[13:22.680 --> 13:29.220]  Now, if you don't pay your cut to the criminal boss above you who's paying off city officials
[13:29.220 --> 13:35.920]  and government people, you'll get shut down. But the point is, it's all scripted. It's
[13:35.920 --> 13:47.720]  all organized crime. That case of the West Point grad, I guess he was, what was it, a
[13:47.720 --> 13:50.120]  captain over in Iraq?
[13:50.120 --> 14:00.920]  His name was a captain, honorably discharged. And we've had him in studio a few times. And
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.360]  it's on the news. The police say we're not gonna release our dash cam video because of
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.180]  our ongoing investigation. This is a guy sees a police officer jumping on and reportedly
[14:12.180 --> 14:15.680]  beating a woman at a 7-Eleven parking lot.
[14:15.680 --> 14:21.760]  He starts taking photos of it. He had an old phone, says he's gonna get a smartphone, a
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.480]  tracker phone. And he was taking photos at about 10 feet away, 15 feet away. He was there
[14:26.480 --> 14:32.540]  at the gas pump. This all starts in the gas pump next to him when they pull her over.
[14:32.540 --> 14:36.920]  They're beating up the woman out of the passenger seat. According to his report, another witness
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.800]  had just stepped forward. So the cops run over, he's got his hands up. He leans back
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.560]  from the police officer cuz they don't know somebody was videotaping across the street.
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.040]  Now, the cop had said that he'd assaulted him and stuff. But once that video came out,
[14:49.040 --> 14:54.320]  they said, well, he spit on us cuz they knew the video was shot at about 100 yards away.
[14:54.320 --> 15:00.560]  So you couldn't tell if he was spitting or not. So he spit on me. And now, of course,
[15:00.560 --> 15:07.680]  there's the cop car pulled up right there. The veteran's saying, release the video. And
[15:07.680 --> 15:11.000]  R.D. Cevita, the police chief says, no, I'm not going to.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.760]  And it's always the same, ladies and gentlemen. In Houston, they pulled over that former CIA
[15:16.760 --> 15:22.640]  section chief, Carnaby, who was reportedly a whistleblower. Wayne Madsen, investigative
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.760]  journalist, went down to Houston to investigate it. And the guy certainly was CIA on record,
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.320]  had all these awards. The media spun it and said he's not even CIA.
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.680]  But they get him out of the car, he doesn't resist, he's standing there and the cops execute
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.220]  him. And you know what, they won't release the squad car videos. They got the helicopter
[15:39.220 --> 15:47.920]  shot of him clear as day executing him. He was on the run, I guess, knew something he
[15:47.920 --> 15:48.920]  wasn't supposed to know.
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.680]  But they've got, especially on big departments like Houston, LA was the first to do it on
[15:53.680 --> 16:01.000]  record back in the 60s. They have hit teams in every police department, actual hit teams.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.480]  And a lot of times it's a quasi-mafia, but it's government approved. And when the gangs
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.560]  get out online or somebody doesn't pay them their cut, they just send cops to kill you.
[16:11.560 --> 16:17.840]  They're called the Vikings. I've actually met some of them, retired detectives, in Los
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.960]  Angeles. They just can do whatever they want.
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.760]  Police gangs, ladies and gentlemen, the Vikings, look them up. There have been famous incidents
[16:27.760 --> 16:32.420]  of them, executing people and doing a lot of things. And sometimes there's sub-gangs
[16:32.420 --> 16:40.160]  of cops, but then they always shut those down. So, I mean, I don't know if they have hit
[16:40.160 --> 16:45.360]  teams on the Austin Police Department, a lot of times they're unsanctioned, they're compartmentalized.
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.240]  It's admitted that all over the country, the CIA is now involved with police departments
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.200]  and the Threat Fusion Centers and recruiting. But they could just pull me over, or I go
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.880]  to the wrong town where they've got their guys.
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.080]  They could pull me over, shoot me, and just say, you know what, we're not releasing the
[16:58.080 --> 17:03.120]  squad car video, national security. They can say whatever they want. They could have me
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.800]  get on my knees, shoot me right in the back of the head, they could do it to you. They
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.640]  did it to Carnaby, get out of the car, he gets out, boom, you're dead.
[17:11.640 --> 17:17.000]  Oops, helicopter caught that, went out live, doesn't matter. You want close up video, we're
[17:17.000 --> 17:24.800]  not gonna release that. I love how they always talk about the veterans, the system does,
[17:24.800 --> 17:30.040]  about how much they love them, how much they care about them, how great they are.
[17:30.040 --> 17:40.080]  And I've got an article here. Police get help with confronting veterans, officer.com. And
[17:40.080 --> 17:48.260]  yeah, they're training for their number one enemy, returning military. Cuz these are people
[17:48.260 --> 17:55.060]  you just can't bully all day that'll actually break and respond. And the article actually
[17:55.060 --> 17:56.660]  says that more and more.
[17:56.660 --> 18:01.720]  The number one thing killing SWAT team members and others is trained military people. Yeah,
[18:01.720 --> 18:05.280]  they've actually been actually fighting men and people that are shooting back at them
[18:05.280 --> 18:09.880]  in some cases. It's not just raiding drug dealers that didn't pay their cut to you or
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.680]  whatever. And they're people that have already killed so many people and feel bad about it
[18:14.680 --> 18:16.760]  that they're ready to die.
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.200]  And so they're ready to sell their life for a bunch of you guys. What do you think's gonna
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.960]  happen as they try the gun confiscation they're training the military and police for? What
[18:26.960 --> 18:34.720]  is gonna happen when 1% of the 10 million plus veterans fight back against you? Total
[18:34.720 --> 18:41.600]  devastation. There's nothing you can do. Nothing the system can do. No amount of robots, drones,
[18:41.600 --> 18:42.600]  nothing will help you.
[18:42.600 --> 18:47.760]  And of course, the globalist have all this set up by design. They think they're gonna
[18:47.760 --> 18:53.160]  have some cutesy civil war. And out of this problem reaction solution, everything will
[18:53.160 --> 19:02.160]  break down and later will beg for total tyranny. I don't see that happening. And what's really
[19:02.160 --> 19:08.720]  creepy is in every place in the United States, every major city that we've spot checked,
[19:08.720 --> 19:10.840]  they're training for at least five years.
[19:10.840 --> 19:14.460]  The Explorer Scouts, we first learned about this from listeners, then it was the New York
[19:14.460 --> 19:19.840]  Times or their publications. They're training 14 and 15 year old boys to take on quote disgruntled
[19:19.840 --> 19:26.800]  veterans and kill them. People laugh, we got some 14 year olds. The first 14 year olds
[19:26.800 --> 19:35.420]  to be trained are now 19. The point is the criminals that have hijacked our government
[19:35.420 --> 19:39.760]  are training for absolute war against Americans.
[19:39.760 --> 19:44.080]  Now I'm gonna go through a bunch of news when we get back. Thailand backs Twitter censorship
[19:44.080 --> 19:52.120]  policy. This is all part of the new treaty. Internet censorship past and present. ACTA
[19:52.120 --> 19:56.240]  is worse than SOPA. Here's what you need to know about the global treaty. We'll break
[19:56.240 --> 19:59.840]  that down and a lot more straight ahead.
[19:59.840 --> 20:04.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid
[20:04.880 --> 20:09.720]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[20:09.720 --> 20:13.520]  non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true seeds have
[20:13.520 --> 20:17.020]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[20:17.020 --> 20:21.580]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[20:21.580 --> 20:27.780]  mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[20:27.780 --> 20:32.320]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[20:32.320 --> 20:37.000]  not been genetically modified in any way. You actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.800]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[24:00.700 --> 24:12.700]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[24:12.700 --> 24:17.700]  Aaron Dykes, one of our investigative reporters here and a frequent host of InfoWorks Nightly
[24:17.700 --> 24:22.300]  News, ran in during the break and he said, you know how you're talking about how the
[24:22.300 --> 24:27.980]  government runs organized crime? Well, yeah, it's on record in so many testimonies and
[24:27.980 --> 24:36.140]  Congress history. He said, don't forget Zbigniew Brzezinski, top globalist think tank leader.
[24:36.140 --> 24:43.820]  His book Between Two Ages, I remember this being on the bookshelf at my parents' house,
[24:43.820 --> 24:47.340]  this book with this cover. I didn't read it when I was a kid. I just remember that cover.
[24:47.340 --> 24:53.620]  Between Two Ages, America's role in the technotronic era. You notice the globalists call themselves
[24:53.620 --> 24:59.500]  technocrats. Okay, they've planned all of this. They've designed the technology with
[24:59.500 --> 25:04.860]  Trojan horses to control. You think the technology has the use that you're using it for, that's
[25:04.860 --> 25:10.980]  only the bait on the hook to get you to use Google, to get you to use the cell phone.
[25:10.980 --> 25:15.420]  It's designed as a tracking and taxing grid. Listen to what Brzezinski says. This is a
[25:15.420 --> 25:21.940]  guy who also wrote a book two years ago bragging that they created Al-Qaeda and that the US
[25:21.940 --> 25:29.100]  government funded Pol Pot. Just type in Zbigniew Brzezinski Pol Pot quotes. And he's very proud
[25:29.100 --> 25:33.640]  that he helped finance them and they killed 30% of their population.
[25:33.640 --> 25:41.260]  That's why he's respected by globalists. The actual owners have all at their master generals,
[25:41.260 --> 25:49.620]  their technotronic technocratic generals and Zbigniew Brzezinski is one. So is Henry Kissinger.
[25:49.620 --> 26:00.300]  This is on page six. A characteristic feature of concentrated humanity is the routinization
[26:00.300 --> 26:05.580]  of conflict. Direct violence becomes increasingly regulated and restricted and ultimately comes
[26:05.580 --> 26:12.260]  to be considered as a deviation from the norm. Organized mechanisms in the form of uniformed
[26:12.260 --> 26:17.660]  salaried personnel are established to confine violence to socially tolerable limits.
[26:17.660 --> 26:22.900]  A certain measure of crime is accepted as unavoidable for the sake of order. Therefore,
[26:22.900 --> 26:30.300]  organized crime is generally preferred to anarchic violence, thus indirectly and informally
[26:30.300 --> 26:37.540]  becoming an extension of order. There you are, page six. In fact, zoom in on that with
[26:37.540 --> 26:46.620]  a document cam shot for folks that are watching on prisonplanet.tv. So you need to understand,
[26:46.620 --> 26:51.960]  I remember some documents we've covered came out what the 70s in Chicago that what we already
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.540]  knew was going on that the police departments were regulating the crime and certifying different
[26:56.540 --> 27:04.300]  organized crime syndicates. Well, I mean, that's already known. Remember what happened
[27:04.300 --> 27:10.620]  and there's so many examples of this.
[27:10.620 --> 27:16.280]  But remember J. Edgar Hoover in the early 1950s and testimony to Congress saying there's
[27:16.280 --> 27:26.180]  no such thing as organized crime. That it is a figment of crime reporters imagination.
[27:26.180 --> 27:34.660]  Remember they were conspiracy theorists. Now why was that? Because J. Edgar Hoover on record
[27:34.660 --> 27:43.300]  lived a lifestyle of an incredibly rich person. J. Edgar Hoover was being paid off, J. Edgar
[27:43.300 --> 27:46.420]  Hoover was incredibly corrupt.
[27:46.420 --> 27:56.220]  The G men were only there to shut down small syndicates that were involved in prohibition
[27:56.220 --> 28:02.500]  running liquor that weren't paying their cut. And if you go to Hot Springs, Arkansas, which
[28:02.500 --> 28:07.020]  became the main hub of creating Everclear or Moonshine to be shipped all over the United
[28:07.020 --> 28:14.100]  States at their little museums there in the city, the tour guides on record and the books
[28:14.100 --> 28:18.820]  that they sell from little historical society. It's all the Rockefellers were there, the
[28:18.820 --> 28:26.100]  Capones, all of them and the elite would all come there to get treated for syphilis and
[28:26.100 --> 28:29.540]  other things that they had from all their sexual activity.
[28:29.540 --> 28:34.760]  But that they would produce the liquor there and then ship it by train all over the United
[28:34.760 --> 28:44.080]  States and that the US government was involved. But of course, J. Edgar Hoover in the 1950s
[28:44.080 --> 28:50.060]  could sit there and tell the childlike public, there is no such thing as organized crime.
[28:50.060 --> 28:52.780]  Now you hear that today and you're like, well, that's ridiculous. Everybody knows there's
[28:52.780 --> 29:00.980]  organized crime. Really? Hollywood teaches you that it's only the Italians or the Mexican
[29:00.980 --> 29:03.300]  mafia or some Russian mob.
[29:03.300 --> 29:13.900]  Really, the Russian mafia is the NKVD, the whole GRU, KGB apparatus that never went away,
[29:13.900 --> 29:20.860]  FSB. You can go look up the connections to that. Organized crime is only the black arm,
[29:20.860 --> 29:27.020]  the black op arm of government, government itself a black op arm of the mega banks. So
[29:27.020 --> 29:32.060]  the child kidnapping rings, the drug dealing, all of it.
[29:32.060 --> 29:37.740]  All of it is banker run, our country's everything, grow up folks. When the troops got mad about
[29:37.740 --> 29:40.900]  being told to grow the opium, the government just went public that they're growing the
[29:40.900 --> 29:45.500]  opium. I mean, that's how dumb they think you are. When a cop pulls you over, wants
[29:45.500 --> 29:49.940]  to search your car for drugs. He knows full well his boss is shipping all in.
[29:49.940 --> 29:57.900]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:57.900 --> 30:06.460]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[30:06.460 --> 30:11.800]  opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The cow been pure soap company

[32:01.180 --> 32:05.420]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[32:05.420 --> 32:10.020]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[32:10.020 --> 32:13.860]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[32:13.860 --> 32:19.540]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver
[32:19.540 --> 32:24.020]  lungs generator. Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[32:24.020 --> 32:29.660]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[32:29.660 --> 32:35.500]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[32:35.500 --> 32:42.180]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure

[33:11.380 --> 33:17.380]  Remember the time When I hit you up
[33:17.380 --> 33:30.380]  Yeah, I was alive And that you can't give up
[33:30.380 --> 33:31.380]  If I was to see you
[33:31.380 --> 33:38.380]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here five nights a week, 7
[33:38.380 --> 33:45.700]  o'clock Central, and Fall Wars Nightly News at prisonplanet.tv. Let me try to be a little
[33:45.700 --> 33:49.260]  more disciplined. Let me attempt, cuz I've only probably got 200 articles here in front
[33:49.260 --> 33:50.260]  of me.
[33:50.260 --> 34:03.100]  Every one of them I could spend three hours on. Here's CBS News out of Hercules. Where
[34:03.100 --> 34:10.660]  is Hercules? It says the Lupine Hills Elementary School in Hercules. In fact, I had this last
[34:10.660 --> 34:15.000]  night and didn't cover it because I meant to go do a search and find out where Hercules
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  is first.
[34:16.000 --> 34:24.360]  I guess it's outside San Francisco. That's what it looks like. Yeah, it is. A East Bay
[34:24.360 --> 34:29.980]  dad claims a game of tag on the playground resulted in his six year old son being accused
[34:29.980 --> 34:36.380]  of sexual assault. And the school that goes on says that touching someone on the leg is
[34:36.380 --> 34:41.720]  sexual assault. And he's now gonna be listed as basically a sexual offender and has been
[34:41.720 --> 34:43.220]  put in a database.
[34:43.220 --> 34:50.660]  Yeah, I see this all the time in the news. And they've got a local magazine called Busted,
[34:50.660 --> 34:54.500]  a weekly newspaper that comes out. And sometimes I'll buy it and look through it, mainly it's
[34:54.500 --> 35:03.660]  DWI. Sometimes you see urinating and public sexual indecency. And I see the reports where
[35:03.660 --> 35:09.380]  people pull off on the highway now in the middle of nowhere, like we all did growing
[35:09.380 --> 35:14.060]  up. And you go in the bushes and the cops pull up and run over and say, what were you
[35:14.060 --> 35:15.060]  doing?
[35:15.060 --> 35:18.200]  And if you're honest, they go over and get samples and everything, put you in handcuffs
[35:18.200 --> 35:25.580]  and take you to jail cuz they've been ordered to. And when I was up at Bilderberg 2006
[35:25.580 --> 35:32.600]  in Ottawa, Canada, in the suburb of it, the hotel was built out in a kind of defense contractor
[35:32.600 --> 35:40.020]  complex with lakes and ponds and geese everywhere. It was well, it was like 20 miles outside
[35:40.020 --> 35:42.020]  Ottawa or 15 miles outside.
[35:42.020 --> 35:47.980]  So it was big hotels and golf courses built in the countryside. And all there was was
[35:47.980 --> 35:53.300]  this hotel and then a half mile away, a defense contractor building with barbed wire fences.
[35:53.300 --> 35:58.480]  So there was nowhere to go to the bathroom. And the cops were all ordered, sometimes more
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.420]  than 20 of them, so it was about 10 squad cars at any one time, to be parked all around
[36:03.420 --> 36:04.660]  there.
[36:04.660 --> 36:10.620]  And I guess they didn't wanna go through all the security procedures to go in to the Brooksfield
[36:10.620 --> 36:19.900]  Hotel to urinate. So they would all just go across the street to a field in woods and
[36:19.900 --> 36:25.180]  urinate. And of course, the protesters over the three days were doing the same thing.
[36:25.180 --> 36:31.900]  So I'd talk to the police, most of them are really, really nice. And I was like, in the
[36:31.900 --> 36:37.700]  US, they arrest us. And he goes, arrest you for going to the bathroom in the woods? And
[36:37.700 --> 36:38.700]  he goes, yeah, I've heard that.
[36:38.700 --> 36:41.740]  And I go, but I see you guys going over there. And he goes, well, what are we supposed to
[36:41.740 --> 36:46.260]  do? And I go, exactly. So are you gonna arrest us for going over there? And he goes, no,
[36:46.260 --> 36:53.420]  that's ridiculous. See, I mean, in America, it's so sick. I mean, I hear about all the
[36:53.420 --> 37:03.300]  time. I know business people and others who've been in national forest urinating up against
[37:03.300 --> 37:06.180]  a tree and the ranger comes over and handcuffs them.
[37:06.180 --> 37:14.220]  I mean, we're being turned into totally domesticated creatures that live in a false environment.
[37:14.220 --> 37:18.420]  I said I'd discipline myself and cover 200 articles. Of course, you know it's not gonna
[37:18.420 --> 37:27.940]  happen. Here is this CBS News out of Hercules, a suburb of San Francisco. And going back
[37:27.940 --> 37:35.100]  over a decade ago, they first banned dodgeball, everybody's favorite game.
[37:35.100 --> 37:41.140]  Then they banned tag, and they banned wrestling, and then they banned touching. Guys, people
[37:41.140 --> 37:49.900]  won't believe this search, running at recess banned. I mean, there'll be hundreds of articles.
[37:49.900 --> 37:59.240]  And running is now, could be dangerous, you could fall down, you could skin your knee.
[37:59.240 --> 38:05.260]  And so they're banning running, and they were playing tag. And this child reportedly touched
[38:05.260 --> 38:11.940]  the other on the leg, tackling them. I mean, what now if a coach slaps you on the back
[38:11.940 --> 38:17.380]  or the, good job, up, sexual assault, take him to jail.
[38:17.380 --> 38:21.620]  Meanwhile, Dine Corps and Halliburton are in the Chicago Tribune Associated Press, this
[38:21.620 --> 38:27.860]  is five years ago. But hundreds of articles you can pull up where they're on record with
[38:27.860 --> 38:33.500]  C-130s and women and children they've grabbed at gunpoint, loading them up and the UN does
[38:33.500 --> 38:39.560]  it, flying them to Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Israel, where they're actual sex slaves and
[38:39.560 --> 38:41.680]  sometimes they snuff film them.
[38:41.680 --> 38:48.980]  This came out on Italian TV, this was Russian connected gangsters that were doing that,
[38:48.980 --> 38:55.500]  blowing the children's heads off. And they were selling the videos to Hollywood rich
[38:55.500 --> 39:00.820]  people, it came out in a few articles in the US. They were selling the videos for as much
[39:00.820 --> 39:05.900]  as they reported for $50,000 per VHS, this is like five, six years ago.
[39:05.900 --> 39:10.700]  VHS tapes of, I'm not gonna even say what the Italian news, the Italian news blurted
[39:10.700 --> 39:16.540]  and played it on national TV and actually got fired for it. But it was two year olds
[39:16.540 --> 39:23.260]  being raped and then having their heads blown off with revolvers. This is the type of stuff,
[39:23.260 --> 39:33.620]  so again, in this criminal, yeah, there's town hall, running at recess, banned.
[39:33.620 --> 39:40.860]  They banned running at recess and the police arrest you, there you go, town hall, George
[39:40.860 --> 39:50.180]  Will, the police arrest you. So the police arrest you for running or for playing tag,
[39:50.180 --> 40:00.460]  arrest you. But the Fortune 100 defense contractors, the UN, just type in UN sexual abuse, UN raping
[40:00.460 --> 40:03.420]  children, I mean, it's every day it's in the news.
[40:03.420 --> 40:11.020]  These are brigades of pedophile sickos who love getting paid near minimum wage and stomping
[40:11.020 --> 40:15.180]  around in the worst cesspits in the world because they can kill and murder whoever they
[40:15.180 --> 40:22.260]  want. It is hunting, raping, killing, slaughtering, raping women, full grown men, children.
[40:22.260 --> 40:28.300]  You can type into the search engine UN troops barbecuing children, UN troops raping, I mean,
[40:28.300 --> 40:36.860]  it's all there. Newspaper articles, all of it, I mean just, it is a hell force. UN troops
[40:36.860 --> 40:47.940]  in South Sudan raping children, Daily Telegraph, that was from when? Yeah, that's 2007, but
[40:47.940 --> 40:53.620]  again, I mean, it's just unlimited, that's just the first thing they pulled up.
[40:53.620 --> 41:02.580]  So this is how the criminals operate. The opium is publicly grown by our troops and
[41:02.580 --> 41:07.380]  loaded on C-130s and shipped into Europe and the United States. Pat Tillman wrote letters
[41:07.380 --> 41:11.060]  home saying he was gonna come back and talk about it, so they just murdered him. You're
[41:11.060 --> 41:15.740]  talking about 500 bill, just an opium out of there, another 500 bill, same number in
[41:15.740 --> 41:18.100]  total drugs brought into the US every year.
[41:18.100 --> 41:25.900]  There's BBC peacekeepers abusing children. They're loading them on C-130s, the highest
[41:25.900 --> 41:33.900]  dollar ones are southern and eastern and western European children. And they're engaged in
[41:33.900 --> 41:39.100]  every evil under the sun publicly. But all these Hollywood people who are concerned about
[41:39.100 --> 41:45.620]  sex trafficking, that's the big trendy thing now, the system always takes over the fight
[41:45.620 --> 41:49.540]  against breast cancer, the fight against children being kidnapped, the fight against any abuse
[41:49.540 --> 41:50.540]  that's going on.
[41:50.540 --> 41:55.540]  So they can control the debate and control the advocacy and then collect money from the
[41:55.540 --> 42:02.540]  public that they actually use to shut down cowboy grassroots traffickers in drugs, in
[42:02.540 --> 42:08.620]  organs, in diamonds, in children. These are models that are used, and they have movies
[42:08.620 --> 42:15.660]  against the blood diamonds, which is really. Now there it is, aid workers raping children,
[42:15.660 --> 42:21.700]  major charities running child kidnapping rings.
[42:21.700 --> 42:24.980]  That's good, guys. I mean, people can go find it for themselves cuz every time they put
[42:24.980 --> 42:29.820]  the articles on screen, I kind of turn and start reading them on air. It's an unlimited
[42:29.820 --> 42:37.420]  bottomless black pit directly into the vortex of hell with unlimited criminal government
[42:37.420 --> 42:40.940]  rendition flights, torture, torturing children.
[42:40.940 --> 42:44.700]  Why do you think at every one of the torture bases in Iraq, the Army's own reports, just
[42:44.700 --> 42:51.420]  type in army report on torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib and you will get the big PDF. Read
[42:51.420 --> 43:00.400]  the hundreds of pages. The phosphoric acid on the children, all of it. I mean, this is
[43:00.400 --> 43:10.900]  Dungeon Keeper Jeffrey Dahmer beyond anything you can imagine.
[43:10.900 --> 43:16.780]  And why do you think it goes on everywhere? Because it's what they like to do. And they
[43:16.780 --> 43:23.380]  sell you on torture like it's a good thing to get the bad guys to keep you safe. When
[43:23.380 --> 43:29.860]  in truth, this is a society of psychos and pit demons who want to openly do what they
[43:29.860 --> 43:31.220]  do safely.
[43:31.220 --> 43:36.060]  Because they want the big bonanza America and Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[43:36.060 --> 43:46.300]  They want to do here what they've done all over the world. Now, this is how it works.
[43:46.300 --> 43:51.500]  They publicly in the 80s and 90s got caught shipping cocaine in and still run it all in
[43:51.500 --> 43:54.660]  and still constantly get caught. Nobody gets in trouble, the government does, and select
[43:54.660 --> 43:56.580]  corporations and the banks that launder it.
[43:56.580 --> 44:00.860]  They're bringing in the opium, all of it. And when they get caught, their new thing,
[44:00.860 --> 44:09.580]  I know I marvel every day about this, is to think about this. Have Fox, CNN, MSNBC, BBC,
[44:09.580 --> 44:15.260]  ABC News all make excuses that the troops helped grow the opium. Because if they don't,
[44:15.260 --> 44:20.300]  the Al Qaeda will and they'll get the money. That's what Brzezinski says in his book Between
[44:20.300 --> 44:22.740]  Two Ages, written back in the 70s.
[44:22.740 --> 44:25.780]  Let me give you the actual publishing date. I'm going from memory that was written in
[44:25.780 --> 44:33.100]  the 70s. I did read this when I was in college, yeah, 1970. He says the governments of the
[44:33.100 --> 44:37.560]  world control organized crime because that makes it manageable. That's how they sell
[44:37.560 --> 44:39.140]  the excuse.
[44:39.140 --> 44:45.140]  Makes it manageable, grabbing kids off playgrounds and putting them on C-130s to take them so
[44:45.140 --> 44:51.200]  Saudi Arabian royalty can rape them and blow their heads off if they feel like it. No,
[44:51.200 --> 44:58.220]  the government has raced to the bottom and is purely satanic and demonic and filthy,
[44:58.220 --> 45:01.660]  serial killing, murdering demons.
[45:01.660 --> 45:09.060]  None of us are safe. Hell has been released, okay? It's already going on. The New World
[45:09.060 --> 45:15.940]  Order isn't coming. It's already here. Everybody gets upset when the troops shoot dogs or blow
[45:15.940 --> 45:21.280]  people's sheep up in Afghanistan or Iraq for fun, or torture a puppy on video.
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.920]  Because we haven't been taught, haven't seen simulated murders of dogs millions of times
[45:26.920 --> 45:31.900]  on TV. We've seen simulated murders of humans where we see it as entertainment now. We've
[45:31.900 --> 45:37.300]  lost our humanity. But through animals and all these groups wanting to protect animals,
[45:37.300 --> 45:40.540]  which I think is fine, we can find our humanity.
[45:40.540 --> 45:46.220]  What about children? What about a three-year-old, a five-year-old grabbed out of their backyard,
[45:46.220 --> 45:49.980]  grabbed out of the public school? Or a lot of times they have CPS come in and shop for
[45:49.980 --> 45:55.900]  the kids they want, and the kid just disappears. Remember six, seven years ago, CNN was reporting
[45:55.900 --> 45:59.500]  thousands of children missing that CPS had taken, and they were finding them buried and
[45:59.500 --> 46:01.540]  dead in foreign countries.
[46:01.540 --> 46:05.820]  And then that politically went to the top of the CPS, where the entire leadership were
[46:05.820 --> 46:12.500]  convicted pedophiles, and then the story stopped right there. It stopped because it went too
[46:12.500 --> 46:18.300]  high. See, there's not complete control in the media yet. There's still reporters that
[46:18.300 --> 46:24.620]  wanna get the truth out. But when they find out just how bad it is, when it breaks through
[46:24.620 --> 46:27.900]  to the other side, that's why I say I've seen reality.
[46:27.900 --> 46:35.980]  I've really studied what's going on, and it's so totally hellish. All you can do is resist
[46:35.980 --> 46:40.700]  it. There is not a discussion about backing off. A lot of people hear me talk about these
[46:40.700 --> 46:44.260]  hard things and they say, well, we better shut up. We better go along with this. These
[46:44.260 --> 46:47.300]  people sound really evil.
[46:47.300 --> 46:52.740]  Don't you get it, folks? That's how they win. That's why they've been winning. Because what
[46:52.740 --> 46:57.860]  they do is so horrible, people are intimidated, people can't believe the scope of it. You
[46:57.860 --> 47:05.660]  come face to face with something so horrible, so totally evil, that you can't believe it.
[47:05.660 --> 47:11.500]  How many times in criminology have you read where the neighbor seems so nice, so friendly,
[47:11.500 --> 47:15.600]  drives a nice car, business suit, and they dig up 30 bodies in the backyard.
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.220]  And then there's videos and photos the person has of them torturing people. And the neighbors
[47:20.220 --> 47:24.780]  are like, I had coffee with him, he took care of my son, he watered our plants. I knew him
[47:24.780 --> 47:33.380]  for 20 years, I can't believe it. You better believe it. You better believe it real good.
[47:33.380 --> 47:38.420]  Cuz I'm gonna say it again, and finally it's starting to get into the news. And I wanna
[47:38.420 --> 47:42.100]  think that we're actually getting some of this going. Here's the one that independent,
[47:42.100 --> 47:45.740]  research into mutant flu must go on.
[47:45.740 --> 47:51.380]  Just dismiss US groups fear the creation of airborne H5N1 virus could inspire bioterrorism
[47:51.380 --> 47:58.260]  as if it's gonna inspire it. They've made it. They've made mousepox, Ebola, airborne
[47:58.260 --> 48:04.780]  that kills in every case depending on what pathogen 91, 92, 93, 94. Some of these kill
[48:04.780 --> 48:11.860]  99% of the target mammalian species they're made for.
[48:11.860 --> 48:16.780]  I know I keep harping on this. I mean, the police are arresting people that run at recess
[48:16.780 --> 48:21.620]  all over the United States. You see, you think I exaggerate? I said pull up articles about
[48:21.620 --> 48:25.780]  them banning running. They pull a bunch of articles where they're arresting five-year-olds
[48:25.780 --> 48:32.380]  for running, where they're arresting seven-year-olds for tag.
[48:32.380 --> 48:37.020]  Where this is going on, meanwhile, they're grabbing children worldwide, raping them,
[48:37.020 --> 48:44.460]  and then chopping their heads off, blowing their heads off on video. And I'll never forget,
[48:44.460 --> 48:49.820]  I walked out of PF Chang's about three, four years ago. And there were a whole bunch of
[48:49.820 --> 48:51.980]  cops that have been in there eating in uniform.
[48:51.980 --> 48:57.100]  They were all laughing and stuff. And I said, hey, how are you guys doing? They go, Alex
[48:57.100 --> 49:02.300]  Jones. And of course, these were senior guys, all arrogant, drunk on their power. These
[49:02.300 --> 49:05.780]  lower level cops always seem to be better. And I'm like, hey, that's the Dine Corps building
[49:05.780 --> 49:10.540]  right there. They got a new name for it. I said, you know what they are? And they looked
[49:10.540 --> 49:13.500]  at it and said, yeah, we work there.
[49:13.500 --> 49:18.940]  I said, you know about the big sex scandals? Child kidnapping worldwide. They went, yeah,
[49:18.940 --> 49:24.740]  we do. It's just like, man, you guys think you're safe? You think that's funny? You just
[49:24.740 --> 49:32.060]  signed on spiritually to what those people did. I mean, I literally spiritually could
[49:32.060 --> 49:37.340]  just see the demons coiling around them and slithering around those cops' souls.
[49:37.340 --> 49:42.580]  I'm not saying I physically saw it. I'm just saying in the eye image in my mind, I was
[49:42.580 --> 49:49.700]  just like, well, I mean, I feel so sorry for those childlike arrested development, cowardly
[49:49.700 --> 49:56.820]  vessels of demonic filth begging to be delivered into hell. And don't worry, you're not gonna
[49:56.820 --> 50:00.420]  have to wait till you die to be delivered into hell.
[50:00.420 --> 50:07.100]  It was funny to them when responsibility showed up and talked to them. When one of the scum
[50:07.100 --> 50:13.020]  who usually are afraid of them and scurry in fear from them said something to them.
[50:13.020 --> 50:17.260]  I wanted to see what they'd say. You know what they looked at me and a couple of them
[50:17.260 --> 50:22.340]  acted thrilled and empowered and said, yeah, we work for them. And had twinkles in their
[50:22.340 --> 50:32.100]  eyes. You just signed on, pal. You're now an accomplice.
[50:32.100 --> 50:34.740]  It's not about the letter of the law, it's about the spirit of the law. You ought to
[50:34.740 --> 50:41.220]  hit your knees and repent to God. I can't imagine the type of karma, reap what you sow,
[50:41.220 --> 50:48.500]  bad luck, whatever you want to call it, that that brings on you. To make jokes about that.
[50:48.500 --> 50:54.300]  You know, if you thought I was a liar, you should have gotten my face and told me that.
[50:54.300 --> 50:58.900]  No, but you know, I'm not. You just made a joke about it. You just think about those
[50:58.900 --> 51:01.020]  little kids tied up begging for their lives.
[51:01.020 --> 51:07.300]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the info wars.com team want to relay to you

[51:52.660 --> 52:01.920]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. We all know that Berkey

[53:06.100 --> 53:10.900]  of a dark house that looks like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target.
[53:10.900 --> 53:15.500]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small
[53:15.500 --> 53:19.900]  electronic device that makes the same light as a real television. So from outside it looks
[53:19.900 --> 53:24.420]  like someone is home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but is
[53:24.420 --> 53:29.780]  far more convincing to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm and
[53:29.780 --> 53:34.460]  is highly recommended by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order
[53:34.460 --> 53:42.900]  your fake TV for only $34.95 go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake
[53:42.900 --> 53:48.460]  TV is only $29.95 so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security and peace
[53:48.460 --> 53:57.980]  of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. Faketv.com, the burglar
[53:57.980 --> 54:06.540]  deterrent.
[54:06.540 --> 54:11.940]  All right, here's the deal. More and more you notice I get to some of the news but not
[54:11.940 --> 54:18.940]  a lot of it because everything is connected. You know, I read an article about being charged
[54:18.940 --> 54:22.820]  with sexual assault. You know, you're seven years old or whatever because you played tag
[54:22.820 --> 54:28.380]  and touch somebody on the leg.
[54:28.380 --> 54:33.740]  Or how kids are being arrested period as young as five. This is a six year old with a sexual
[54:33.740 --> 54:40.060]  assault, yeah. As young as five being arrested just for running. USA Today, Town Hall all
[54:40.060 --> 54:47.660]  reporting it with straight faces. Like should we be arresting five year olds? That's like
[54:47.660 --> 54:53.020]  saying should we be shooting ourselves in the head? No.
[54:53.020 --> 54:57.020]  But it's all about control mechanisms about making the general public criminals. That's
[54:57.020 --> 55:02.260]  why I get so mad when a cop pulls me over and starts asking me what's in my car and
[55:02.260 --> 55:08.140]  asking me if I have drugs. I'm like, are you kidding? Even if I did, which I don't, any
[55:08.140 --> 55:14.060]  moron knows the drugs are shipped in by the government.
[55:14.060 --> 55:21.620]  And then you wanna bust me with some to put me in prison? I mean, I don't even eat your
[55:21.620 --> 55:27.860]  MSG. By the way, you know the type of drugs they put in our food? If you read those additives,
[55:27.860 --> 55:33.140]  every one of those pharmacological additives is just a drug that they got added as a food
[55:33.140 --> 55:34.140]  additive.
[55:34.140 --> 55:39.660]  Here's New Yorker magazine, The Caging of America. Why do we lock up so many people?
[55:39.660 --> 55:45.140]  And it goes on to report there's now 6 million people. 6 million people are under correctional
[55:45.140 --> 55:50.540]  supervision in the US, more than were in Stalin's gulags. Yeah, no one has ever done that. And
[55:50.540 --> 55:55.500]  by the way, all over the world, prison populations are skyrocketing.
[55:55.500 --> 55:59.260]  You can't tell me the federal courts are real and they've been caught in all their fraud
[55:59.260 --> 56:06.180]  and they convict 98%. You think 98% are guilty? They only have that kind of conviction rate
[56:06.180 --> 56:11.260]  in North Korea and here. You can't tell me 6 million people in prison? And by the way,
[56:11.260 --> 56:13.380]  they're colleges of crime.
[56:13.380 --> 56:18.780]  You take somebody and for a nonviolent offense, you put them in jail, ruin their future having
[56:18.780 --> 56:23.760]  a career. They're gonna get out only knowing criminals and they're gonna become criminals,
[56:23.760 --> 56:29.260]  which is what the system wants. They wanna irrevocably destroy people's lives. This is
[56:29.260 --> 56:34.340]  a scorched earth New World Order takeover system, period.
[56:34.340 --> 56:41.680]  I wanna get your take on this and more 800-259-9231. I got all the latest on Newt Gingrich and
[56:41.680 --> 56:49.100]  Mitt Romney, I'll get to it after some calls. Even Rhinos cannot support Newt Gingrich and
[56:49.100 --> 56:52.500]  I'm not saying that makes Mitt Romney good, it's just Gingrich, if it's possible, is even
[56:52.500 --> 56:53.960]  worse.
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.820]  And now Newt goes nuclear, Gingrich slams pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-tax increase
[56:58.820 --> 57:05.500]  moderate Mitt Romney. Well, I mean, that's basically what Newt's been in the past but
[57:05.500 --> 57:10.340]  flip-flopped. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's two globalists fighting with each other as if
[57:10.340 --> 57:11.700]  we've got to choose one of them.
[57:11.700 --> 57:15.860]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul is right in there with them, but the media never gives Ron Paul attention.
[57:15.860 --> 57:19.460]  They act like, they're always asking, when are you gonna drop out? But the key is more
[57:19.460 --> 57:23.340]  dirt's coming out on Gingrich, more is coming out on Romney. And as they destroy each other,
[57:23.340 --> 57:27.740]  Ron Paul moves up. Now there's election fraud involved, but we know we're not gonna win
[57:27.740 --> 57:30.900]  if we don't come to the table and fight, we won't even be able to expose the fraud if
[57:30.900 --> 57:31.900]  we don't fight.
[57:31.900 --> 57:38.140]  At least Ron Paul's in there injecting real issues. Also coming up, I've been telling
[57:38.140 --> 57:44.180]  you this forever because it was in a British Ministry of Defense report 2007. But now they're
[57:44.180 --> 57:49.420]  telling the general public, UK riots, paratroopers are trained in riot control. British troops
[57:49.420 --> 57:53.940]  are being trained in riot control activities and fears that violence and looting will return
[57:53.940 --> 57:56.300]  to Britain streets.
[57:56.300 --> 58:04.420]  Now in the United States, the Army Times and all the other big publications are all stars
[58:04.420 --> 58:09.220]  and stripes, you name it, reporting that they're preparing for martial law. But then the National
[58:09.220 --> 58:13.360]  News attacks myself and Ron Paul for warning of this, just cuz we actually read the Army
[58:13.360 --> 58:14.360]  Times.
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.480]  It's like, look, they say they're gonna do this. You're crazy, cuz they're not ready
[58:18.480 --> 58:23.820]  for you to know about this yet. So they communicate with each other. But then when someone actually
[58:23.820 --> 58:29.940]  reads it, that's a conspiracy theory. And Kurt Nemo got an article, British Army exercise
[58:29.940 --> 58:33.660]  to put down insurrection. You can see the drills here. I'm gonna show you a photo of
[58:33.660 --> 58:42.740]  this. It's amazing. Gosh, look at that photo of them with the machine guns.
[58:42.740 --> 58:54.580]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:12.740 --> 59:18.220]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[59:18.220 --> 59:24.700]  dependency, your food supply. Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:33.620]  All right, I've been ranting and covering news in the first hour. We're now into the
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.340]  second hour. Dr. Catherine Albrecht on the global Internet censorship grid that's going
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.340]  into place is gonna be joining us.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.620]  Coming up in the third hour, we'll also take some calls in the second half of that. I do
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:50.500]  wanna take your calls in the shower. There's a new article up at Infowars.com titled Indie
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:55.620]  Super Bowl National Security State Protects Sports Fans From Prostitutes. We'll be telling
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.540]  you about that briefly after the break when we go to more calls.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:04.620]  And it ties in with British Army exercises to put down insurrection. There's an amazing
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:10.500]  photo right here where it shows the British Army searching people, getting ready to roll
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:17.260]  this out on a wider scale. But right now, let's go ahead and go to some of your phone
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.260]  calls.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.260]  Sam in the UK, speaking of the UK. Hi, Sam.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:29.700]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. How's it going, man? Good. Long time listener, about
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:37.180]  three years now. As I'm speaking, I can feel my chest kind of, my blood boil, cuz every
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:42.020]  day it's, if it's not one thing, it's the other thing, and it's just on top of each
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020]  other all the time.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.220]  I had a little list I was gonna talk about, but I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.340]  a bit concerned about the Internet. Obviously, without the Internet, if there was no Internet,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.980]  I wouldn't have known about you, I wouldn't have known about your films, I wouldn't be
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.780]  a prison time member or anything like that.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.700]  If they do take it down, what do you think is the next step? What do you think we can
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:08.420]  do about it? Well, no, as they're gonna selectively start taking it down with these excuses they've
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.020]  got that don't have due process. Shutting down websites, shutting down content, banning
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.940]  individuals through a biometric Internet ID.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:21.580]  So that's the thing, people are like, biometrics, all thumbprint to go to Disney World or to
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:27.720]  get in the gym or whatever. Then they can turn off your thumbprint and the place won't
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.460]  even accept your cash. This is what's globally gonna be standardized, you've got a thumbprint
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.460]  even to use cash.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.820]  Now they can stop you from buying and selling. Now they can add any taxes or fines or fees
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:44.860]  they want. They're now about to try to implement everything we've warned you about. All of
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:49.240]  this has just been the globalist getting a standardized new world order in place.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.840]  Now they're preparing to launch the whole thing on the people. And so they've gone from
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.420]  building it and beta testing it to now just openly overthrowing the Bill of Rights Constitution,
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:04.900]  Magna Carta in the UK and saying it's gone. Admitting they're spying on you, taking your
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.500]  children for no reason, putting video cameras in the homes of people when they have kids
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.660]  preemptively like they're criminals beyond 1984.
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:20.460]  Just total evil, banning protesting in many cities in London and other areas as you know,
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:26.720]  tracking everybody. I mean, the crooks, when they start shutting down the web, that's when
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.960]  they start arresting political dissidents. That's when they'll kill me. That's when they'll
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.240]  start their garbage.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.700]  And that's when people then have to defend themselves. I mean, you can't just let a bunch
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.900]  of total criminal scum come and take you and your family away and do God knows what with
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.100]  your children. I mean, these are people that think it's funny to kill kids on average.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.660]  I mean, they have sick demons working for them. They've gone through the police and
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:58.180]  the military and found the sick demons and promoted them. And we're facing unmitigated
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:03.820]  evil. I don't know how to describe it, sir.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.980]  I mean, Alex, I mean, I was trying to say that to all the Americans. I've never been
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.700]  to America. I see it on TV. I think, yeah, one day I'm going to go down there. But I'm
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:17.340]  just going to say that you guys need to look after the Second Amendment. You need to make
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:22.220]  sure you look after that because that is the one thing that's going to protect anything
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.220]  that you've got.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.460]  You know what I mean? You've got to look after that.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:31.220]  You're right. In fact, guys, I didn't see it printed from our article. I saw the Amo
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:36.060]  Land story. Will you print me the Info Wars version? It'll be in the archives now of our
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:42.020]  article about New Jersey moves to ban all handgun ammo, most rifle ammo. God bless you
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.020]  from the UK. Sam, anything else?
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:49.020]  That's it, man. Just take care of yourself and we've got your back. We're doing everything
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.020]  we can.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.500]  Well, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we better use the Internet while we've still
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:05:01.420]  got it. That's what I keep saying. I mean, this is not a game. This is not a game.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:08.340]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:14.020]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:25.940]  in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:40.060]  need it most. Blue diamond gusset's got it. Others don't.

[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:18.620]  is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth. This film
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:24.880]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.060]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:33.940]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:40.220]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:45.580]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only

[01:07:53.540 --> 01:08:17.820]  see Calvin on the web at five star soap.com. A bunch of greedy, arrogant control freaks
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:23.660]  and all the little fancy business suits commanding huge paramilitary armies believe they can
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:30.660]  take down our society worldwide. They believe that they can install their enforcement of
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.340]  despotism against us.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:37.100]  Well, there are a bunch of illegal criminals who have proven that by their actions and
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:43.340]  are illegitimate. And I declare independence against the transhumanist eugenics death cult
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:49.740]  known as the New World Order. You are illegitimate, criminal, degenerate scum. You are lawless
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:56.780]  trash and you are not my rulers. I am a sovereign American and people are sovereign worldwide
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.220]  as human beings.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.520]  I'm not only a sovereign American, because America is only based on the fact that the
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:10.540]  individual is sovereign, endowed by their creator with unalienable rights. You can pass
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:17.540]  laws all day saying I'm your slave. I'm not scum. And if you notice that as we lose our
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:21.540]  liberties and as our freedoms are flushed down the toilet, as the oxygen leaves the
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.220]  room, the prosperity leaves as well, that that's the thing.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:32.060]  You want freedom. Any time a system, a corporate system, a government system tries to get rid
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:40.440]  of basic freedoms, basic checks and balances, look out, look out and boy is it lookout time.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:48.720]  You think stuff's bad now? This is an engineered depression. I'm gonna go to Jim Wilson, Angie
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.720]  and others.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:59.260]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231. And I want your view on the
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:05.100]  news on Ron Paul, on military in Europe, the US, England openly trying to take on the people
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:10.140]  now. They've gone from denying it to admitting it, saying they'll secretly arrest us, tasering
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.060]  and attacking peaceful demonstrators all over the country.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:20.260]  Those videos are pouring in, an incredible piece of legislation out of New Jersey and
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:24.620]  they've got similar ones in California and other areas. New Jersey bill aims to ban all
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:32.180]  handgun ammo, some rifle ammo. If you think I'm joking, we have links to the NRA and ammo
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:36.760]  land on this and we've read the bill, it also bans any alteration on a gun.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.740]  You add some kind of sites, you do something, it's called defacing, it's illegal. In an
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:47.920]  end run around an all out gun ban, the New Jersey Assembly of Law and Public Safety Committee
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.960]  is set to consider legislation that would ban ammunition under the auspices of protecting
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960]  police.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.180]  And you gotta love this idea that the police, if anything could, well cars could kill a
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.020]  cop, better ban those. The police on record said they don't have to protect us, it's not
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:08.380]  their job to, they're really there to enforce revenue collection. And if they do protect
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.340]  you, it takes 10, 15 minutes to get there when they do do their job or are allowed to.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:21.960]  But you shouldn't be able to have a gun like Chicago or New York or England. But then they
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:28.240]  have guns to protect themselves. The language seemingly targets the already prohibited armor
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.020]  piercing ammunition, but would encompass any ammo that is deemed to quote, pose a threat
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.640]  to the safety and well being of law enforcement.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:41.160]  And the well being, Ammo Land is reporting that the common hunting target and self defense
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.800]  ammunition would be subject to ban along with BBs, air gun pellets and non-metallic ammunition
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.940]  like plastic airsoft pellets. The NRA concurs and it goes through the whole deal and we
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:54.380]  have a link to the bill.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.340]  Here's another little little little juicy that just went up at infowars.com and then
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:14.740]  I'm going to your phone calls. Okay, continuing here. Indie Super Bowl National Security State
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:23.740]  protects sports fans from prostitutes. You just heard me right. Remember Aaron Dykes
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.340]  this article last week of Homeland Security press releases where they said we are going
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:31.260]  to federalize your police, we're going to hire your police.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.300]  We're going to have checkpoints, mobile trucks, body scanners, house scanners. They're already
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:40.640]  on the streets in many areas. We're going to finance all these new face scanning cameras,
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.260]  license plate readers. We're taking over, but not to even fight foreign terrorism. No,
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:51.500]  the new thing is domestic groups, anti-government groups and crime.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:59.340]  And Kurt Nemo has links here to the government's own press releases that all criminal activity
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:06.380]  including pickpocketing and prostitution, Homeland Security, federal police and TSA
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:12.260]  are going to be there fighting crime. No more jurisdiction always inserting themselves in
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.260]  any big event.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:17.840]  I mean, the last few years they've had big sis up on telescreens telling the people there
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.660]  to watch each other. I mean, just a totally paranoid, whacked out sick culture. Meanwhile,
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:27.460]  Al-Qaeda publicly works for the banks that run the US. They've given Al-Qaeda Libya,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.700]  they're giving them Syria, they're giving them everything.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.540]  Indianapolis local cops and FBI have set up a massive surveillance grid ahead of the Super
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:41.300]  Bowl. And they have behavioral scanning cameras on February 5th. The heightened security including
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:47.940]  a smartphone photo and video surveillance network, the installation of 150 new manhole
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.900]  covers, like terrorists will put bombs on them.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:56.180]  And virtual lockdown of a 44 block area is not response to any possible attack by Al-Qaeda,
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:04.060]  but will be used to quote direct signs of pickpocketing, prostitution and other trouble.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:08.900]  According to the Department of Homeland Security, the Super Bowl rates as a national security
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:15.100]  event or NSSE that may be a target of potential terrorism and other criminal activity, possibly
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.740]  of the sort mentioned above.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:25.100]  And it just goes on to talk about FEMA and all the groups that are gonna be there. And
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:29.400]  of course now TSA has standardized groping of everyone. I think I'll have Kurt add that
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.860]  to his article that they run the training and the groping. Okay, let's go to your calls,
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.860]  Jim, Wilson, Angie and others.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.700]  Jim in Texas, you're on the air. Hey, buddy.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:47.300]  Well, it's been a couple of years since I've talked to you, man. Like most callers, I have
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:51.460]  to say kudos to you, man. You've been right on the bat about the things you predicted.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:57.180]  They don't always happen in the exact timeframe that you think they might, but usually you're
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:03.980]  pretty damn on schedule, man. Anyway, as far as the Ron Paul thing goes, how do we know
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.780]  what's true? Every person I've talked to in the country, and I talk to people randomly
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.620]  that don't even know, every one of them say they vote Ron Paul, so.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:21.900]  Well, I know this, I was in the central counting area in the Republican primary in 1995 for
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:27.740]  the, or was it 1996 for the 1996 presidential election. I was in the central tabulation
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:33.740]  area and talked to everybody and it was stacking ballots coming in for Travis County.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:38.980]  And Pat Buchanan had well over half, and I think he got like 2% in the counting when
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:44.060]  it was all counted, because you would stick the scantron ballots in a computer. Now later
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:48.340]  we found out there was fraud county wide. Of course, I mean, this is an organized crime
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.740]  syndicate to rob everybody.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:56.300]  I mean, that's how they get away with 80% power price increases in a year. And say it's
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:02.180]  for the earth, well, it's really for the groups robbing us. All over the nation, we're seeing
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:07.740]  election fraud, South Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, though he still came in second
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.380]  place there.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.880]  And undoubtedly Ron Paul is really the front runner. You've seen him cheat him on time.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.620]  You've seen him cheat him on coverage. When they do cover him, it's negative. You've seen
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.420]  all the polls where media's cheated, where he's in first or second place and they just
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:26.920]  don't even mention that in the poll results. So yes, but see Ron Paul understands if he
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.040]  just says, it's all a fraud, that will derail momentum.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:37.700]  And that won't cause a huge grassroots awakening. And then he'll fall behind. It won't even
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:43.660]  be in the debates or stay in these primaries to educate people and to build campaign for
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:48.180]  liberty. But yes, there is strategic vote fraud all over the country. It's undoubtedly
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:53.060]  being used against Ron Paul with a lot of other attacks.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:58.500]  And he just can't look like a sore loser because still a lot of the public are childlike. I
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.540]  mean, the government took everybody's blood for 40 years secretly at birth. The government
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.460]  shot up people with syphilis. The government radiates foster kids to death and I don't
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.460]  mean in the 50s.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.340]  Yeah, it happened then too. New York Daily News, they grabbed kids and test pesticides
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:16.040]  on them until they die. Look it up, folks. The people running things are a guild of psycho
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:22.140]  criminals who have gotten away with everything. So why shouldn't they get away with more?
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.620]  They've had die-bold officials go public. They've had people be killed who've gone public.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:34.380]  We've certified fraud in Ohio, the 2004 election. Yes, it's going on. Look, of course, a bunch
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:40.620]  of crooks came in to control this country's $15 trillion a year economy. When you get
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:44.740]  rid of checks and balances and don't have paper ballots and it's designed for fraud,
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.620]  you're going to be robbed, period, Jim.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:53.180]  Absolutely, man, I agree with you 100%, Alex. And I know everybody I've spoken to, like
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:57.820]  I said, I speak to people at random. I'm not afraid to just strike up a conversation with
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:02.860]  somebody and see where their mind's at. Unfortunately, most of them's minds are what you describe
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:08.660]  as within the Overton window. I rarely ever meet an individual that's able to have free
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.140]  thought. It's so rare anymore.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:18.180]  Well, yeah, people value having a restricted and childlike mind. They think that protects
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:23.180]  them because they think that makes reality. Just cuz you dress up in a Batman outfit doesn't
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:28.420]  make you Batman, folks. Just cuz you imagine, that's extreme cuz lying talking heads who
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.060]  practice looking official told you so.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:38.020]  But yes, there is incredible systemic election fraud. That's why they don't care. There's
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:44.100]  a 9% approval rating for Congress. The government is telling us they're allowed to insider trade
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:50.020]  and that it's legal when it's illegal. They're openly massing military force against us.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:57.060]  But you know the good news? The voting that they can't cover up is donations. Ron Paul,
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:03.860]  74%, last number I saw, of all military donations for the Democrat candidate, Obama, and all
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.280]  the Republicans are going to Ron Paul.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.660]  So again, people say, well, then why are you saying the military is praying for war? They're
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:16.900]  creating the cadres over the last decade, shifting out who wants to shoot Americans.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.620]  Who is a psycho or who is so stupid they'll follow orders. And they've built this army
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:25.980]  of darkness. The rest of the troops who know what's going on, that's why the government's
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.940]  now telling cops they're the enemy.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:35.540]  Get ready for war with the vets. Do you understand that? We've actually got the vets. But again,
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.020]  we don't want the physical war, ladies and gentlemen. It's not going to do anything to
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:46.100]  shoot up a bunch of stupid cops in military, okay? It's the globalist. It's only a few
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:51.980]  thousand top globalists. They are the enemy. We've got to identify the crime syndicate.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:57.060]  We identify the enemy and they lose all credibility. They will fall. They won't get away with the
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:01.340]  dictatorship. When they try the dictatorship is when we win.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.740]  Do you use a CPAP breathing device to help treat sleep apnea and prevent snoring? If
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:09.420]  so, you should know big insurance companies and government regulations can affect the
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.180]  way you buy sleep apnea equipment. They decide what devices you receive, when you get replacement
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.600]  equipment and even what you pay. Why limit the quality of your treatment? Break away

[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:12.440]  be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes. You would be

[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:07.260]  This is the end, beautiful friend. This is the end, my only friend. The end of our elaborate
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:14.260]  lives. The end of everything that stands. The end, no safety. No safety. No safety.
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:44.260]  Okay, here's the deal. I'm gonna go to Wilson and Angie here. I knew as soon as I gave the
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.540]  number out and only 4 callers got in, there was a phone system problem, because we can
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:52.740]  open the phones up and get 100 calls in from our great listeners. The phone system, computer
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:57.340]  system's locked up, so no more calls can come in. We're gonna try to get that rebooted and
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.380]  keep taking your calls. I've got a bunch of breaking news we'll cover after the break.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:05.700]  But right now, let's go to Wilson and then Angie. Wilson in Florida, welcome.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:12.700]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex. It's always good to talk to you. I'm a student at Miami Dade
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:18.820]  College on Wilson campus downtown, and I'm very enthusiastic about the Constitution and
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:25.140]  about also Ron Paul, because he is the one who's unfortunate, you know? And I'm a delivery
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:30.220]  driver and I even met during a delivery from Ron Paul supporters, and they invited me to
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:36.980]  Duffy's Tavern one time about a week ago, and they was raising money and we had a lot
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:42.060]  of discussions there, so I really am happy that there is people out there that are like
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:49.060]  me and like you and will stand up for our rights. But I have two quick questions. First
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:55.300]  question is, why don't we reenact the Declaration, the signing of the Constitution and the Bill
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:26:02.060]  of Rights, and start fresh? Why can't we get the amount of delegates from each state and
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:04.060]  then just do it over, you know?
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:08.540]  Well, listen, that is actually, if you read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:14.300]  of 2007, it's got incredible language, even crazier than the NDAA in many respects, where
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:20.740]  it says we will create a 10-member governor council. The states will have no more power.
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:27.740]  Those 10 governors served the president, and this Defense Authorization Act of 2007 that
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:36.500]  went into effect 2008 has sections on insurrection in the states even by legislatures. So it's
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:44.040]  like an announcement that the Federal District of Criminals, this occupying alien system
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.900]  run by the banks, the foreign banks, is saying we're prepared for the state's rights movement
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.300]  and are prepared for war.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:57.140]  And of course, they activated NORTHCOM. And NORTHCOM is a military jurisdiction over the
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:02.260]  United States. Look at AFRICON, is now a jurisdiction over Africa. They just attack and kill whoever
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:09.260]  they want, whenever they want anywhere. Now under NDAA 2012, that they passed in 2011
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:17.380]  just a month ago, exactly today, it was the 31st of December, 2011, they openly say there
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:24.380]  that worldwide, without congressional approval, the president or the military leadership,
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:30.260]  the Secretary of Defense, can kill anybody they want anytime, attack any country or any
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:30.820]  person.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:37.140]  That's just global declaration of war that would make Hitler blush. We'll kill our own
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:42.660]  citizens, arrest them, secretly disappear them. And Senator Graham goes, you bet we'll
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:48.540]  kill you. You bet you don't get a lawyer. I want you to be scared. Santorum says, hey,
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:52.820]  we're already killing US citizens without charging them. Of course, it's for killing
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:53.820]  Americans.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:58.660]  I mean, these are terrorists who tell us that they're doing this to fight Al-Qaeda when
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:05.260]  Al-Qaeda publicly works for them. It's like the troops publicly grow the opium on the
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:12.900]  news. And the cops are doing drag nets looking for heroin. I mean, it's bonker land, cuckoo
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:20.540]  for cocoa puffs, in our face crazy. I mean, it's amazing. It's like the media says, vaccines
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:26.180]  don't cause autism, but the insert says it can cause brain damage.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:32.500]  And Guillain-Barre's and neurological disorders and Parkinson's and all that, or kill you.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.340]  I mean, the insert says it can do it, but then you're a conspiracy theorist if you say
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:44.300]  it's doing it. I mean, that's what I mean. It's all insane. It's insane. It's insane.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:53.920]  It's insane. It's crazy. The UN runs giant child kidnapping rings publicly. They've got
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.740]  private contractor groups that do it internationally running CPS all over the US.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:05.180]  They do it here. It's already going on. But people think it's no big deal because the
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:08.660]  media doesn't make a big issue out of it. Anything else, sir?
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:14.580]  Yep, yep. I'm glad you know you put out all the information. I know we have a lot against
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.580]  us, but I'm very optimistic, especially that we have such great intellectual minds on our
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:24.620]  side, especially like you. Even that I delivered to downtown in Burkle here in Miami that some
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:29.260]  of the wealthiest people on the top penthouse floor, I have conversations with them and
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.260]  they're aware.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.940]  Tell you what, stay there. I want to hear about this. Then we'll get to Angie on the
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.340]  other side. Stay there. Don't hang up. I want to hear the story, Wilson. And we got a ton
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:40.540]  of news coming up. Kirk just brought me some incredible info during the break. We'll be
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:50.380]  right back. Stay with us.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:30:01.100]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:06.000]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century? Record foreclosure
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.140]  rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors thankful for the unemployment checks and she
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:16.400]  were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:21.220]  gift along with thousands of other Americans. Did you ever think your future would feel
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:26.940]  this out of control? The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:33.420]  control your greatest dependency, your food supply. Make 2012 the year you take control
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.780]  by getting prepared. E Foods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in

[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:03.980]  Direct. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.940]  power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:14.000]  bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.060]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:23.720]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:29.360]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.700]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:38.340]  of families lose their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:42.540]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.620]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:53.380]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:32:02.940]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365. Hi folks, this is
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:07.100]  Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs generator. Now you can produce
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:12.420]  pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:16.880]  By breathing the solution through the lungs, the respiratory system is the first line of
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.300]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:29.140]  system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:34.420]  instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:40.920]  products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs generator.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:46.140]  Simply easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:21.980]  Okay my friends, the phone system has come back up and is allowing calls in. I see they've
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:29.100]  loaded up there. The toll-free number is 800-259-9231. Let me go to these two calls that have been
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:33.820]  holding, then I'll get to some more of the news that's really important. And then we
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:38.460]  will go back to your calls ahead of Dr. Catherine Albrecht joining us to look at the attack
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:43.340]  on Internet freedom worldwide, what Google's up to, and the rest of the story as Paul Harvey
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:49.500]  would say. But going back to Wilson in Florida. So Wilson, you're saying you deliver stuff
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.580]  as I guess part of a courier service or whatever you're doing. So you're talking to a lot of
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:56.680]  wealthy people and you chat them up and they're aware of what's going on.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:03.760]  That's what I'm finding. I cannot put numbers on it, but it is exponential the fact that
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.340]  people are really getting it. But even if they're getting that the government's corrupt
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:16.580]  and run by crooks, they've gotta get the fact that it's run by super nasty, super evil people.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:21.060]  I mean the fact that the UN and others and our government is involved in the sex traffic
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:28.180]  including children, I mean that is the worst of the worst. I mean even in prisons, those
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.820]  are the people that don't live a day.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:36.180]  I mean even amongst criminals, rapists and murderers, they don't put up with people that
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:43.140]  target kids. I mean it's the worst of the worst of the worst. And you automatically
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:47.200]  can't believe anything they say, you automatically can't believe anything they do. And it's never
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:54.420]  true anyways. But these are confirmed known liars. It's like the video I did last Friday
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:35:00.960]  that's gone viral at infoawars.com titled TSA, the greatest liars on Earth.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:07.560]  You wanna fight them? This is coffin nails. This is cyanide to their lies. This is holy
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:14.220]  water to the vampire. This is high noon to a goblin. You need to get that video and get
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:20.740]  it out to everybody you know. It is so informative. And it doesn't just cover TSA lies, it covers
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.740]  government lies.
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:25.820]  And I got some breaking news concerning the TSA that Kurt Nimmo is working on right now,
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.460]  but we're gonna go back to your calls. Finish up your point, Wilson, I appreciate you holding.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:35.940]  Oh, yep, yep. Well, see, like I said, I also am a student at Miami-Dade and I deliver for
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:41.940]  Pizza Hut, so you know it's not nothing big. But I had a lot of extra copies from the last
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:46.620]  semester from the December 8th issue. When I wrote an article, it was titled the founding
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:51.260]  father's premonitions. So I was passing out a whole bunch of those articles to almost
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:54.940]  every customer. You know, I got a lot of good feedback from a lot of people, surprisingly,
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:59.500]  you know. Some people just hold no interest when I gave it to them, but the next time
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.340]  I showed up, they was really enthusiastic.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:06.780]  But listen, that's what you gotta do. We've all gotta communicate and find our brothers
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:11.300]  and sisters in liberty. They're of every race, color and creed. We gotta get together. We've
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:16.220]  gotta all communicate so we realize how many of us there are. Look, look, I tell this story
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:18.420]  all the time because it's so key.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:25.380]  I have been doing this 17 years. And I got recognized right off the bat every once in
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:30.380]  a while. But in the last decade, everywhere I go, I get recognized. People buy me dinner
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:35.400]  when I'm in a restaurant. I'm not asking folks to, it's actually kinda, it's weird when people
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.400]  do stuff for you.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.220]  But the point is, now I can't walk the dog down the street. I can't walk into a mall.
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:46.960]  I can't go in a grocery store 10 feet. I mean, I go to the grocery store anywhere. It's every
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:52.820]  third person. I can go to foreign countries. I can be in a poor fishing village in Honduras.
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:37:01.060]  Or I can be in southern Mexico, and the tour bus driver's a listener. And again, I'm just
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.780]  one person.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:08.780]  So I'm telling you, our numbers are much greater than we even know. The average person isn't
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:16.220]  recognized, isn't known, isn't a, quote, public person. And so you don't have an idea how
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:23.060]  awake people are. I do, I do, folks, and it is exciting. Go ahead, sir.
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:27.940]  So yep, my last question is, I know you speak to Ron Paul a lot. I'll be voting for him
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:34.780]  tomorrow in the Florida primary. But my question is, before all this is over, before he's,
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:39.540]  I mean, hopefully he does win the presidency, I think that'll be great for us.
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:46.620]  But I would like to see if he could speak directly to President Obama. I've never seen
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:52.020]  him speak directly to him, and I think that would be amazing. I think it'll be all over
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.020]  the news.
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:57.980]  Did you hear my last interview with Ron Paul about a month ago?
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.300]  I must have not heard it.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:05.380]  Yeah, we should re-air it, because it's probably the best interview I've ever done of over
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:11.420]  100 with him. And I said to him, I said, Congressman, why are you attacking the other candidates?
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:15.620]  I know you need to do that cuz of their records, but I think you should do what Romney's doing,
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:18.700]  attack up, go after Obama.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:27.900]  And he said, I agree with you. I need to do that more. And so I'm not gonna get in the
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.300]  middle of it. Ron Paul's got a lot of great people working for him. But he's also got
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.980]  kind of mainline Republican types as well, cuz they're just part of the establishment
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.980]  there in DC.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:43.340]  That's who there is available from that pool of people. And he's got a great chief of staff
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:50.940]  in Congress. But I'm not gonna sit here and second guess Ron Paul all day. He's done a
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:55.940]  great job. I don't think he should do so much retail politicking, exhausting himself eight
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:57.540]  hours a day shaking hands.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:03.460]  I'm sorry, he needs to hit them with electronic media. People always want me to travel and
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:09.220]  speak here and do this, that, and talk to folks there. And I do do some of that. It's
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:13.580]  just that I turn down radio interviews every day where I'd be talking to tens of thousands
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.600]  or hundreds of thousands or millions.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.620]  So why should I travel? And in the time that I do that and speak, I could talk to 5 million
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:25.260]  people. Instead, I go speak to 1,000. And I understand it's important to do some of
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:29.740]  that. But I just think he should go pretty much all electronic cuz he's old and it's
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:33.460]  exhausting him to do all that retail politicking.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:40.700]  And I think he should be savaging Obama as a lying globalist puppet. And that would really
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:44.580]  fire up the Republican base as well. God bless you, I appreciate your call. I've already
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:50.940]  brought it up to him. I mean, here's the deal. I've got Ron Paul's home phone number. I try
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:56.680]  to get all of them that way. I know some of his family. I can call Congress. Sometimes
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.800]  when they don't set him up for the show, I've got to call his chief of staff and say, hey,
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.380]  they're not setting him up.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:06.260]  He wants to come on every month, but it's every six, eight weeks. If he's too busy,
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:11.340]  I understand. And then they go ask Ron Paul and he's like, no, I wanna come on. And I've
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:17.500]  talked to Ron Paul before off air and said, hey, do you wanna come on every six months
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.500]  if you're busy?
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:21.140]  Cuz it's like pulling teeth to get you on. He goes, no, we're just really busy. I wanna
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:24.540]  come on every month. He doesn't say something if he doesn't want to. And then it's just
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:30.160]  pulling teeth getting through the gatekeepers. Because obviously he's super busy. Obviously
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:35.380]  it takes time. He can't do everything. So I'm not even blaming people there. And I don't
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.620]  even try to give him my advice.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:41.900]  I rarely give Ron Paul advice. I did last time he was on. He's a really smart guy. He's
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.620]  always on top of every news item I raise. He lives this stuff. He is conscious. He is
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:52.940]  awake. And he's a real person. He has basically no ego. I can tell you looking at him and
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:55.540]  watching him, he's in the machine mode.
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:41:02.100]  I'm in the machine mode, but I'm not disciplined enough to not get angry. Because it's so ridiculous
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.920]  how over the top the corruption is. I mean, it's almost like after you've already convicted
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.740]  somebody 5,000 times, okay, they committed another 5,000 murders. We're gonna have 5,000
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.740]  more trials. And then sit here and try to convince people that we've got corrupt elites
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:17.740]  that are out of control.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:23.180]  I mean, that's like convincing people to not jump off a cliff. I mean, everybody should
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:33.500]  see this for themselves. Ron Paul, see, I don't even wanna get into the advice department
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:39.200]  for Ron Paul. Cuz he's the one in the arena right now. And you know what, he's gotta take
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:43.300]  the punches that are getting thrown at him. He's gotta throw his punches.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.900]  And that's why I understand you wanna give him advice. I've given him that exact advice.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:56.940]  But then it just opens up a Pandora's box of issues. So I just go through channels,
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:01.140]  send our email, hey, we wanna get Ron Paul on, we'll tape it if you want, or live, whatever
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:06.980]  you want. And then if that goes on sometimes for a couple weeks after a month, then I have
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:14.780]  to go above people's heads and get a hold of the top folks.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:21.900]  But that happens in any organization. Ron Paul's awesome, but I wanna explain to people.
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:27.820]  Don't be disillusioned. This is what I said when I said you gotta run for president again.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.820]  We're drafting you. Remember a year and a half ago? Remember Rand Paul? I talked to
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:32.140]  him off air and on air.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:37.420]  I'm like, you've really gotta run. Well, that's why I'm coming on your show to see if there's
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:42.260]  interest. Okay, where's the exploratory website? Folks, give them money. And it was the money
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:47.780]  our audience on record gave him up front that made Rand Paul realize he could get the money
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:48.780]  and he needed.
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:54.260]  It was our listeners on record that went and formed the core of his volunteers. And that's
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:59.140]  why a lot of Rand Paul's people came right out of this audience. That's why Ron Paul,
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:03.700]  four years ago, four plus years ago, right before the New Hampshire primary, out of the
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:07.060]  blue on my show, said I wanna thank your audience.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:11.780]  They've been half of our support. I mean, you look at Ron Paul on TV, he's always signing
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:17.240]  Infowars shirts, signing Infowars bumper stickers. He's always, people are photographed with
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:23.340]  Infowars bracelets on. Ron Paul knows that. He knows that half his support stills this
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.340]  radio show.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:29.460]  So this radio show is a big giant secret. It's not a secret to those that are awake.
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:33.520]  It's not a secret to those that listen. But the establishment media has always tried to
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.780]  ignore the show like it didn't exist. Even though we have a bigger audience in most cases
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:45.860]  than they do. See, it's all about the pageantry. It's all about the show.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:53.000]  It's all about makeup and perfect ties and perfect teleprompters and someone looking
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.780]  convincing when they talk to you. You know when these teleprompters, when they talk about
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:06.420]  a kid that's died, they tell them, look concerned. Or when they talk about Ron Paul, it'll say,
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:09.920]  look disgusted.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:13.720]  And these people act like they know what they're talking about. They get there 20 minutes before,
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.980]  their makeup's all on. They go in and they just sit there and try to look official. I
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:24.300]  mean, John Bounds worked in TV stations around the country. He'll tell you that, people show
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.300]  up.
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:30.720]  They spend hours in there watching TV, listening to radio, playing around, putting makeup on.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:35.440]  They come right out and read the teleprompter and sit there and act like they've got emotions
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.340]  and like they care about what you're saying and what you're doing. And it's the Emperor's
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:44.940]  new clothes. You know that whole parable, he's all dressed up in these fancy outfit.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:50.280]  And he's really wearing no clothes at all. But because everyone says, look how beautiful
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:55.140]  his cloak is, no one wants to admit he's actually butt naked in the parade until a two-year-old
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.740]  steps up and laughs and says, the Emperor's naked.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:02.260]  And then somebody else laughs, and then somebody else laughs. All we gotta do is call these
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:07.620]  crooks ridiculous bluff. All right, I gotta hurry through calls now. Angie in North Carolina,
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620]  welcome.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:15.100]  Hi, Alice. It's a pleasure to speak to you again. You spoke to me recently and interviewed
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:22.420]  my husband about the blue forest situational awareness that they're setting up under the
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:28.220]  continuity programs. I wanted to call and connect some really important thoughts that
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:32.380]  are floating around out there for people. First, I wanted to give you what I think might
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:37.800]  be a solution to your mainstream media moniker dilemma. And I think you should call them
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:40.380]  exactly what they are. They're the mainstream mafia.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:44.420]  They are, yeah. That's a good name.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:52.820]  Yeah. Okay. In late fall, around late October, early November last year, right around the
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:46:00.020]  time of the holidays, a recommendation came out by the National Biodefense Science Board,
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:09.340]  which is under Health and Human Services. And they recommended that we not just revisit
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:16.100]  the issue, they recommend that we actually begin to test anthrax vaccines on the pediatric
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:17.100]  population.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:23.860]  Yeah, I forgot to cover that. Guys, will you type in government wants to test anthrax vaccine
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:28.980]  on children or wants to give anthrax vaccine to children? That was in the news last week.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:32.460]  I didn't even cover it. It was in the Associated Press. And for those that don't know, they
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:38.220]  had to suspend it twice cuz it was killing the troops. And so yes, now the American Medical
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:44.700]  Association says they wanna start forcing vaccines, including experimental, on the public.
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:45.700]  Go ahead.
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:51.380]  My husband has actually had that vaccine. He was in the first Desert Storm. And he's
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:57.060]  got residual problems from that vaccine. He's got problems with his memory and all kinds
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:04.180]  of issues. And so does, by the way, a friend of ours who's a minister who they were over,
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.340]  him and his wife were over for dinner last night.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:10.380]  He's also had that vaccine and he's also got issues as a result of it.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:14.380]  Yeah, well, I'm sorry to tell you it's a soft kill. It's meant that after a veteran served
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:18.480]  their time to be debilitating, but there's ways to try to reverse it. I've had medical
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.080]  doctors on. There were actual court-martials that began, as you know, in Denver and other
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.680]  areas when their own doctors said, look, I just gave 100 people this shot.
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:33.660]  One of them died, five are having convulsions, something's wrong. And they said, put them
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:38.620]  in irons. And again, then they said, you've gotta follow orders to take the shot. You
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:43.100]  have to take the shot if you're in the military if it's an approved, confirmed vaccine. But
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.900]  under law, you cannot force a experimental shot on troops.
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:51.740]  And it turns out they were using them as guinea pigs, as you know. Go ahead.
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:57.860]  Right. Now, that recommendation came out and some websites wrote articles about it. There
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:05.300]  was an article in Science Insider on October 28th. And a quote from this article is, even
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:10.900]  if this study goes forward, it'll have to jump through hoops because a trial like this
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:17.580]  is without precedent and involves giving children a vaccine. This is a quote that's almost certain
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.260]  not to benefit them and that might harm them all to protect-
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:27.260]  But it's about setting the precedent to even give boys an MMR shot that killed girls in
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:31.700]  the trials and kills them now and doesn't protect you from the papillomavirus, the insert
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:36.700]  says. In fact, we found the article, let's put it on screen. This is from medical news
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.700]  today.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.220]  Federal government wants to test anthrax vaccine on children. I'm sorry, ma'am, go
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:43.220]  ahead.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:50.220]  Yeah, what they're looking to do is the scientists are salivating for the data that they ethically
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:56.140]  cannot gather. That's what they want to do. It's not about protecting anybody from a ridiculously
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.140]  unlikely-
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:02.020]  Ma'am. Ma'am, you know what's going on. I mean, anybody can look this up. Until three
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:07.700]  years ago, every doctor, every nurse was trained. Everyone knew you don't give a pregnant woman
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:13.340]  vaccines. It's been proven to cause deformities, health problems, and miscarriages.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:18.520]  Now instead they flip it and say, pregnant women are who you want to give all the shots
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.900]  and it's killing them. They're testing bold in your face, killing us and getting away
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.900]  with it. Go ahead.
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:33.140]  Well the President Obama with the passage of an executive order number 13521 on November
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:41.180]  24th of 2009, he established the bioethics committee. Now the bioethics committee, first
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:48.380]  of all, the website is bioethics.gov and it's a treasure trove of information if you guys
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:54.140]  have time to comb through it. There's transcriptions on the sites of all the meetings they've had
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:50:00.360]  so far and meetings they've got coming up about all kinds of unbelievable things such
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:07.100]  as meeting for session 10, they talked about testing directed energy weapons on the population
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:14.100]  and I think it's kind of a test situation to find out what the population knows about
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:21.260]  certain things. But on November, I'm sorry, on January 6th, Kathleen Sebelius submitted
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:28.340]  a letter. Now if you go to the news section under bioethics.gov, on January 11th, I believe
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:34.820]  it was, they posted the blog about a January 6th letter that came from Kathleen Sebelius.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:41.580]  And in this letter, she asked them to convene a panel. Do you want to take this break?
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:45.900]  Yeah, we'll get a break and come back with that. Yeah, for those that don't know, bioethics
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:50.540]  is really just eugenics. And they claim it's the ethics of science. Well, we have the Hippocratic
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:56.020]  Oath. They've gotten rid of the Hippocratic Oath and that basically it's the death panels.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:51:00.660]  We'll be right back. It's these quasi-governmental boards. Stay with us.
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:07.700]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:12.940]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:19.740]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats. But we can't do that without
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:25.740]  your help. By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake

[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:38.100]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:45.340]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:53.020]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:52:02.540]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. Big Berkey Water Filters

[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:16.900]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:26.740]  But nobody wants to know him. They can see that he's just a fool. And he never gives
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:33.820]  an answer, but the fool. I mean, here's another article. I just typed in anthrax vaccine children.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:41.980]  And look at this headline, major drug maker accused of killing 14 trial suspects. Suspects,
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:46.780]  I guess the children are suspects to be killed, subjects. And there's a CNN report, Argentina
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:54.100]  finds drug company over vaccine deaths and of course it's vaccine company coming at you
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.480]  with the anthrax shots.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.700]  The Nuremberg Code provides ethical guidelines for medical research to protect human test
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:07.940]  subjects and scientific experiments from injury, disability or death, but our government violates
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:12.460]  that. I mean, they do it on foster kids, ladies and gentlemen. When you learn that you're
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:17.620]  seen as lab rats, literally, and that you're seen as scum and trash by the ruling class
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:21.580]  and this is all a big medical experiment, the whole thing, the TV, the fluoride in the
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:24.200]  water, the GMO, the drugging of school kids.
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:29.860]  When you wake up to just how horrifying it is and you learn that they're setting up these
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:34.580]  death panels, that they're telling doctors what health care you can give people. Bill
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:39.980]  Gates admits this. Newsweek says the case for killing granny and shows granny being
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:45.180]  unplugged. And now they're gonna have the Federal Bioethics Board coming out and saying,
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:49.420]  yes, we're just gonna give your kids shots whether you like it or not.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:54.620]  This is an assault, but they've learned to slow kill you. They just shoot you up, screw
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:59.740]  you up, and kind of walk off giggling. This is how the creepy technocrats hit you and
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:03.740]  hit you hard. I need to get to other callers, Angie, but finishing up your point about this,
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:04.740]  go ahead.
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:10.660]  Right. Well, so Kathleen Sebelius wrote this letter on January 6th asking this Bioethics
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:18.260]  Commission to convene a board to review basically how to get around the ethical issues with
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:26.380]  testing this anthrax vaccine on children. And she also recommends that they gather pre
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:36.260]  and post trial information. So she wants them to give her ways to get around the ethical
[01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:42.900]  problems with testing the AVA, which is the anthrax vaccine absorbed in the pediatric
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:46.220]  population. And by the way, it doesn't even prevent them from getting sick if there's
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:51.820]  an anthrax attack. This is actually, it's not a vaccine, it's more a treatment for what
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:59.020]  they call post-exposure prophylaxis, which means that it will stop certain symptoms after
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.980]  exposure to the anthrax virus.
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:06.460]  But see, they've got a beta test just killing the kids out in the open. I mean, the dead
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:10.860]  mount, the cancer mounts, leading the world in every disease now. And they just sit there
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.540]  with straight faces going, we love you, we love you, we love you, I appreciate your call.
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:19.900]  It's good to hear from you and the great work you guys are doing, God bless. We're gonna
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:24.660]  go to break for one minute and come back with a short five-minute segment, and then Catherine
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.660]  Albrecht's our guest.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:29.940]  But we're gonna go to Tony, Julio, John, and Mouse, and everybody else that's holding.
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:34.780]  I'll get to everybody, but I'll get to a few of those calls in the next segment. I've covered
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:37.780]  some of the news, there's still a lot of it I've got to go over. I'm gonna throw some
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:41.860]  of this news at Catherine Albrecht and get her take on it. She'll be with us at the five
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:42.860]  after.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:49.780]  Briefly, knowledge is power and it's important to expose false flag terror, a noble lie Oklahoma
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:55.460]  City 1995 is an excellent film available at infoawars.com. Your purchase supports our broadcast
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:58:00.260]  as well. The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Iserby back in print, excellent
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:04.700]  to give all educators you know, so they understand why they're not allowed to truly educate but
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:06.500]  only indoctrinate.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:11.020]  We have the new film Indoctrination as well that goes with it, it's excellent. And Bloodlines,
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:15.460]  the Illuminati, we've got a couple thousand of these and I thought that would last us
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:21.220]  a while. But you better order them before we sell out. Bloodlines Illuminati has been
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:25.740]  out of print for a while and very hard to get. Well, I went ahead and just had a bunch
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:30.020]  of them printed up with the author. So we have them in stock right now. But at the rate
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:34.540]  they're going in three or four days, they might all be gone. Bloodlines Illuminati available

[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:57.380]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.420]  chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:04.060]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:05.060]  at home.
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:10.100]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:11.100]  the shots.
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:15.940]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:21.540]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:26.140]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:30.580]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:32.740]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:38.580]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:39.580]  of the Republic.

[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:12.900]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:21.660]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:40.660]  Okay, Catherine Albrecht, expert on different types of globalist tracking grid is joining
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:41.660]  us.
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:45.460]  We've got some breaking news on the Super Bowl. I'll cover as well. As soon as Kurt's
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:51.400]  got his article done, it'll be up at infoawars.com. We're taking your phone calls right now. Tony
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.740]  in Idaho, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:01:01.540]  All right. Hello, Alex. I was just thinking about the tracking mechanisms that they have
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:07.140]  available. Like for example, they can track you through a lot of driver's license now.
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:12.000]  If God forbid this does turn into a shooting war, it might be a good idea to dump your
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.260]  wallet, so to speak.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:19.700]  Well, all you got to do is fry the RFID chip that are on them. But I mean, in the future,
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:24.100]  you're not gonna buy and sell without your face scan approving it, which is just a digital
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:28.740]  camera. It's going in everywhere, they admit that's their plan. It's always been the plan
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.780]  of this architecture.
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:35.420]  And the big thing is piling fees on every transaction. They're gonna have a global sales
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:40.580]  tax, national sales tax, carbon taxes. So even when you pay cash, you notice now in
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.980]  Louisiana they've banned cash for retail sales. Did you see that last year?
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:50.140]  Oh, man. This is all about control, sir.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:54.940]  Yeah. Well, yeah, that's true. I mean, it's amazing. One of the things I wanted to say
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:02:00.780]  was that in the early 90s, I was with Sam Sherwood's militia in Idaho and one of his
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:05.980]  inner circle. One of the things that was brought to our attention was the method for killing
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:08.500]  heat signature.
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:13.580]  Basically put a space blanket underneath an army poncho. Theoretically, it's supposed
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:17.460]  to kill 90% of your heat signature. God forbid it goes to a shooting where that gives the
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:19.660]  Patriots a hell of an advantage.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:23.380]  No, that's true. They say you can actually take the space blanket and basically show
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:27.380]  it in. There's a lot of other ways to do that. And that's why the globalists are moving
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:33.500]  to drones domestically. I mean, the military has over 20,000 drones, 7,000 plus predators
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:34.500]  alone.
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:38.260]  They're going to the armed systems, the Reapers and others. And they admit they're gonna use
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:43.460]  them domestically against us. Again, an illegitimate criminal government overtaken by foreign banks
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:48.380]  engaging in every crime you can imagine.
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:54.300]  One final thing I'd like to say is that I would suggest that every patriot out there,
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:59.100]  get right with God, get right with Jesus because if he is with you, who could possibly be against
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:00.100]  you?
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:05.080]  Well, I agree with that and also make hay while the sun shines. Reach out to everybody,
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:10.200]  do banner hangs, put info wars.com or other websites on the side of your barn or your
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:16.020]  house or your business or out there on the side in front of your hamburger joint.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:19.980]  Make copies of my film Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic End Game. Give them away free
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:25.340]  at your restaurant or at your grocery store or at your five and dime or at your convenience
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:32.180]  store or sell them. Buy them in bulk and sell them or print up your own pamphlets, hand
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:36.100]  out your own business cards, do banner hangs on the highway.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:42.820]  I mean, there's a lot we can do to really get the word out about what's happening.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:49.980]  Yeah, I loved End Game. I never realized how rotten Charles Darwin really was until I saw
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:50.980]  that.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:54.820]  Well, they took out of what Darwin's whole family was a eugenics family that were all
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:59.260]  interbreeding to create a master race. The Galtons, the Wedgewoods, the Huxleys, all
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:04.820]  of them. And of course, it didn't create a master race within four generations, most
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:08.280]  children were stillborn or seriously mentally retarded.
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:12.060]  But it did create a few idiot savants that did survive because they did originally come
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:17.220]  out of very smart families, but four families all intermarried in the test. And yeah, and
[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:21.660]  they created social Darwinism for eugenics out of it. And they developed a plan for the
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:25.380]  scientific dictatorship. And that's what we're under, brother.
[02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:34.060]  I know, I hear you. And I just wish there was some way people could say, just pick a
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:39.620]  day in which they can all like at noon, just stick their head out a window and just scream,
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.280]  no new Ron Paul or something like that. You know, just make it really known that they
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:50.860]  don't approve of this Newt Gingrich. I mean, you know what I mean, don't you?
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:55.860]  What do you mean don't approve of Newt Gingrich? Absolutely. I can't stand Newt Gingrich. I

[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.880]  the rest of the hour and we also again as I said have your calls there but the
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:27.560]  point is the internet is obviously just a computer communication system but now
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:30.960]  it's being wired into all your appliances your television sets your
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.040]  smartphones and it's controlling the architecture of our technological
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:38.760]  development and these global corporations and governments get
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.920]  together on record and conspire to make you pay for Trojan horse surveillance
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:51.320]  systems in the products you purchase and we've gone from government denying that
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:57.680]  they're spying on us to now just saying yeah we're spying on everything I mean
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:00.600]  you know take Pennsylvania a few years ago people didn't believe that when it
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:04.840]  first came out in the mainstream news oh yeah the school announced and titled on
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:09.080]  themselves the laptops the free laptops that taxpayers pay for nothing's free
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:12.320]  that we sent home with you we're watching you in the shower we're
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:18.960]  watching you in your bed we're watching you at home we're watching you and they
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.800]  sent the police after some kid because they were eating skittles and thought
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:26.960]  they were pills so government is announcing more and more on itself and
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:32.000]  the big issue is the plan is face scanning thumb printing to buy and sell
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.680]  part of national and global sales taxes VAT and carbon tax this is all announced
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.600]  and then they're gonna add fines and fees and other rags you think five bucks
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:46.000]  use your smart cards bad for Bank of America or your debit card just wait
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.980]  everything with RFID everything face scanned by law look at Louisiana saying
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:55.920]  you can't use cash and secondhand transactions all of you are criminals
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:59.360]  you've got to go to a big-box store cracking down the lemonade stands the
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  Girl Scout cookies arresting people selling lemonade arresting kids playing
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:09.320]  tag arresting kids for running on the schoolyard just type it into the search
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:15.160]  engine folks and you will see Associated Press going you know is it good to
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:19.240]  arrest five-year-olds for running on the playground I showed it to you last hour
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:24.160]  this is really happening and on the backs of all of this just out today
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:28.800]  London Guardian Thailand backs Twitter censorship policy the government becomes
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.960]  first to publicly endorse Twitter's decision to permit country-specific
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.040]  censorship of content so the West wants to overthrow their old dictator in Egypt
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:42.040]  or another dictator like Assad in Syria oh they're all for the rebels that are
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:45.960]  CIA funded on record I'm not saying I like Syria I'm like saying I like Hazi
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:51.600]  Mubarak the point is is it's selective they let them use it but then and
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:55.280]  criticize Mubarak for shutting it down but everywhere else they're saying
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.080]  they're gonna shut it down we've already seen cell phones in San Francisco shut
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:02.160]  down during protests so nobody can take photos or shoot video we're already
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.320]  seeing calls for this here Google's announcing they're gonna be helping
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:09.760]  people censor over the web they're announcing you have no privacy now
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:12.480]  they're gonna integrate all this Catherine all of its gonna be breaking
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.560]  it down with us here's another one act is worse than SOPA here's what you need
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:23.280]  to know and it breaks down the fact this global treaty that Obama has now signed
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.680]  and and and Homeland Security is involved in all of that so it's all
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:33.280]  rolling out with the troops on the streets the surveillance the cashless
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:38.520]  society that is about shutting you down if you're not a good globalist shutting
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:43.080]  down black markets once you've had your bank account shut down it's all about
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.480]  targeting everyone it's all about a managed controlled economy and dr.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.240]  Catherine Albrecht joins us to break this down I mean Catherine what we're
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:56.480]  seeing is everything come out in the open from the NDAA to the wars to the
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:02.000]  torture to the police state we are seeing the censorship come out in the
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.800]  open we're seeing the fact that al-qaeda is being protected and put in power in
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:11.200]  Libya by Western powers everything is pretty much coming out right now that's
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.240]  panicking the system in this open free information society the the mainstream
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:21.280]  media is dying so it's a perfect storm of the old dying media and corrupt
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:25.640]  governments knowing that we're awake to them wanting now to try to put the genie
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:30.000]  back in the bottle and their attempt to shut down our free speech has really I
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.080]  think backfired Catherine Albrecht thank you for joining us hey it's great to be
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:37.400]  on Alex and you totally hit the nail on the head in fact this whole thing out of
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:42.120]  Thailand they actually wanted to put an all-out block on all social media from
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:46.280]  the West and we're citing China is a good example to follow so obviously of
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:50.600]  Thailand and China and Iran I know you reported on this a couple years ago when
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.320]  it happened when they had those riots in the street and we're shooting protesters
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:57.560]  they told all the journalists get lost we don't want any journalist in here
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.720]  they cordoned it off and people were taking photos posting them on the web
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:06.320]  from their smartphones and getting right around that so that's why they want to
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:11.260]  put these kind of filters on to all of these websites and those countries they
[02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:15.880]  come out and say it openly you know you look at China and you say all right well
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:19.760]  China is going to come right out and say you have no freedom you can't just do
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:24.160]  whatever you want North Korea is a perfect example and what you're pointing
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:28.280]  out is that our government now is starting to do the same thing the things
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:31.720]  that used to be whispered about and considered conspiracy theory are now
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:36.400]  openly published they're open statements they're open policies same thing is true
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:40.280]  obviously with the search engines you've got you know Google and Yahoo and Bing
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.560]  which for years if you were over in Beijing and you typed in Tiananmen
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.800]  Square because you wanted to find out about the massacre but you were behind
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:51.800]  the walls of China you would not get those search engines would actually
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:56.080]  censor your results and and only show you happy families picnicking in the
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:00.600]  park and so from behind that iron wall of China you could not even discover
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:04.400]  that there had been a massacre why because all the information that we get
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.120]  nowadays we're getting through the search engines we're getting through
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:12.160]  these big companies and all it takes is for one government to get three or four
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.680]  of them to say it yeah we'll all get on board and we'll shut down and censor
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.240]  your information and we could be to back to the dark ages I mean we could be
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.840]  worse than Soviet Stalin Soviet Union where there was only one source of
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:30.040]  information notice Russia is now endorsing a bunch of internet censorship
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:34.960]  so all these governments you know who are more and more getting exposed they
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.920]  have a dog in the fight wanting to curtail like I said the old dinosaur
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:42.920]  prostitute media they're hopping up and down supporting it because they want to
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.800]  see their competition shut down and and and as we go into this world depression
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:52.560]  the the system is going to try to start shutting down the web it may mean
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.760]  Homeland Security launches a false flag against the web and says foreign
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:00.440]  terrorists have done it you know they've said during a flu outbreak they may shut
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.200]  down the whole web and only direct you to White House website where you get a
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:09.920]  message so they can control information during emergencies or during a new war
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:15.400]  the point is they're openly trying to sell this idea of censorship now not
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:19.340]  just of the internet but of talk radio Cass Sunstein the regulations are as you
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:23.520]  know Katherine has called for censoring people that don't believe in man-made
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:29.920]  global warming I mean they are really authoritarians and I think it's starting
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:34.080]  to backfire on them that they're being so obvious yeah I think so too and you
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.080]  know I was just talking to my show recently about this this article that
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:41.640]  came out should Google take the crazy off of the internet and somebody
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:45.040]  actually came out and said with a straight face that and this was like in
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:48.760]  Forbes so you know this is this is not just some guy's blog but came out and
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:54.160]  said we really think that Google should start flagging websites that don't meet
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:58.200]  basic criterion of accepted scientific fact and they were talking about
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:02.280]  creation websites they were talking about 911 truth websites they were
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:06.520]  talking about Obama birth certificate concern websites and you know political
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.920]  type issues and saying that first Google should start off by putting a little
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.120]  flag and saying these are not you know vetted by Google or these are not
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:18.160]  approved websites or these are crazy websites and then of course your next
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:21.360]  step I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see your next step from
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.880]  that is going to be saying well let's just make sure those aren't even there
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:29.200]  and all that I mean Google's already delisted us two years ago from their
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.760]  Google News function we're just got you guys got kind of some screwage there on
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.000]  YouTube to not long ago we've had it all sorts of stuff I mean Paul Watson's been
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.080]  in areas of Europe and in England and they have the government free Wi-Fi the
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:48.080]  train stations info wars in prison planet has a notice this is extreme
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:52.600]  you're not allowed to go there unbelievable so yeah and and this is why
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:56.280]  you know the the last the last week of course last week Google made its big
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.440]  announcement that it's going to take all of its products all 60 of its privacy
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:04.720]  policy 60 plus privacy policies consolidate them into one and you know
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:09.140]  you look around and I'm just working on an essay called when did Google become a
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:14.840]  verb you know we we are all unthinkingly logging on to this website and doing
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:18.640]  much more than we realize we're doing by using these services I I have some
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:21.360]  friends who are in the privacy movement who are in the freedom movement who use
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:25.240]  Google Voice I'm like dudes have you read the privacy policy do you realize
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:29.840]  that that that service is recording every phone call you make every one of
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:36.040]  your calls email it means that they read your email and store it you got it so so
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:40.500]  this is this I think it's interesting this is a good time and I I know
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:43.080]  everybody says what are you talking about Catherine it's the worst but I say
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:46.640]  this is a good time because this is the first time Alex that the kinds of things
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:49.760]  you and I have been talking about and I know you even go back before I do
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:53.080]  because you were one of the folks who helped wake me up back in 1999 when I
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:56.680]  became an advocate so you know those of us who've been saying this for over a
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:02.920]  decade you know we we are now no longer people crying in the wilderness we are
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:07.240]  now the mainstream we are now the people saying hey all of you out there who are
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.920]  concerned about this this is what we've been talking about all along and wake up
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:15.000]  and they're waking up in in droves so you know this whole Google thing and is
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.640]  as your listeners probably know I work with start page start page calm which is
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.400]  the private alternative to Google you know looking at what the internet is all
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:27.280]  about right now and saying okay how do we support alternatives how do we get
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:31.200]  alternatives like start page you know that that serves you Google results
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:35.000]  without the tracking how do we do that for everything and you know we're

[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:09.640]  all right right back to privacy expert dr. Catherine Albrecht short segment
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.640]  long segment coming up Catherine this is a short seg you've got the floor here
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:18.240]  what are some of the other threats we see developing and and the unification
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.480]  of how all these spy systems are tied in together well you know the internet
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:27.480]  Alex's is anybody who's been watching it for the last 15 years has become the
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:32.120]  backbone of virtually everything we do and you know it's not just the internet
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:35.160]  it's the fact that our phone calls are now being routed through it you've got
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:39.680]  lots of people using voice over IP you've got essentially this data cloud
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:43.920]  that's also being created and all of the stuff that we do is about to wind up on
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.000]  the internet and I think that's why like Google's announcement is so interesting
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.260]  because Sergei Brin back in the founding of Google or after the founding of
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:54.360]  Google a couple years ago was asked you know what do you envision Google
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:57.620]  becoming you know what's the ultimate search engine and his answer was like
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:01.920]  the mind of God and you know you put all that together and you say okay so we are
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.680]  creating essentially and you and I've talked about this before in the show
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:11.520]  we're creating a kind of a backbone or a nervous system across this planet and
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.320]  I've said this before it's not accidental that we call it the net you
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:19.320]  know net traps things it's not accidental we call it a web because a
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:22.880]  web traps things we are creating if you could stand in outer space and see all
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.800]  of the interconnected links of information flow across this planet it
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:30.920]  would look an awful lot like a net or a web and the things that ultimately are
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:35.800]  going to be caught in that are us and so as these things consolidate you know I
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:40.800]  was just rereading 1896 King Camp Gillette what a name his parents named
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:46.200]  him King the guy who created the Gillette razor company and came up he
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:50.000]  was the first by the way back in 1896 back in the 1800s he was the first guy
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.600]  to come up with a disposable consumer product which is fascinating to me
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:56.600]  because now virtually everything you buy is disposable and that was he was the
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:59.880]  guy who created that prior to that everybody had a straight razor and they
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.240]  sharpened it with a strop and you get one when you came of age you make it
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:06.080]  another one when you got married and that was it for life you had one razor
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:10.000]  and so he came up with this disposable concept that now has polluted our whole
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.200]  our whole planet but one of the things that he was working on back then was
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:19.880]  this idea that left to its own devices capitalism was going to lead to one
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.880]  single store one single manufacturer for everything he was basically talking
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:28.440]  about communism socialism you know the central control and when I was looking
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:31.960]  at that I was thinking well so that's Walmart you know back in 1896 this
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:36.640]  Gillette guy was predicting Walmart well he didn't have the ability to do it yet
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:41.080]  but he could have been predicting Google because it's the same concept you've got
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:45.360]  in the same way that Walmart is like how people buy stuff nowadays and has the
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:49.480]  power to snuff out other companies and eliminate competition and you know I
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:54.040]  reported on this a couple years ago in England some commentator on the on the
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:57.480]  supermarket industry said England is too big for three supermarkets we're gonna
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.480]  have to get it down to two and eventually one so everything's moving to
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:06.120]  this hugeness consolidation and we're gonna start seeing the same thing on the
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:09.000]  internet we're already seeing it you know I remember back in the 90s when I
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.080]  was a graduate student at Harvard and we were like the first people to ever use
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.000]  the internet it was new it was not graphical it was all text it was you
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  know hard to navigate and we were like how cool you know there's a million
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.160]  people on here and they're all doing their own thing now you go on the
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:27.560]  internet and virtually everything is under these couple of few umbrellas as
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.400]  you well know so that's why I think alternative radio I think supporting
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:35.960]  infowars supporting what I'm doing over at my radio show at Catherine Albrecht
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.160]  dot-com supporting all of the alternative sources of news is going to
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:43.980]  be crucial and in the same way when you start looking and again I think the
[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:48.440]  reason everybody got scared about this Google announcement is all of a sudden
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:52.440]  you've got them pulling tight the range it's like the net was sort of loosely
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:55.520]  kind of being built around us we didn't realize it and now they're pulling it
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:59.320]  and that was always the plan make it ubiquitous get it into everything
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:03.960]  standardized the TVs everything where they're plugged in the smart meter
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:09.920]  spying on what you're doing in your house off of algorithms I mean it's all
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:15.120]  now just suddenly admitted and then Google says we're gonna integrate all
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:20.400]  the platforms we have and share what you're doing with everyone and Schmidt
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:23.460]  comes out and says you shouldn't be doing it if you don't want people to
[02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:27.400]  know well wait a minute I closed my blinds at night because I want privacy
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:31.440]  or I don't want the sunlight coming in it doesn't mean I should live in a glass
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:37.640]  house because you say so and he operated for 12 years like don't be evil we'll
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:42.520]  always keep your data secret we've never had a data breach we promise we won't do
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:48.240]  that and now they're going you know what we are evil we always planned it we're
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:53.420]  taking over and it just shows like I said a few weeks ago when SOPA I was
[02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:57.240]  getting shot down I said that's good but it's only because the big mega global
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:01.520]  us like Google they're already going to implement a global model through Davos
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:05.720]  and other systems they don't want governments ham-fisted ly doing it they
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:10.160]  don't want the recording industry coming in with something that screws up their
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:14.720]  more subtle ways to phase in censorship they're like wait a minute don't run off
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:18.920]  all the geese we're gonna put them all in one big net and catch all of them not
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:23.760]  shoot one with a shotgun recording industry shut up you idiots sit down
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:27.360]  we're gonna show you how you censor we're gonna show you how it's done

[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.360]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is

[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:44.840]  to control your life who will give billions of dollars to their buddies
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:49.840]  companies to never build a single you know alternative energy system because
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:54.160]  they never intended to who will shut down power plants in your area so their
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:59.040]  power plant that's in with the government will make ten times the money
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:04.240]  where they'll shut down a pipeline bringing us oil show that Warren Buffett
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:09.520]  can ship it by train to the coast to send it to China and then Warren Buffett
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.560]  pays the news media on record Aaron was pointing this out to me yesterday to put
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:19.080]  out PR stories about what a philanthropist he is when he actually put
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:24.440]  his money in a tax-free foundation and makes money off of it and they're buying
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:30.800]  up big pharma companies vaccines Bill Gates is involved with him it is beyond
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:37.360]  out of control and internet to going back 12 years ago this consortium would
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:43.400]  meet and admit it's gonna be big business academia and government they're
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:47.080]  gonna control the new internet and they're gonna make you sign agreements
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:50.840]  to be on their platforms and they can shut you down anytime they want it's the
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:57.160]  privacy agreements it's the terms of use and they own what you're doing you waive
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:03.800]  all your rights and the old web is just shut down now a way to boil it down is
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:08.360]  you're about net neutrality where companies say you've got to pay us to go
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:10.600]  over our routers even though you're already paying for the internet
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:15.760]  connection so this is about getting the whole world economy wired into this
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:20.080]  letting it be free for a while and then coming in and taking it over it's like
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:25.760]  toll road companies letting you build big
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.200]  highways with taxpayer money the gas tax is paying for it all they call it
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:33.440]  privatization but it's not really they hand it over even though it's still
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:38.600]  government financed to a private management company that then puts a new
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:42.840]  lane on it with paint and technically says well now we're allowed to put a
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:47.480]  toll road on it even though the laws say you can't toll existing roads so they're
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:51.200]  just hijacking our infrastructure this is what the IMF and World Bank have done
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.400]  in the third world it's now coming here look at the austerity in Europe look at
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:36:03.960]  Europe signing on to this new internet censorship treaty the actor look at how
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:07.600]  they're announcing that they're gonna raise everybody's taxes to quote pay off
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:15.280]  the debt but most the debt isn't even the people's own debt the debt is
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:22.920]  incurred by the mega banks Catherine does it ever make your head spin just to
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:28.760]  see the enormity of this planned economy unfolding it is it can be a little
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:32.680]  overwhelming doesn't it it can leave you a little bit stunned and you know I
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:36.960]  always try to encourage people though because it can be so easy to just say ah
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:41.240]  it's it's too much we can't fight back there's nothing we can do and then I
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:44.280]  take a look and one of the things that's really encouraged me in the last
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:49.400]  probably decade or so has been the the natural foods market you know just just
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:53.280]  organic foods if you just think about that alone and obviously that's just one
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:57.520]  tiny little sliver but there was a time you know 10-15 years ago when those of
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:59.760]  us who were saying wait a minute they're putting all this garbage and there's
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.800]  hydrogenated vegetable oil and corn syrup and it's all in our food and
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:08.520]  everybody's getting sick and then little by little the activists the people
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:12.280]  telling their friends the listeners like your listeners sending emails and in
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.560]  distributing your information getting the word out created a grassroots
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.560]  movement that is now made the organics market the the fastest moving food
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.800]  market in the country today so obviously that's just one sliver but I encourage
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.120]  people not to give up and not to lose heart because there are projects that
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:32.160]  people have been working on for you know three four years and they say it's not
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:35.200]  getting anywhere we're not getting any traction and then you look up and you
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:39.800]  go wait a minute whoo things are changing so don't don't lose hope and I
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:42.880]  think the key thing and this is why I think the internet is where this whole
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:47.720]  fight really comes together you know you can talk agenda 21 you can talk toll
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.160]  roads you can talk North American Union you can talk all this stuff but where
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:56.160]  where the crux really is is this internet this ability to communicate
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:00.440]  because if they can shut that off if they can keep us from communicating if
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:04.480]  they can censor watch and filter us and make sure that you can't even log on to
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:08.600]  send an email without a thumbprint that puts you through some FBI computer that
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:13.160]  makes sure you're pre-approved if we can't communicate with each other at
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:18.440]  that point then anything they want to do is going to be doable so the key and
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:22.600]  and this is why I'm such a huge supporter of your radio program it's why
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:29.400]  I do radio it's why I encourage people you start page calm get a private email
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:35.080]  address pay attention because and don't just fall into the easiness trap you
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.000]  know it's really easy to just flip on and listen to you know whatever
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:43.240]  mainstream media is blathering out on your car radio if you don't take the
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:46.960]  time to try to find some real radio it's really easy to just use whatever
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.040]  default search engine is on your browser which is going to be Google it's simple
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:56.280]  it's hard to say let me find Alex Jones let me listen to Catherine Albrecht let
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:00.960]  me find start page.com let me let me make those switches and the thing I'm
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:04.080]  liking it too Alex do you remember back when there was really nothing but
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:08.200]  Microsoft Word that's all you had was just Microsoft and everybody all of a
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:13.800]  sudden started typing in Times New Roman 12-point font like overnight like
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.880]  everybody just use that one font because those were the default settings and this
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:23.040]  is kind of a phrase that I use a lot just just in my own work is I think
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:26.520]  alright what are the default settings are the default setting is what you're
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:29.720]  always talking about the with different language you know you're born you go to
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:33.920]  K through 12 you do 12,000 hours of public school government school seat
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.160]  time to be indoctrinated and then you go and you go to your college or your
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:42.840]  whatever job and then you retire and you pay your taxes and that's the end of you
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:46.600]  and and meanwhile you're being watched controlled manipulated and used and
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:50.480]  that's the default setting other people are finding ways to switch that off
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:54.720]  let's homeschool our kids let's you know let's take an alternative way of getting
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:57.520]  through the education system let's take an alternative way of finding out
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:00.880]  information let's find an alternative way searching the internet or sending
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:05.320]  email or making phone calls or whatever it is and it's really turning off those
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:09.160]  default settings and being conscious about it and let me tell you people are
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:13.520]  ready that's why and that's the secret is it is an alternative organic foods an
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:17.680]  alternative and that's the secret because sure 15 years ago you couldn't
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:21.760]  find organic food anywhere people put pressure on the system and so it created
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:27.440]  an economy now the establishment has created subgroups and clones of craft
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:32.480]  and the rest of it that masquerade as true organic but people now get wise to
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:36.360]  that I mean this is an ongoing fight and it's the same thing with the
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:42.480]  standardization at Disney World or SeaWorld or now to get library books to
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:46.640]  biometrically scan you we've just got to learn to say no because once that
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:50.680]  standardized now they're going to do it where you have to do that to buy and
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:56.040]  sell in their own words so they can put taxes and regulations on you like the
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:01.040]  five dollars to use your ATM card at Bank of America they were gonna set the
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:06.600]  standard industry-wide but had to back off take SOPA that shows the power we've
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:10.840]  got and where we really learn how much the system really wants the power grab
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:15.600]  is in what they always ask for up front take about a year ago the cybersecurity
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.080]  command already in place and running under North comps admitted we want all
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:24.640]  IT professionals certified by the federal government remember and working
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:29.920]  for us and even small internet companies and small towns we have to have our hubs
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:33.800]  in there you have to work for us you have to sign all these agreements I mean
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:39.400]  they want a total authoritarian control grid and let's not forget Google
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:46.600]  Microsoft especially but Yahoo all of them Sun Microsystems Cisco they helped
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:51.280]  build the great electronic firewall of China they helped build what's going in
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:55.560]  worldwide they know how to censor and so they're now attempting this so people
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:02.160]  better use the free web to fight for its future but to also fight like it's not
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:06.600]  going to be here you see folks everything is accelerating in this phase
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:12.240]  everything is quickening right now the wars the tyranny the checkpoints the TSA
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:15.400]  and now announcing they're gonna be in the airport parking lots I told you
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:19.600]  first be at the concourse you know then in the parking lots now at your shopping
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:23.760]  malls that's starting they're gonna be at the Super Bowl groping people they're
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:28.560]  training your local police highway checkpoints I mean it's all here it's
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:34.400]  all happening and Catherine what do you see unfolding as this awakening
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:38.720]  accelerates and the tyrants realize we're waking up and try to rush in to
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.440]  block us and accelerate their incremental plan well you know we have
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:46.400]  an interesting window right now Alex because we have more ability to organize
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:50.600]  and communicate now than any people at any time in the past ever in all of
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:54.640]  human history and I think that the the is you call them the globalists the
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:58.760]  people who want to shut all this down they are hoping beyond hope that we do
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:02.640]  not actually collectively recognize the power that we have before they can get
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:06.280]  rid of it I really do believe that that is no that's it exactly we either
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:11.280]  recognize our power and use it or be slaves in a technocratic technotronic
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:17.040]  system that they they call it a a scientific dictatorship they call it an
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:21.600]  authoritarian system The Economist magazine Newsweek time every day I see
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:25.240]  articles where the establishment mouthpieces are saying Catherine
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:30.120]  tyranny is good the experts are gonna run things that won't be a Mussolini or
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:34.760]  a Hitler and a clown outfit it's gonna be ruled by these corporate globalist
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:38.220]  bureaucrats let me let me get your take on that but then I want to give you some
[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:42.080]  Bill Gates news Oh Bill Gates news all right well I'm always up for that because
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:46.560]  he's an interesting character in player and all of this yeah the the the key
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.960]  thing and again I keep coming back to the same point we've got to take the
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:54.540]  tools that we have and hang on to them with both hands kicking and screaming to
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:57.880]  not let go of them that's why the whole SOPA protest regardless of whether it
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:01.600]  was the corporate guys doing it I think it sent a message to the general public
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:06.480]  that wait a minute so there is a power game going on and we can use the
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:10.840]  internet to stop something that seems more powerful like you know basically
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:15.680]  Congress so the SOPA thing was a beautiful experience I think for us
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:20.340]  nationally as a nation of people who want freedom to say oh wait a minute so
[02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:23.400]  things can change and I want people to grab a hold of that even if you don't
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.960]  like the companies that did it or the websites that did it doesn't matter the
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:31.400]  reality is that that was a perfect example of the internet coming together
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:34.760]  coalescing and what is the internet basically other than us coming together
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:37.840]  and coalescing collectively putting their foot down and saying heck no
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:41.640]  you're not going to do whatever it is well that's it that's it but the
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:45.880]  internet is even more than that it is the future architecture of commerce and
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:51.160]  of all technological systems it is the integrated high-tech society and they're
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:56.600]  trying to twist the architecture into total control well and this is why I got
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:00.440]  a couple of things I want to recommend people use cash use it or lose it
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:04.880]  because cash is your only anonymous payment method and not only anonymous
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:07.520]  because a lot of people so I don't care people know what I buy doesn't matter
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:13.160]  because your credit card number can be turned off your $50 bill cannot you know
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:15.920]  without a whole lot of whole leather kind of thing going on that everybody's
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:21.320]  going to notice but don't rely so much on these electronic things and notice
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:25.400]  they're already trying to demonize cash they're already trying to get rid of it
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:29.240]  because once they've got you cashless there's no escaping all the fines and
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:33.120]  fees that's right and not only not only the fines fees and taxes and then
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:36.440]  getting their cut of every single thing you do but also the traceability the
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:41.560]  track ability and more importantly their ability to say no so you know you you
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:43.920]  look at some of these insurance companies and they've actually had
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:47.600]  conversations about using your frequent shopper card that's why I got started in
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:50.600]  all this using this the card that you're showing it Safeway or Kroger or
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:55.200]  wherever you're shopping and using it to say you are overweight or you have high
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:59.400]  blood pressure and so you cannot buy these particular items and when you scan
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:02.440]  your card rather than making it discounts it's gonna be the mandatory
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:06.760]  scan of your ID card and we're gonna make you put back all the things on your
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:11.700]  shopping they're already they're already doing stuff like that I saw a case of
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:15.200]  years ago where the guy admitted he drank a six pack of beer every night to
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:20.960]  his doctor and so it was a bizarre story how they then gave him a DWI even though
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:24.840]  he wasn't driving I mean they're now arresting five-year-olds that run on the
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:29.280]  playground Associated Press Catherine yeah I it's it's where we're going so
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:31.800]  if people don't want to live in that kind of world and I think most of us
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:36.000]  don't then you got to say how am I contributing to it and if you're saying
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.640]  if every other word out of your mouth is Google this or Google that if you're
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:42.080]  whipping out your visa credit card to pay for everything you do if you're
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:45.800]  doing all of your purchasing online instead of actually going to real stores
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:49.240]  brick-and-mortar and supporting local businesses if you're going to Walmart
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.680]  every time you need to fill your shopping cart then you are basically
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.840]  contributing to the problem because doing the status quo taking those
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:01.440]  default settings is adding to the problem and we've got to be in mass and
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:04.320]  I know enough people listen to your program that even if just we did this
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:07.480]  we'd have a massive impact because you know I drive up and down the freeways by
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:10.840]  the way in New Hampshire and I see info wars bumper stickers on the back of
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:15.300]  random cars I mean you are everywhere Alex so if the listeners to this radio
[02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:18.520]  program would get a clue and say alright here are some things I'm going to do I'm
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:22.920]  going to start paying cash I'm going to start patronizing local locally owned
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:25.320]  stores even if I have to pay more you know everybody always says oh but
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:28.360]  everything's so cheap at Walmart I see how cheap is your freedom how much are
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:32.140]  you willing to sell that for because I would rather go to a local store and I
[02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:37.600]  do this consciously and spend an extra 50 cents on a $2 item consciously aware
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:42.560]  with total awareness that I'm spending more and I view that 50 cents as me
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:46.480]  putting money to fund the things I believe in and by the way there's so
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:50.760]  much stuff out there a lot of times you can buy stuff at a swap meet or a garage
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:55.960]  sale that's why the headline Fox News last year 15 million dollar fine for
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:01.560]  garage sale they are coming the Forbes asked the question why is there a war
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:04.800]  against lemonade stands because why is there a war against Amish or folks
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:09.320]  selling pecans on the side of the highway because the system this is a
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:14.680]  corporate takeover and they want you under their control is is those little
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:18.320]  sales they may seem little to us but they're a massive part of the economy
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.760]  and those guys want everything you know it's the greed factor I want everything
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:24.720]  you know Google wants all the searches and all the phone calls and all of the
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:27.960]  everything's and you know and by the way I shouldn't single out Google because
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:33.200]  that's kind of not fair it's also Yahoo it is hotmail it is Microsoft and we're
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.240]  almost out of time we're almost out of time speaking of that because I want to
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:39.640]  come back take a few calls for you Catherine here's the Daily Mail forced
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:46.600]  to stand for 24 hours suicide next toxin exposure and explosions inside the
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:52.040]  Chinese factories making iPads for Apple I mean that just shows how how sickening
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:56.120]  Apple is now they pose as trendy liberals now speaking of that here's
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:00.800]  Bill Gates and if you go read the ABC News blog the whole thing is sponsored
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.960]  and they've got a link there that it's paid for by Bill Gates and then the
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:08.800]  articles all tell you how much he loves you when he's on record being a eugenicist
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:12.080]  that says literally kill granny and people don't believe that just type in
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:18.680]  Bill Gates you know calls for death panels now look at this he he is now
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:23.800]  bought into Monsanto big time but look at this London Guardian food crisis
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:28.680]  compromises fight against world hunger warns UN report and it goes in Bill and
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:32.960]  Melinda Gates Foundation they're literally financing the entire news and
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:37.040]  what's said and it's all about how much he wants people to get food but then in
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:41.880]  his real writings and statements he's actually trying to cut the people off I
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:48.000]  mean here's this eugenicist whose dad ran Planned Parenthood financing
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.520]  propaganda that's the opposite of what he really does Catherine this the whole
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:57.120]  food thing huh you know it does come down I mean we can talk information
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.960]  control all we want but in the final analysis it comes down to food I mean it
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:04.680]  does it comes as food water and air you know you cut that off and you you will
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.440]  have a population very quickly doing whatever you want so when Bill Gates
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:12.280]  starts talking about controlling food I start getting super nervous and and when
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:16.480]  he talks about genetically modifying mosquitoes like that's the last thing I
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:19.680]  need is Microsoft you know who can who can barely run an operating system
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:22.220]  releasing a bunch of genetically modified mosquitoes into the
[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:24.960]  environment no thank you you know why they can barely run it it's got so many
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:29.880]  back doors built into its spine you we all think as you point out we're using
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:34.520]  Google we're using Microsoft to no no that's only part of it it's got the
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:38.520]  back door the whole thing is designed to see what you're doing that's right so
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:41.840]  yeah and by the way speaking of Microsoft Linux is your other opt-out
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.000]  check off the the checkbox and get out of the default setting just like start
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:51.740]  pages for Google that's what Linux is for Microsoft yeah stop using Google
[02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:55.160]  we've got to move forward with a boycott and I know they own YouTube I'll

[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:12.480]  extra to make sure I get to most of these calls that have been holding but
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:17.280]  look at this New York Times article the struggle for daily bread the US
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:23.400]  government pays farmers to produce less than half the food they could it's the
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:28.500]  same in other countries GMO is all about controlling the food supply and turning
[02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:33.680]  it into a genetic bio weapon basically that doesn't produce more seeds that
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:37.680]  you've got to continue to purchase from the globalist it's the computer makers
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:41.080]  going in and basically genetically manipulating things and turning it into
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:45.880]  their own products so they can create monopolies here's the New York Times a
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:49.560]  struggle for daily bread the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation now the world's
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:54.680]  principal private funder of agricultural research this is a guy that you know
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:59.800]  wants to release mosquitoes that carry vaccines to force us to take the shots
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:03.640]  he's into weather weapon funding he's the number one funder of that I mean he's
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:09.560]  super creepy and you look at all these other characters that are involved they
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:12.680]  always propagandize about how much they want us to you know have all this
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:16.640]  freedom and how much they love us but meanwhile it's the opposite Catherine
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:23.640]  and it has that has finally figured it out and again you know our parents
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:26.800]  didn't know that in our grandparents didn't know it they saw Walter Cronkite
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:32.200]  on the evening news and it was gospel so that's my point in what has changed that
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:35.760]  and what has created this window for us to know this to actually be able to hear
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:38.480]  what you're saying and understand it believe it and understand that it's true
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:42.200]  and that that is the way the world works this is like this is like unprecedented
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:45.480]  people have always believed the propaganda except for a tiny teeny
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:49.800]  little minority and now you've got the majority getting it and they get it
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:52.400]  because of the internet which is why they're scrambling so much to shut it
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:55.160]  down. Well you know Hillary talked about this instead of Brzezinski last year
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:58.280]  that the public's finally awake to him for the quote first time in history and
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:01.440]  they're losing the info war but expanding on that Catherine we're going
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.040]  to start jamming in some calls here they miscalculated they always knew there'd
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:09.200]  be people resisting them but they thought they just call us conspiracy
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:13.520]  terrorists now many of us have audiences bigger than their organs and it's
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.580]  freaking them out and they miscalculated they miscalculated folks we're in the
[02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:22.080]  fight doesn't mean we're winning but we're in the fight we better fight
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:27.240]  harder get the word out about info wars calm about alternative media about start
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:32.000]  page calm about it all get the word out today Julio in Illinois thanks for
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:40.440]  holding welcome yes hello Alex I got a suggestion US state-run media or US
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:45.800]  corporate media seeing how they're all run by corporations multinational
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:51.400]  corporations all admitting that they support SOPA so it seems perfect it's
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:55.360]  like in China and in North Korea they're state-run television oh they're the
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.920]  they're the monopoly state-run media I mean it turns out most the media
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:03.440]  so-called mainstream media got banker bailout money Catherine remember that oh
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:08.080]  yeah they did and oh it doesn't take much I mean you take a look at like
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:13.100]  who's at the Bilderberg conferences as you report on so efficiently and you
[02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:16.160]  know it's all the media it's it's the mainstream media who's at those events
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:20.200]  you know Google's there they're all there well you know Schmidt was there
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:25.360]  and right after that happened well we got stuff filed on us websites on
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.080]  YouTube taken down and got not just delisted from Google News but they
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:35.560]  lowered our search rankings a week after that ouch yeah okay well you got slapped
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:39.920]  well we had reporters there in his face yeah I think they'd like the ability to
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:45.160]  do that to everybody and see that's the thing even in you know Google started
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:48.480]  off saying don't be evil and Google offers some fantastic products no
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:53.000]  question about it and even if you Google if you trusted them as much as you trust
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:56.800]  your best friend the reality is once everything gets consolidated into a
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:00.920]  single it can always be taken over and it has been almost out of time Catherine

[02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:08.720]  underneath Americans at home tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:13.760]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:18.880]  American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:24.080]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:28.000]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.800]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:35.680]  do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:41.680]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the
[02:59:41.680 --> 02:59:47.600]  Republic on DVD at info wars calm we're watching online right now in super high
[02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:56.200]  quality at prison planet TV coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're
[02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:21.520]  listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network all right going into
[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:25.000]  some overdrive here to jam in at least three more phone calls John Jay and
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:30.760]  mouselink John and then mouselink you're on the air from Florida John thanks for
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:39.080]  holding love what you do keep doing what you're doing I wanted to can you hear me
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:43.280]  Alex yes sir all right I wanted to mention I was watching Fox News the
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:47.120]  other night Sarah Palin was being interviewed and the interviewer was
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:50.920]  talking about Mitt Romney how he was the best candidate to go up against Obama
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:56.760]  and Palin was making a case for Newt Gingrich well we all know Newt Gingrich
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:01.840]  is as corrupt as it comes but she was making a case for him but as she was
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:04.640]  talking she said something very interesting towards the other interview
[03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:12.640]  she says those pundits who are telling them what to do and those elites who
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:18.560]  want them to obey and listen to them and want them to shut the race down and just
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:24.440]  as she said that the interviewer completely cut her off so it is just
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:27.920]  real interesting when you hear something like that on the mainstream media I
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:32.600]  figured you get a kick out of that one well there are different camps and
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:38.800]  Genrich is always been a Democratic operative and so the reason Republicans
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:43.440]  are attacking him isn't because he's such a globalist so is Romney it's that
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:48.120]  he's pretty much always been known this is now coming out as a Democratic Party
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:54.600]  operative and as a globalist you know a deep-cover operative and so it's you
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:59.840]  know the fact is Republicans don't like him he's not even a rhino and so that's
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:04.720]  why they can't stand him because he did sabotage a lot of stuff that they wanted
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:09.760]  back in the 80s and 90s while posing as a conservative he's extremely out of
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:14.600]  control I think the elite are scared of him because he is such an egomaniac they
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:17.700]  don't want somebody who might actually try to be president even though he'd be
[03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:21.840]  evil they want somebody who's more of a puppet like Mitt Romney and that's my
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.880]  analysis of the situation and in a way that's kind of true I mean I'm not
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:30.660]  saying I like Mitt Romney it's just Genrich is dangerous as I've been saying
[03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:34.880]  for years I mean I mean it'd be elite or even scared of him I mean he's a
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:40.520]  psychopath he's dangerous and so that's why they want a rubber stamp puppet
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:43.920]  empty suit like Obama or Romney appreciate the call great points
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:49.480]  mouselink in New York you're on the air so good to speak to you is Catherine
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:54.240]  still on the line she's gone okay I had a couple of questions for her about the
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:59.280]  announcement that Twitter made this week about being able to selectively remove
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:03.800]  tweets based on the country of origin did you yes yes I covered it's in the
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:07.600]  Daily Mail and Associated Press and London Guardian they're just announcing
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.560]  they're gonna censor anytime they want any government request if you you know
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:14.960]  if you're in Thailand and say I don't like the taxes are too high boom your
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:18.160]  accounts gone not just your tweet they're admitting that they're gonna
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:22.120]  censor Twitter is hooked up with a State Department on record Twitter is a
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:26.000]  globalist operation you know we use it but it doesn't mean it'll be there
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.560]  forever we use their big platforms to reach people but we know it's it's all
[03:03:29.560 --> 03:03:34.400]  part of the internet takeover I agree with you I like Twitter a lot you know
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:40.400]  what I think is that we need to sidestep the official systems of communication
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:44.920]  and create alternative technology and what I wish that somebody was talking
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:48.600]  about don't hear anybody mentioning this idea is that we could create a
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:53.040]  peer-to-peer internet based on existing technologies with you know the
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:56.560]  technology that everybody already has in their home was like their Wi-Fi or maybe
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:59.720]  something like WiMax I mean I don't understand why we couldn't daisy chain
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:04.160]  like an internet connection through all of our neighbors stuff stuff like that's
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:09.440]  going to happen but the biggest thing is just going to other sites that aren't
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:14.320]  part of the globalist insider ring and fighting for the freedom of the web
[03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:18.080]  pointing out that it's nothing but a monopolistic takeover taking place and
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.040]  using the web while we've still got it I mean folks please on your Twitter
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:28.440]  Facebook YouTube plug info wars calm and prison planet calm there's a reason
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:33.320]  they're starting more and more to censor us by the way I keep forgetting and I
