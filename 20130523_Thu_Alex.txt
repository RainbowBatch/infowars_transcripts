[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:35.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.040 --> 00:41.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a loaded transmission filled with key information
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.880]  today. We're gonna have in studio, author, Constitution Party presidential candidate,
[00:47.880 --> 00:57.680]  and all around liberty leader. We're going to have here in studio with us today, Chuck
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.520]  Baldwin in the third hour.
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.700]  In fact, he's here in Austin now, flew in late last night. And he is going to be in
[01:04.700 --> 01:11.400]  studio with us today. And we're gonna talk about the Second Amendment, the culture wars,
[01:11.400 --> 01:14.240]  the Obama scandals, all of it with Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.480]  Then I'm gonna interview him for Obama Deception 2. We have a lot of really cool guests that
[01:19.480 --> 01:25.480]  we're gonna be having in studio as we fly them here for the production of Obama Deception
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.480]  2 that I wanna get out by September of this year. And amongst all the other work we're
[01:30.480 --> 01:39.640]  doing, Mike Judge. Mike Judge has been a listener for 17 years, he said.
[01:39.640 --> 01:43.120]  And I talked to him on the phone over the years and text messages back and forth. They
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.960]  have a lot of mutual friends like Rick Linkletter, but also Weldon Henson and others. And he
[01:48.960 --> 01:54.320]  gave us an in-depth interview and actually opened up about his politics and things, something
[01:54.320 --> 02:01.120]  he's never done before. And so this will be a news making interview.
[02:01.120 --> 02:09.280]  That's coming up in the next hour and it's almost a documentary. So Rob Doob and Darren
[02:09.280 --> 02:17.600]  McBreen, Marcos Morales, and some of the other crew did a really superlative job on this
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.120]  from an interview I did at his home last Tuesday. That is coming up, that'll be audio for radio
[02:22.120 --> 02:26.800]  listeners video, obviously, for prisonplanet.tv members, though we're now sending out a free
[02:26.800 --> 02:29.080]  video stream for everybody.
[02:29.080 --> 02:35.120]  If we can pay for the bandwidth, if it continues, I'm not sure how long I can do this. But infowars.com
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.560]  forward slash show has the free podcast, has the free audio, video stream of the daytime
[02:40.560 --> 02:46.880]  show. It has the free iPhone app, the free Droid app, and a bunch of other stuff and
[02:46.880 --> 02:50.840]  a link to the free newsletter to sign up to get the magazine free, a digital version.
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.920]  infowars.com forward slash show is also a link that's key to send out to your friends
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.280]  and your family. Again, I'm gonna try to cut some video ads to play over this to pay for
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.280]  it.
[03:02.280 --> 03:05.080]  It's costing me a lot of money and they're supposed to have that up a month ago and they're
[03:05.080 --> 03:09.880]  doing a great job. It's just that we're trying to do too much here. So please buy books,
[03:09.880 --> 03:20.920]  videos, t-shirts, get your high quality Propure water filters 15% off at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:20.920 --> 03:25.440]  You can sign up to be members, infowarsstore.com to get the Propure water filters 15% off.
[03:25.440 --> 03:29.140]  We're only running that for a week. All of that stuff is what allows us to then have
[03:29.140 --> 03:31.160]  our own platform to fight the globalist.
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.680]  We're not funded by NPR, by taxpayers, and by big tax-free foundations like Rockefeller
[03:36.680 --> 03:41.680]  Foundation. We are funded by the viewers like you, and that's why we're able to do this.
[03:41.680 --> 03:44.520]  I didn't mean to get into a plug right here at the start of the show. The point is, is
[03:44.520 --> 03:52.920]  that I start talking about that video feed, almost cringe, getting a $10,000 extra bill
[03:52.920 --> 03:54.920]  last month.
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.560]  And if it keeps growing, it'll be 20, 30,000 this month. And I just cannot do it unless
[03:59.560 --> 04:04.280]  we get the video ads up on it with sponsorship. So the point is, that's why we have prisonplanet.tv
[04:04.280 --> 04:10.120]  members who get all the films, get the nightly news, get all the extra stuff.
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.160]  Because this stuff cost us bandwidth, I don't know what it is, it's something ridiculous.
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.880]  I think just on bandwidth, I spend more than half a million dollars a year, just to give
[04:18.880 --> 04:25.240]  you an example. And I don't wanna spend my time worrying about money, because we're growing,
[04:25.240 --> 04:29.560]  but it's exponential, and the cost just goes up and up and up and up.
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.920]  So become a prisonplanet.tv member, and you can share it with up to 11 people, share username
[04:33.920 --> 04:38.840]  passcode, make sure it's a unique, original username passcode, prisonplanet.tv, become
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.160]  a member today. Okay, that's not what I'm covering today. Mike Judge is coming up, Pastor
[04:43.160 --> 04:51.180]  Chuck Baldwin in studio, wow, what a mix there. And then we're also going to get into Bernacki
[04:51.180 --> 04:56.360]  Sparks' massive stock market sell-offs, the meat cleaver attack in London, what's really
[04:56.360 --> 05:00.680]  behind that, so much more.
[05:00.680 --> 05:05.080]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights
[05:05.080 --> 05:10.200]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[05:10.200 --> 05:15.680]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.800]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[05:20.800 --> 05:27.920]  at infowarsteam.com, but I wanna point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds

[08:00.480 --> 08:07.440]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is
[08:07.440 --> 08:14.440]  the problem. From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become
[08:14.480 --> 08:21.480]  too complex to be managed by self-rule. That government by an elite group is superior to
[08:21.680 --> 08:28.680]  government for, by, and of the people. The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on
[08:28.680 --> 08:35.680]  for your mind.
[08:58.920 --> 09:05.920]  May 2013, Mike Judge in a big exclusive interview slash documentary, we spent a week putting
[09:08.800 --> 09:15.800]  together, will be premiered here in the second hour today. And then in studio, we have Pastor
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.160]  Chuck Baldwin talk about all the scandals and where he sees this country going and the
[09:20.160 --> 09:21.680]  Second Amendment.
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.040]  He's gonna be in studio with his former Constitution Party candidate and all around really great
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.320]  guy. I'm looking forward to having him here in studio. I don't think I've ever met him
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.000]  in person. No, I did meet him in person once in an event, that's right. So that's just
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.800]  some of what we've got coming up today.
[09:36.800 --> 09:43.800]  Obviously, they have hyped the daylights out of the machete-wielding terrorista there in
[09:47.200 --> 09:54.200]  London. Of course, it's a guy with a butcher knife and a meat cleaver. And I called Paul
[09:54.200 --> 10:00.920]  Watson, one of our London reporters, and I said, Paul, you call them meat cleavers over
[10:00.920 --> 10:01.920]  there?
[10:01.920 --> 10:07.920]  And he goes, yeah, they're called a meat cleaver or a butcher cleaver. And so I don't know
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.040]  why they're calling it a machete. In fact, it's a small meat cleaver. And he said, you
[10:12.040 --> 10:17.240]  and your children will be next Islamic fanatics wielding meat cleavers, butcher, and at least
[10:17.240 --> 10:21.840]  the Daily Mail got it right, and tried to behead a British soldier, taking their war
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.760]  on the West to a new level of horror.
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.280]  And Paul Watson wrote the story that's up on infowars.com saying, will Prime Minister
[10:31.280 --> 10:38.280]  David Cameron transfer weapons to the London terrorist working with these people? And that's
[10:40.760 --> 10:46.360]  a serious headline, because these very jihadis are being given heat-seeking missiles, anti-aircraft
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.360]  weapons, bazookas, heavy machine guns, and armored vehicles by NATO and by Israel, by
[10:52.360 --> 10:53.360]  the way.
[10:53.360 --> 10:56.560]  That's in the Israeli press. They're giving them vehicles and giving them field hospitals.
[10:56.560 --> 11:03.320]  And they actually fly al-Qaeda flags. And the main brigade, that's 4,000 troops, that
[11:03.320 --> 11:09.420]  is the most successful brigade, calls itself the Bin Laden Brigade. This isn't my show
[11:09.420 --> 11:14.840]  two years ago, saying, hey, these are really al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia brought in by
[11:14.840 --> 11:20.960]  NATO. This is now London Times, LA Times, New York Times, Council on Foreign Relations,
[11:20.960 --> 11:22.840]  London Telegraph.
[11:22.840 --> 11:26.980]  And you've got like a deputy Mossad chief was in the news a week ago going, it's better
[11:26.980 --> 11:33.980]  to leave Assad in than put al-Qaeda in, this is very bad. I mean, even the Israeli press
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.320]  is saying, why are we helping these people? So I wanna get this straight, cuz there's
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.420]  media articles out attacking me going, Alex Jones claims our government's funding al-Qaeda,
[11:44.420 --> 11:46.280]  he's a nut.
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, instead of getting an award or being told I was right and I had
[11:52.280 --> 11:58.760]  courage to tell the truth about this 15 years ago, even before 9-11, I'm even more ridiculed
[11:58.760 --> 12:02.760]  because I'm right. Well, I'm gonna get into this later too, cuz we've really, lizards
[12:02.760 --> 12:04.320]  have to understand this.
[12:04.320 --> 12:08.220]  Media Matters has almost no viewers or readers, but it's important because it's run by the
[12:08.220 --> 12:12.860]  White House on record, full of White House personnel. They watch the show, they listen
[12:12.860 --> 12:18.220]  every day, but they don't ever show video, you notice, they show audio edited on a blue
[12:18.220 --> 12:20.600]  screen to edit what we say.
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.640]  And then it's a talking point for Huffington Post, MSNBC, they all attacked us last night.
[12:25.640 --> 12:31.880]  And they added it to where I said that I basically thought black helicopters caused the hurricane,
[12:31.880 --> 12:38.880]  the tornado that hit the suburb of Oklahoma City more. And I was on three different radio
[12:38.880 --> 12:45.200]  shows this morning, one of them was our affiliate Knoxville, and I was on Man Cow and one other.
[12:45.200 --> 12:50.800]  Man Cow and the other show, two out of three, brought it up, and we're playing clips going,
[12:50.800 --> 12:52.800]  do you really think it was weather weapons?
[12:52.800 --> 12:57.280]  And I said, well, you notice that's not video, that's audio, they edited what I said. And
[12:57.280 --> 13:04.280]  they're doing this more and more, more and more. They're saying, Alex Jones says it was
[13:04.280 --> 13:11.280]  nothing but actors at Sandy Hook, I never said that, other people said that. They say,
[13:12.400 --> 13:14.880]  Alex Jones says have an armed march on Washington.
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.720]  I've said, I don't think it's a good idea, I've told people no over 100 times when I've
[13:19.720 --> 13:23.760]  been asked publicly on air. And I said that I thought it would be a setup and that they
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.640]  would arrest Kokesh ahead of time. But that I admired his courage, and I don't think he's
[13:28.640 --> 13:30.640]  a provocateur consciously.
[13:30.640 --> 13:37.600]  He said, well, I'm a provocateur for liberty, I think he's got a little too much chutzpah
[13:37.600 --> 13:44.600]  for his own good. Bravada, whatever you wanna call it, I get the civil rights of it, I get
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.400]  the civil disobedience that the laws blocking you from having a loaded rifle on your back
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.580]  in DC were overthrown in 2008, DC versus Heller.
[13:54.580 --> 14:00.580]  So he is spiritually in the right, there's the letter of the law, the spirit of the law,
[14:00.580 --> 14:06.800]  he is in the spirit of the law and in the letter. But you have a tyrannical government
[14:06.800 --> 14:10.460]  during a Fourth of July parade that's happening with a bunch of families out there, hundreds
[14:10.460 --> 14:13.280]  of thousands of people all over the place.
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.400]  It is tailor made for a provocateur, and I have said, I think it's a bad idea, but he's
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.440]  doing it. So I said, hopefully, alternative media will have so many cameras there, the
[14:22.440 --> 14:30.760]  feds don't try something. And still the media spins, what I just said there, I said that
[14:30.760 --> 14:34.960]  ten years ago when I was asked to have an arm march on DC to demonstrate the Second
[14:34.960 --> 14:35.960]  Amendment.
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.440]  I was asked that a month ago or three weeks ago when Kokesh announced this, I've asked
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.840]  this every day and that's the same answer. And when the media calls up, they call back
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.720]  at Heller and go, can I talk to you again? And then I get on the phone with the newspaper
[14:48.720 --> 14:53.680]  and they go, so you do support the march, you do think it's a good idea?
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.600]  And I said, I told you yesterday, it's not. So then the newspapers call me back the next
[14:58.600 --> 15:05.880]  day. It's like Bloomberg is doing some big cover story on me. And they keep over and
[15:05.880 --> 15:08.600]  over again, hauling up going, so this is what you said.
[15:08.600 --> 15:13.120]  I said, that's not what I said. And then they call back wanting to meet again so they can
[15:13.120 --> 15:21.800]  finally get me to agree to saying things I didn't say. So all I'm saying is we're under
[15:21.800 --> 15:28.160]  the White House magnifying glass. We need your prayers because they're running around
[15:28.160 --> 15:33.320]  saying that I said black helicopters did this when I didn't say that.
[15:33.320 --> 15:39.600]  And they're running around saying that I want an armed march and a shootout in DC. I didn't
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.920]  say that. Kokesh didn't say he wants a shootout. He did make provocative statements that I
[15:44.920 --> 15:49.480]  really think are wrong. And I told him off air and on air, but off air I said, they're
[15:49.480 --> 15:50.480]  coming to get you.
[15:50.480 --> 15:57.720]  He's like, yeah, I mean, I've seen people that have that type of bravado. And I can
[15:57.720 --> 16:02.240]  only admire it at a certain male level. I'm not gonna do that cowardly thing where I go,
[16:02.240 --> 16:09.520]  he's an idiot, he's stupid, he's crazy. I'm a man for saying he's bad. I mean, I get spiritually
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.160]  he's in the right and he's all geared up to do it, but I don't like where it's going.
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.080]  Now I'm gonna go to break here in a moment. We're gonna come back and they're trying to
[16:18.080 --> 16:23.520]  make what happened at Sandy Hook completely secret with the State Secrets Act in Connecticut.
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.360]  That's very dangerous. Bernanke sparks massive stock market sell offs from Japan to other
[16:28.360 --> 16:29.360]  parts of the world.
[16:29.360 --> 16:35.720]  We're gonna be getting to that. And I'm gonna get at the bottom of the hour to our top story.
[16:35.720 --> 16:40.680]  Riots are already basically starting in London. And we know the last riots were provocateur.
[16:40.680 --> 16:45.760]  There were real Muslim extremists and criminal groups out doing the rioting. The police stood
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.840]  down to allow it to take place. Now they've got the nationalist over there doing stuff.
[16:50.840 --> 16:56.520]  We're gonna get into all that. But here is just a tidbit of what's coming up in the next
[16:56.520 --> 17:01.260]  hour. Very powerful video and audio. The video is really good. The intro, Dermot Bring did.

[17:45.400 --> 17:49.960]  lower IQs. Enjoy your extra big ass fries.
[17:49.960 --> 17:55.840]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[17:55.840 --> 18:01.480]  Those found members of Congress on average speak at a 10th grade level. Most Americans
[18:01.480 --> 18:03.440]  read at an eighth or ninth grade level.
[18:03.440 --> 18:06.320]  Look now, talk slow so you can understand me.
[18:06.320 --> 18:11.360]  It was just a few thousand years ago that our ancestors were using primitive grunts
[18:11.360 --> 18:12.360]  to communicate.
[18:12.360 --> 18:13.360]  Internal investigation that shows the agency targeted the Tea Party, a conservative group.
[18:13.360 --> 18:25.160]  That does scare me. I think I'm just gonna make sure to not use the words Tea Party or
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.240]  the Constitution in any way work.
[18:27.240 --> 18:30.840]  All right. Who are you? CIA, FBI, ATF?
[18:30.840 --> 18:33.880]  While gun ownership is at an all time high, crime is down.
[18:33.880 --> 18:36.320]  No one will be able to be armed. We have to take all of them.
[18:36.320 --> 18:41.240]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[18:41.240 --> 18:45.760]  Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mao took the guns. And El Castro took the
[18:45.760 --> 18:50.840]  guns. You know, Chavez took the guns. And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence
[18:50.840 --> 18:54.560]  again if you try to take our firearms.
[18:54.560 --> 19:03.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[23:58.680 --> 24:21.200]  all right coming up the next segment so i have plenty of time to get into this we're
[24:21.200 --> 24:26.640]  going to air the full statement of the man running around with the meat cleaver him and
[24:26.640 --> 24:36.200]  his associate reportedly drove their car into someone wearing a pro-military shirt and then
[24:36.200 --> 24:43.400]  got out and unsuccessfully tried to chop his head off and you know to me here the bigger
[24:43.400 --> 24:50.280]  story is that everybody just stood around and walked over and talked to him and walked
[24:50.280 --> 24:53.080]  over like voyeurs and looked at the dead body i'm gonna tell you right now i'm not gonna
[24:53.080 --> 24:58.640]  act like i'm tough but i have i have been in fights with knives and things okay i mean
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.360]  i grew up insanely rough my parents didn't really know what was going on other than the
[25:02.360 --> 25:05.840]  fist fights i didn't ever pull knives on people but i've been in fights somebody trying to
[25:05.840 --> 25:10.640]  stab me and i've been slightly stabbed before i'll just leave it at that but the point is
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.520]  it didn't get into any organs i'll leave it to you that way and i got knife cuts on my
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.880]  hands knife cuts on my arm kind of looks cool you know when you're out the swimming pool
[25:18.880 --> 25:24.280]  but the point is is that if i saw two guys with meat cleavers and i wasn't armed i would
[25:24.280 --> 25:31.960]  run till i got a weapon or got to the police okay so these people didn't run though now
[25:31.960 --> 25:35.520]  my family was there i'm gonna fight you or if i'm cornered i'm gonna fight you but if
[25:35.520 --> 25:44.920]  i see big guys with meat cleavers and butcher knives boom baby i'm running i'm running it's
[25:44.920 --> 25:54.280]  that simple and something doesn't add up here see i'm already getting into this i said i'd
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.240]  get into it the reason i always say i'm going to get into it coming up is not to make you
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.180]  wait to listen it's that i'm like thinking of all these data points and it makes my head
[26:03.180 --> 26:09.720]  hurt how wrong this story is but then i don't know what the truth is it looks like it's
[26:09.720 --> 26:18.240]  real but then it also looks like something's fake or maybe i mean our i've been to england
[26:18.240 --> 26:27.600]  before our brits really this not just domesticated but to the point of guys are stabbing and
[26:27.600 --> 26:33.680]  trying to chop a guy's head off and then people stand there videotaping them and and then
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.280]  people are taking photos of the dead body like it's maybe people watch so much television
[26:38.280 --> 26:44.000]  that they didn't with with normalcy bias but it's a whole bunch of people i mean you would
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.920]  expect you got like a crowd of like 30 people at one time just in the view of the camera
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.420]  right up by the guys that have just run over somebody and then tried to chop their head
[26:54.420 --> 27:00.560]  off they should have had a serrated knife to do that by the way not a meat cleaver i
[27:00.560 --> 27:03.800]  mean it's a rated knife you can just saw right through it it's hard to saw a deer's head
[27:03.800 --> 27:10.000]  off with a hacksaw i mean you got to like really get into it hatchets work best if you're
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.640]  really in a hurry butchering a deer but the point is ladies and gentlemen is it it takes
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.200]  something to sever ahead and i mean even a chicken neck domesticated nanny state person
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.960]  see i'm already getting into it i'm gonna stop right there we're gonna come back play
[27:22.960 --> 27:28.120]  a statement go through all the points but i see these stories all the time where somebody
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.320]  gets run over in the middle of a town people watch them bleed to death or was a case in
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.620]  toronto where a woman's raped on a busy street on the sidewalk and then beaten in the head
[27:35.620 --> 27:40.300]  with a crowbar and then the business manager of a telecommunications company told us laughed
[27:40.300 --> 27:43.960]  at it they all watched it but then said don't call the cops we don't want to be called as
[27:43.960 --> 27:52.520]  witnesses a woman being beaten and she later died of aneurysms and the guy's saying you
[27:52.520 --> 27:57.280]  and your children will be next on the video we're gonna play that coming up islamic fanatics

[34:55.120 --> 35:02.160]  we have a rachel maddow clip where she says oh they they say sandy hook was staged and
[35:02.160 --> 35:07.200]  it was crisis actors and they say aurora was staged and they say this was staged and they
[35:07.200 --> 35:16.660]  say the tornado is staged no that's not what i said i said there were other men arrested
[35:16.660 --> 35:21.280]  in the bushes at sandy hook and then they got caught covering that up and then video
[35:21.280 --> 35:27.800]  got released of them arresting the person who it turned out was a auxiliary anti-terrorism
[35:27.800 --> 35:36.760]  police officer from a nearby county a federalized cop and we know that they have a history of
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.600]  protecting mentally ill people and letting them attack so my point was is they certainly
[35:41.600 --> 35:51.880]  were using it to blame all gun owners by the way guys when i get to this rachel maddow
[35:51.880 --> 35:57.040]  clip in a little while after i covered the attack in london will you do me a favor get
[35:57.040 --> 36:04.040]  me the senator white house clip from earlier this week where where he actually says you
[36:04.040 --> 36:11.080]  midwesterners won't do what it takes to fix climate change that means paying the un giant
[36:11.080 --> 36:17.520]  vats on all human activity for carbon selectively to shut down the west literally paying al
[36:17.520 --> 36:25.240]  gore's gore and blood company it's actually gore and blood i'm not that's not a pun the
[36:25.240 --> 36:29.520]  name of it is gore and blood it's one of the big carbon trading groups obama's invested
[36:29.520 --> 36:34.860]  in the chicago mercantile exchange on carbon trading the rothchild's own the biggest one
[36:34.860 --> 36:41.440]  in london i mean this is money you will literally pay a private tax to these global crime bosses
[36:41.440 --> 36:48.240]  to breathe and you know they're saying your carbon dioxide uxl is evil and they're saying
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.480]  cal flatulence they're putting taxes in in australia and canada and other places they
[36:52.480 --> 36:59.760]  want one here a cal flatulence tax i'm not joking just type in cal flatulence tax and
[36:59.760 --> 37:06.880]  you'll get articles all over the world yeah okay a total system of control over all industries
[37:06.880 --> 37:11.240]  selectively enforced to shut down their competition you know congress is voting to override the
[37:11.240 --> 37:17.360]  keystone pipeline blockage yeah there it is cbs news epa's air pollutant target flatulent
[37:17.360 --> 37:25.520]  cows boom cbs news and um the congress is going to override obama blocking the almost
[37:25.520 --> 37:32.960]  completed uh keystone pipeline and that's good but but but congress should also override
[37:32.960 --> 37:41.800]  the shutting down every week of up to five coal power plants in this country while china
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.180]  opens three a week that are totally dirty we have clean ones carbon dioxide water vapor
[37:46.180 --> 37:51.040]  coming out so they list carbon dioxide as a pollutant this isn't your grandma's coal
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.640]  facility i don't want to breathe that mercury filled stuff either but half our power or
[37:55.640 --> 37:59.720]  more comes from coal and they're shutting them down folks and the power prices are exploding
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.440]  america's power is being turned off i want congress and the tea party republicans who
[38:05.440 --> 38:10.600]  i i'm are light years better than the the globalist obamaites and they're doing a lot
[38:10.600 --> 38:14.420]  of good stuff and man when they do good stuff i'm going to tell you bainer is saying there
[38:14.420 --> 38:18.320]  needs to be criminal indictments and criminal investigations and there's no way obama didn't
[38:18.320 --> 38:24.560]  know about this because ran paul is saying arrest people uh cruz is saying i don't like
[38:24.560 --> 38:30.260]  the republican establishment we need to really get libertarian that's scaring them we have
[38:30.260 --> 38:35.840]  power to quote a tsa agent i have power i have power as they there's a famous case of
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.200]  them script searching someone and saying you're humiliating me and they beat the press i have
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.600]  power i have power no we the people that that work and run this country we have the real
[38:45.600 --> 38:53.280]  power and we're sick of this kleptocratic system so a lot of good things are happening
[38:53.280 --> 38:58.200]  and you can't just get mad at the out of control government and feel powerless and just buy
[38:58.200 --> 39:03.100]  more guns waiting for world war three you gotta buy more guns and get ready to defend
[39:03.100 --> 39:09.160]  yourself if we lose the info war because i mean they're not just going to bring in a
[39:09.160 --> 39:16.720]  soft tyranny it's going to be a really hard one and you know life's short i've done because
[39:16.720 --> 39:20.560]  at that point nobody can say i didn't work hard to try to stop it all you idiots that
[39:20.560 --> 39:27.640]  want to fight with american people i'll tell you what be like duck hunting season and let
[39:27.640 --> 39:31.360]  me expand on something they're now telling military don't wear their uniforms or insignia
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.240]  and in in london what do you think it's going to be like being a government person after
[39:36.240 --> 39:40.840]  you're taking people's families off to fema camps and stuff people are just look people
[39:40.840 --> 39:47.840]  aren't actually scared on average people are lazy and you take their prosperity away and
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.640]  then you shove them around they're gonna go haywire and i don't want that to happen i
[39:53.640 --> 39:58.160]  want stability i want freedom i don't want this you know the sewage to stop working in
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.400]  the water stop working i want the fluoride out of the water see there's good things that
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.280]  society's built and then evil hijacks it to control it and turns into something bad they're
[40:07.280 --> 40:13.160]  like you're against medicine and all vaccines no i'm not artificially acquired immunity
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.520]  is a real science it has a lot of side effects they're now finding connection to shutting
[40:17.520 --> 40:20.760]  down your regular immune system giving you cancer but you know there's something really
[40:20.760 --> 40:24.740]  deadly out there i want the vaccine for it but the globalists have done all this secret
[40:24.740 --> 40:29.660]  testing and stuff killing people and the vaccines are always poison and don't even protect you
[40:29.660 --> 40:35.000]  from what they're claiming they're protecting you from and so no i'm against it it's like
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.900]  i'm for the death penalty if we had a better government but if i was in nazi germany i
[40:38.900 --> 40:43.320]  don't think hitler should have the death penalty because the government's bad folks does it
[40:43.320 --> 40:50.720]  mean every part of the government's bad no but it means the people running it are portland
[40:50.720 --> 40:56.100]  oregon just defeated water fluoridation they're trying to fluoridate there they'll just try
[40:56.100 --> 41:00.940]  to pass a state law now the fed's will making you drink it anyway side issue let me get
[41:00.940 --> 41:06.240]  into the terror attack we got the mike judge interview coming up and some of you'll be
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.360]  like oh this is a good interview it's entertaining but what's so hardcore about him being pro
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.880]  second amendment what's so hardcore about him criticizing obama well i mean that's a
[41:13.880 --> 41:18.440]  big deal with mike judge who's a list hollywood and the guys i don't want to tell you what
[41:18.440 --> 41:25.080]  people in syndicated tv make but he's a writer producer and the actor uh got a big hbo show
[41:25.080 --> 41:31.160]  coming out he is very influential and a really smart guy and to have him really waking up
[41:31.160 --> 41:37.240]  because he talked about that some on air with us in the interview that's coming up but you
[41:37.240 --> 41:40.760]  know and he said a lot more after even though we talked on the phone and stuff over the
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.840]  years he wanted to meet and personally hung out for about five hours you know i'm gonna
[41:44.840 --> 41:49.520]  say this going into the interview next hour i'll just tell the story next hour the point
[41:49.520 --> 41:59.160]  is is that it's great that you know so many people in the media are actually waking up
[41:59.160 --> 42:05.360]  this is how we're culturally you're only supposed to be a mainline republican or you're supposed
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.160]  to be a hardcore communist basically and that's all you're supposed to be what about being
[42:09.160 --> 42:15.400]  a freedom lover what about unifying around private property family right to self-defense
[42:15.400 --> 42:21.920]  uh honoring women honoring fathers honoring good children honoring art honoring literature
[42:21.920 --> 42:28.280]  honoring decency honoring fealty truthfulness because that's the only thing that's good
[42:28.280 --> 42:36.040]  in this world evil isn't sexy folks i know a lot of people think it is and uh you know
[42:36.040 --> 42:39.500]  i know a lot of big hollywood people people bigger than mike judge people bigger than
[42:39.500 --> 42:49.920]  charlie sheen people bigger than mel gibson and you know i've bumped into and gotten to
[42:49.920 --> 42:53.760]  know mel gibson and his family a long time ago but don't know him very well the point
[42:53.760 --> 42:58.280]  is i know people even bigger than that and they are scared to go public they're listening
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.640]  to this show right now probably and so i just admire people that have courage i'm gonna
[43:03.640 --> 43:07.560]  say that next hour because i think i'm gonna run a rebroadcast sunday we need an intro
[43:07.560 --> 43:14.240]  to the mike judge thing so i'll talk about that next hour let's look at the horrific
[43:14.240 --> 43:23.560]  events that we were shown on television uh yesterday in england first off uh we've asked
[43:23.560 --> 43:30.660]  the question david cameron to arm woolrich terrorist london attacks boost clash of civilizations
[43:30.660 --> 43:36.240]  narrative given his government's policy in arming johannes extremists in libya and syria
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.400]  british prime minister david cameron and his foreign secretary william hague should immediately
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.960]  order the transfer of heavy weaponry to aid the two terrorists who beheaded a soldier
[43:44.960 --> 43:50.160]  in woolrich after running over him with a car or ramming him cameron yesterday condemned
[43:50.160 --> 43:53.980]  the slaughter of the soldier by two jihadists remarking we have had these sorts of attacks
[43:53.980 --> 44:00.340]  before in our country and we've never buckled to the face of them as if giving this all
[44:00.340 --> 44:04.960]  that attention should rise to a national level a guy with a meat cleaver that happens to
[44:04.960 --> 44:09.960]  british citizens they have it out of control knife crime there uh sword crime there because
[44:09.960 --> 44:13.840]  they've taken the guns something like nine times our crime rate you can look it up i
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.560]  covered it a few months ago on air so imagine he's like we'll stand in the face of this
[44:18.560 --> 44:22.640]  so they'll use their own muslim extremist culture they've helped foster and brought
[44:22.640 --> 44:26.760]  in and protected and everybody else is politically correct but the muslims can do whatever they
[44:26.760 --> 44:33.800]  want that's all done on purpose to let the more radical muslims that are actually globalist
[44:33.800 --> 44:37.800]  finance take control these guys look like useful idiots they were born in england they
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.440]  were converts they're not the hardcore jihadis out of qatar and saudi arabia being brought
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.120]  into syria and libya to engage in mass headaches i mean there are videos of black families
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.800]  children because they you know some of the racist arab muslims don't want blacks in africa
[44:51.800 --> 44:56.240]  imagine where can the blacks be hacking them up with machetes because the bullets you know
[44:56.240 --> 45:00.760]  are too much and it's so much fun to hack somebody up that'll never be on your news
[45:00.760 --> 45:05.960]  or kids with their arms and legs blown off by bombs and drones but they'll show you this
[45:05.960 --> 45:13.480]  to invoke fear right as they roll out checkpoints all over england searching everybody's bags
[45:13.480 --> 45:18.520]  this is the nanny state so paul watson came out and pointed that out and that the globalist
[45:18.520 --> 45:25.760]  actually run al-qaeda now you look at these guys uh now uh anti-muslim reprisals after
[45:25.760 --> 45:32.080]  woolrich attacked english defense league that's basically
[45:32.080 --> 45:37.000]  quasi skinhead group and the streets battles with police and woolrich and mosque attacked
[45:37.000 --> 45:45.480]  and apparent acts of revenge and so um
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.200]  this is how they do the divide and conquer this is how they play people off against each
[45:49.200 --> 45:56.800]  other and then it turns out the mi six operative a swat was the head of the bombers on seven
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.000]  seven and all of that was known there was a total stand down and a drill of the exact
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.640]  same buses and train of exact same trains and bus being attacked at the exact same time
[46:05.640 --> 46:11.520]  that's on bbc and again they use that so the regular metro police would think it was part
[46:11.520 --> 46:19.680]  of a drill you understand that this that is a fact i cover it in my film terror storm
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.680]  a history of government sponsored terrorism it just gives you i don't know like 20 examples
[46:24.680 --> 46:30.040]  or more of modern states staging terror attacks it's actually more than that we show the government
[46:30.040 --> 46:32.960]  saying we're going to blow up building seven and blowing it up and then saying they never
[46:32.960 --> 46:39.200]  said that i mean it's it's incredible film the point is is that then the cops show up
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.560]  and this guy reportedly had a revolver that blew up in his hand you bet money these guys
[46:44.560 --> 46:49.160]  are real nuts and were put up to it in fact it turns out mi5 knew who they were and was
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.180]  tracking them it's always the same story either purely staged or they allow it to happen or
[46:53.180 --> 46:58.640]  they give them everything and then the revolver blew up in his hand reportedly something like
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.700]  a 38 special folks that is incredibly rare for a gun to blow up in your hand especially
[47:03.700 --> 47:09.680]  that revolver or the safest guns out there that's classic setup okay ram the car into
[47:09.680 --> 47:14.640]  them their imam tells them is really mi6 or mi5 it's it follows the pattern and now it's
[47:14.640 --> 47:20.160]  coming out ram them into the person saw their head off have some of your own operatives
[47:20.160 --> 47:26.820]  there to shoot footage you've got the crowd just standing around just just totally with
[47:26.820 --> 47:32.980]  normalcy bias thinking it's no big deal then you put out videos and paul watson debunks
[47:32.980 --> 47:41.860]  this showing orange hands they've gone in and color manipulated the video and it shows
[47:41.860 --> 47:48.000]  the street signs that are really red because paul lives in london are now orange and then
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.880]  they say there's no blood on his shirt there's clearly blood on his shirt blood on his sleeves
[47:51.880 --> 47:57.800]  he's just wearing a navy navy shirt so the blood blends in you know blood blood is really
[47:57.800 --> 48:04.560]  kind of a dark purple well when it's unoxygenated it's actually deep blue the blue bloods but
[48:04.560 --> 48:11.260]  the point here is that this is now going to be used as a political diversion as david
[48:11.260 --> 48:16.120]  cameron stands up to the muslim extremist as as as riots and and disturbances are now
[48:16.120 --> 48:23.200]  already breaking out in parts of london right now and people are putting out videos saying
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.720]  there's no blood on his hands altering them and then they'll have rachel maddow say alex
[48:27.720 --> 48:35.320]  jones says there was no blood and that he was a crisis actor there are real crisis actors
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.980]  for drills they do have actors sometimes added events to prime the pump and to get an official
[48:40.980 --> 48:45.120]  story out that happened on 9 11 i saw it happen people putting out an official story minutes
[48:45.120 --> 48:55.500]  after purely scripted but no sandy hook was real aurora was real and this is real and
[48:55.500 --> 49:00.760]  they got two nuts there's all these witnesses wound up to go give a political speech run
[49:00.760 --> 49:08.840]  somebody over and here's the key they said they were planning to cause riots all over
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.780]  england and overthrow the government which is exactly what the government's geared up
[49:12.780 --> 49:19.200]  for and wants just like the government would love to use an armed march that's peaceful
[49:19.200 --> 49:25.120]  on dc as civil disobedience to then start something and demonize all gun owners that's
[49:25.120 --> 49:28.280]  why i don't like the idea of the march but if they're going ahead with it cameras need
[49:28.280 --> 49:34.760]  to be there to document what's going on and happening so the globalists aren't able to
[49:34.760 --> 49:41.000]  set something up but then i can't morally say you should go there because it's a very
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.540]  dangerous situation but no guts no glory no guts no liberty fortune favors the bold the
[49:45.540 --> 49:50.360]  fortune we want is freedom and regardless i could come out and fully denounce this march
[49:50.360 --> 49:54.640]  they're going to say i organized it and and that basically i did it just like they're
[49:54.640 --> 49:59.800]  now saying all over national news so-called news white house run news white house going
[49:59.800 --> 50:02.860]  i mean i mean media matters writes it that's the white house so they can have plausible
[50:02.860 --> 50:08.580]  deniability oh we don't know who the irs did this we don't know why house people transition
[50:08.580 --> 50:15.320]  had all of them run that they go out edit my audio to say that i'm saying that the tornado
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.680]  was man-made when the caller asked me and i said no they can make tornadoes here's the
[50:19.680 --> 50:23.920]  washington post here's the london guardian they can also create and steer hurricanes
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.720]  i had been limingston the head of weather weapons on so yes it exists but uh you know
[50:28.720 --> 50:34.520]  usually they don't control her tornadoes very hard uh and they don't care they'll just edit
[50:34.520 --> 50:39.560]  that here here the easter bunny did the tornado how's that sound no you guys are actually
[50:39.560 --> 50:46.460]  a conspiracy theorist you've got senator winehouse saying midwesterners farts did it okay now
[50:46.460 --> 50:51.200]  that's the wild conspiracy theory that flatulence from cows and midwesterners not paying you
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.560]  carbon taxes that it's their fault it happened and he doesn't want to appropriate money from
[50:55.560 --> 51:01.680]  his state to take care of oklahoma that's what really happened you pig digestive health

[52:07.680 --> 52:13.060]  a good food storage we thought the danger was drought or food delivered to our gas tanks
[52:13.060 --> 52:18.120]  or our food sold to other countries or food so expensive that only those on food stamps
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.800]  and welfare could afford it but we have just experienced the most effective way to lose
[52:22.800 --> 52:28.680]  your freedom liberty and security without even a fight government regulation after a
[52:28.680 --> 52:35.160]  160 year tradition of self-reliance the do-it-yourself and charitable mormon food storage canneries

[53:14.640 --> 53:19.800]  as a recent widow living alone it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake tv near
[53:19.800 --> 53:24.280]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[53:24.280 --> 53:30.740]  tv when i'm actually away from home fake tv easily plugs into any outlet just like a light

[54:11.440 --> 54:25.040]  all right the big mic judge interview is coming up that we're going to have in studio covering
[54:25.040 --> 54:30.240]  a bunch of news with us former constitution party presidential candidate and good friend
[54:30.240 --> 54:35.480]  of mine who's here uh in town chuck baldwin talk about all the scandals we're going to
[54:35.480 --> 54:40.620]  get also after the judge interview i'm going to need to get into the media attacking me
[54:40.620 --> 54:47.960]  and a rachel maddow club trying to say that we said the tornado was made by obama the
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.500]  government has weather weapons we know they're geoengineering our atmosphere my point is
[54:52.500 --> 54:56.680]  it could have been but probably wasn't well they cut that out of there to make it look
[54:56.680 --> 55:02.280]  like i said that and again the reason we cover it is to discredit the white house and to
[55:02.280 --> 55:07.840]  tell you they wouldn't be making all this stuff up and attacking us if we weren't effective
[55:07.840 --> 55:15.080]  i mean they spend most of their time on info wars.com and drudgereport.com making stuff
[55:15.080 --> 55:20.660]  up or misrepresenting what we say and why is that drudge will tell you they're shipping
[55:20.660 --> 55:25.280]  general motors to china i will too we'll tell you when they get caught saying they're going
[55:25.280 --> 55:29.360]  to take our guns you know there's video of them saying yeah we're going to ban the guns
[55:29.360 --> 55:32.640]  we'll show that and the white house has said that's why they don't like drudge because
[55:32.640 --> 55:37.720]  he'll show what they're really up to and again i raised these points to you know point out
[55:37.720 --> 55:42.080]  that we have power that that that you have power that we can beat these people they're
[55:42.080 --> 55:47.480]  not invincible they're not god even though they walk around on red carpets now if you
[55:47.480 --> 55:53.100]  go to info wars.com we have an article why the woolrich attack says was the woolrich
[55:53.100 --> 55:57.680]  attack a hoax debunked and it shows how people have edited the videos and said there's no
[55:57.680 --> 56:05.880]  blood on his hands it's a video breaking it down by paul watson and then people say what's
[56:05.880 --> 56:11.480]  up with old ladies strolling by and people watching this is how people are now he didn't
[56:11.480 --> 56:17.840]  act menacing towards them it's a poor neighborhood and you know it's it's racist folks it was
[56:17.840 --> 56:22.880]  a white guy that got killed so it's okay and that's what multiculturalism is all about
[56:22.880 --> 56:27.600]  and then whites back and forth become racist and think everybody's out to get them and
[56:27.600 --> 56:32.680]  then the government can then play the referee but here is the statement of the of the meat
[56:32.680 --> 56:38.720]  cleaver wielding gentleman who hope reportedly we've got his twitter to cause riots and a
[56:38.720 --> 56:45.160]  race war kind of helter skelter charlie mansion style and there is some rioting and fighting
[56:45.160 --> 56:50.520]  and attacks on mosque going on and the police of course will get to be the referee of that
[56:50.520 --> 56:54.940]  which is why they're creating this clash of civilizations funding the radical muslims
[56:54.940 --> 57:00.960]  here's some of what he had to say the only reason we have killed this man today is because
[57:00.960 --> 57:05.760]  Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers and this British soldier is one is an eye
[57:05.760 --> 57:09.920]  for an eye and a tooth for a tooth by allah we swear by the almighty allah we will never
[57:09.920 --> 57:14.440]  stop fighting you until you leave us alone so what if we want to live by the sharia in
[57:14.440 --> 57:19.720]  muslim lands why does that mean you must follow us and chase us and call us and kill us rather
[57:19.720 --> 57:24.480]  you are extreme you are the ones when you drop a bomb do you think it picks one person
[57:24.480 --> 57:30.600]  or rather your bomb wipes out a whole family this is the reality by alive i saw your mother
[57:30.600 --> 57:35.160]  today with a buggy i would help her up the stairs this is my nature but we are forced
[57:35.160 --> 57:41.920]  by the quran in surah atoah through many many ayah throughout the quran that we must fight
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.840]  them as they fight us an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth we apologize that women
[57:46.840 --> 57:51.320]  had to witness this today but in our land our women have to see the same you people
[57:51.320 --> 57:55.240]  will never be safe remove your governments they don't care about you you think david
[57:55.240 --> 57:59.000]  cameron is going to get caught in the street when we start busting our guns you think your
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.800]  politicians are going to die no it's going to be the average guy like you and your children
[58:03.800 --> 58:08.400]  so what they're doing tell them to bring our troops back so we're going to play more of
[58:08.400 --> 58:11.720]  this this is actually the raw feed you're not really seeing this on the news they're
[58:11.720 --> 58:17.320]  editing what he has to say but we're going to come back with the next hour in fact i'll
[58:17.320 --> 58:23.120]  finish up the next little segment of the mike judge interview is coming up but again this
[58:23.120 --> 58:27.880]  is a real guy i can tell by his demeanor he really thinks he's doing a good thing i i
[58:27.880 --> 58:31.680]  think it's terrible what he did but at least he picked out a soldier the globalists like
[58:31.680 --> 58:36.080]  to target civilians and then say terrorists did it but this was done and i believe he
[58:36.080 --> 58:51.360]  was provocateur into doing this this is gcn the genesis communications radio network now
[58:51.360 --> 58:56.040]  that we have moved into the winter season there is an increased need to support our

[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:37.280]  okay just to be clear radical islam saying kill anybody that basically isn't converted
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.880]  to your faith is is bad and it's being funded by western governments publicly because they
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.960]  use it to keep those countries over there down in the dark ages they also then try to
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.800]  flood western countries not with even other westerners they make it impossible but with
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.400]  people that come from the more radical regions of the world to create a clash of civilizations
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:07.760]  i've watched the video i believe the guy with the meat cleaver is for real is proud of himself
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:13.520]  and we've got his twitter account here we're going to be going over this more coming up
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:24.400]  in the next hour when we are joined in studio by chuck baldwin but anti-muslim reprisals
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:31.740]  after woolrich attack a mother talked down woolrich terrorists who told her we want to
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:37.740]  start a war in london tonight and then we've got the tweets he reportedly was sending out
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.840]  this guy believes as i can't find those tweets will you reprint those for me i know you gave
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:49.160]  them to me but they're just not here thanks so this is the type of stuff oh i found his
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.720]  tweets right here thank you this is the type of stuff that's going on and it really just
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:02:00.800]  shows you what cattle the public are because they not only didn't fight the guy i mean
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.920]  because obviously i had a gun or i had like a club or something and i saw somebody you
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.400]  know obviously attacking someone with a meat cleaver people would call me crazy i would
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:15.640]  probably probably engage them if i didn't have a weapon i would run as fast as i could
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.760]  that's why you have fight or flight instincts you have to gauge the situation uh but he
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.940]  literally he and his reported uh compatriot of the witnesses were saying ran over the
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.720]  guy and then tried to chop his head off with a non-serrated edge so that didn't go too
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.360]  bad the first guy goes for the female fed and the machete and she's not even ramping
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.920]  she looks man out like robo cop never seen nothing like that and the cops came in he
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.400]  probably had a revolver and it blew up his face probably the one his imam gave him it
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:55.760]  will turn out as an mi-6 agent i mean they just found a guy that isn't too smart who
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.960]  though has courage and they wound him up and he went out and killed a soldier at least
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:08.520]  he didn't blow up a daycare center or something like the feds did at oklahoma city still is
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:17.160]  bad what he did but this is asymmetrical warfare from his perspective but the guy it's now
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.760]  coming out that mi-5 knew who they were it's i mean they bare minimum let him do this and
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  i would guess gave him the gun and everything else uh so uh that's the basics of what's
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.280]  going on with that let's go out to break with more of the clip of him here he is the only
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:40.840]  reason we have killed this man today is because muslims are dying daily by british soldiers
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.280]  and this british soldier is one is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth by a law
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.880]  we swear by the uniting a law we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.960]  so what if we want to live by the sharia in muslim lands why does that mean you must follow
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.000]  us and chase us and call us and kill us rather you are extreme you are the ones when you
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.640]  drop a bomb do you think it picks one person or rather your bomb wipes out a whole family
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.600]  this is the reality by alive i saw your mother today with a buggy i would help her up the
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.640]  stairs this is my nature but we are forced by the quran in surah atoah through many many
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.000]  ayat threw up the foot that we must fight them as they fight us an eye for an eye and
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.160]  a tooth for a tooth we apologize that women had to witness this today but in our lands
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.360]  our women have to see the same you people will never be safe remove your governments
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.160]  they don't care about you you think david cameron is going to get caught in the street
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.400]  when we start busting our guns do you think your politicians are going to die no it's
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.880]  going to be the average guy like you and your children so get rid of them all right we're
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:48.240]  going to break that nobody's armed i mean if that guy was doing that in texas he'd be
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:54.800]  shot down in seconds and somebody would run him over with a car in fact that's what i
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.360]  do i mean it's just amazing by the way they arrest you for that dingling if you defend

[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:10.360]  danger we're in alex jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage we thought
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.200]  the danger was drought or food delivered to our gas tanks or our food sold to other countries
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:21.120]  or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it but we
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.960]  have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom liberty and security
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:32.920]  without even a fight government regulation after a 160 year tradition of self-reliance
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:37.400]  the do-it-yourself and charitable mormon food storage canneries in half the country are

[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.040]  if you try to take our firearms doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the

[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:34.880]  encouraging patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones it is civil
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:44.000]  it is our basic rights it is our god-given rights to not turn in our firearms if they
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.360]  pass unconstitutional gun laws and if they take our guns that is the final straw of the
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.440]  american people becoming becoming slaves we're gonna be getting into some of the new pushes
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.040]  to get our guns coming up later pastor chuck baldwin former presidential candidate the

[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:22.680]  msnbc lying with edited clips uh saying that uh i said that the tornado that hit uh last
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.160]  week or earlier in the week was a government weather weapon a caller asked me are there
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.580]  weather weapons and i said well yeah they're on record and i talked about ap articles and
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:36.960]  others and then i simply said this could be but probably not that's tornado alley people
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.960]  need tornado shelters not fema and then they don't care they edited it to where i answer
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.160]  the caller's question because i had a guest on about weather modification we were already
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.120]  talking about weather modification the day before and that day because it's in the news
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.280]  so just amazing deception and it's not about us but it it's about illustrating how they
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:04.640]  deceive we'll get into bernacchi sparks massive sell-off continuing with the devaluation of

[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.680]  it's global warming attacking the people that are dead and the media doesn't even pick that
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:56.520]  up and then mix it up that i say obama did it with a with a with a weather machine amazing
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.880]  amazing what these people do they are desperate ladies and gentlemen if the white house run

[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:26.180]  his home and shoot the video for info wars nightly news that radio listeners are about

[01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:01.680]  of a libertarian he gets into the second amendment his views on socialist but a lot of it is

[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:15.420]  one to start with breakfast tacos i don't have an answer i'd wanted to go into comedy
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.800]  for a long time like sketch comedy and stuff because i always did imitations and things
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.280]  like that and but anytime i'd try to pair up with someone because you need other people
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.120]  to do that you can't do that by yourself and i had a friend in high school just like brilliant
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:34.360]  like funny guy and i'd go okay just do that imitation of james sanchez that you do and
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.880]  we'll do he's like oh but no one knows who he is and i said it doesn't matter it's funny
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.780]  you know and so yeah i was trying to do stuff that would just like make my friends laugh
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.720]  making like my brother laugh my friend that kind of stuff is how i was thinking of it
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.680]  and i always had a hunch that that would work and then you think you influenced south park
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.720]  i think so i mean tray and matt have said that and uh they're they've been really nice
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.960]  about that i mean i'm i'm uh yeah i mean i think i think that's just genius all the stuff
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:09.040]  they do you know stupid toilet safety administration shoes off belts off sharp objects go in the
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:17.320]  plastic tray this is inhumane shut up sir i wanted to do animation since i was a little
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.820]  kid i mean uh i didn't think of it as a career so much as just something because that wasn't
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:29.640]  ever described as i mean my mom especially it was all about you know science that's worth
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:36.400]  that which i was and i was kind of good at math and science so but animation was my burning
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.120]  desire i actually kind of hit a fork in the road when i was i don't remember how old i
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:48.040]  was i'd saved up money from a summer job and i i had a paper out and i was gonna either
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:54.660]  buy it like a 16 millimeter camera that single framed or i was gonna buy then i decided okay
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:17:00.440]  i could buy a base an electric base and then i started looking at the price of film and
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:06.040]  was like you know what that's just not possible and the base was gonna give me a social life
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:15.160]  if i could be in a band or something so then i didn't start doing animation until i was
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:23.280]  like 26 really so and when i just got the idea to do animation um which i'd wanted to
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.640]  do but i never thought of doing as that as a way to get into comedy then i thought well
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.800]  this is great i i don't need to i can do this all myself i don't need to you know convince
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.400]  a bunch of people to get in front of a camera and do this and that i can just do the whole
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:42.680]  thing on my own so i work for a living and i mean real work not writing down gobbledygook
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:48.960]  i have a hard time saying i'm either a democrat or a republican it just doesn't feel good
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.880]  i was definitely raised my parents were very liberal um then i don't know certain things
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.020]  started to you know i mean a lot for a lot of people that's kind of almost a religion
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:06.400]  to them and right wing stuff is too you know so uh i try to not be part of any of that
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:16.560]  um i suppose i've become a uh interested in you know smaller government kind of thinking
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:24.040]  uh it that sort of happens when you know i think you you know when you build your own
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:29.920]  thing when you do do your own thing and then suddenly you're getting penalized left and
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:36.120]  right you know that that kind of can change you if you've got a business that you didn't
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:43.320]  build that somebody else made that happen i don't ever want to be one of those people
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:51.100]  that uses my whatever fame or whatever level of that notoriety i have from from what i
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:55.760]  do in comedy to try to go into politics i just i'm just like i don't feel like i'm
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:02.520]  qualified it kind of bugs me when people in hollywood will use that you know their you
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.020]  know their audience that they've gained through that to try to put out a political message
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:14.360]  and they have no idea what they're talking about king of the hill hank was definitely
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:20.220]  you know i saw sort of a i don't know like populist kind of like you know a guy who's
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:27.780]  like just trying to do his thing and just all these government and all these other weird
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:33.560]  things of the modern world or that was always the fun of it is um just all these things
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:40.260]  just kind of poking at him you know i live in the real world where men sell propane and
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:48.120]  propane accessories i i definitely uh i remember i remember popping into vhs when alex jones
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.880]  was on uh cable access it was you and two other guys and somewhere i i i can't find
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:59.800]  it anymore but i think i labeled the tape three dale's you were kind of the the more
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:05.200]  rational one and the other two guys were just like uh i don't know i wish i could find that
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:10.400]  tape but um king of the hill started with a drawing of the four guys that i've done
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.200]  i was kind of like dabbling and doing panel cartoons which i never really did at all i
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:19.640]  started i went straight into animation i didn't draw comic books or anything and so so i had
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.800]  the four guys and dale i just something about the way he looked originally i had his hat
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.120]  say smith and wesson the first drawing i ever did it i just put that on there i don't know
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.560]  why just the way he looked and and uh i'd done a first draft of the pilot and then greg
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:41.240]  daniels got involved and at some point you know we had this thing where his wife is uh
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:48.080]  you know getting it on with this native american healer and clearly his kid's not his but so
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:54.040]  we had this idea about that he's just you know it's almost probably a subconscious thing
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:00.520]  he's like he's into every conspiracy except the one that's going on in his own house nice
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:06.040]  work john redcorn she didn't suspect a thing it's almost like his escape you know or something
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:11.300]  i mean if i i never psychoanalyzed it that much but i kind of feel like that's what uh
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:15.720]  that character was about so he was almost like looking for conspiracies you know kind
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:21.440]  of uh and some of them might have something to him some of them are crazy i have read
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:28.600]  a book now who do you believe me or hank i know hank more believable dale was is kind
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:35.320]  of one of the ones that you know probably gives you guys a bad name uh johnny hardwick
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:41.840]  who does the voice i don't you may even know him he he um he had a few like he had a few
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.640]  kooky theories of his own and sometimes we would work those i mean there's one line he
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.960]  said that he's talking about something and it ended with him saying something that they're
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:57.960]  doing and corn is next a french study that was just released finds rats that are fed
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.320]  genetically engineered corn suffered from tumors and severe organ damage this is the
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.620]  first study that's looking at the effects on rats of eating genetically modified foods
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:13.400]  over their lifetimes they gave the rats the genetically modified corn they gave them the
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:20.320]  genetically modified corn with the herbicide that the corn is used with on dale it was
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.840]  i had to do some convincing to get them to let johnny hardwick do the voice i mean he
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.420]  was he wasn't anybody famous at all he was one of the people we hired as a writer but
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:33.880]  it just sounded right to me ended up being my favorite character really on the show as
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:39.800]  far as well just for a while you know as far as the voice and the drawing clicking and
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.800]  but i mean they had all kinds of celebrities they were pitching it hardly ever works when
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.760]  you just get like oh let's get this famous person and this person to draw it and then
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.520]  you have something that just doesn't make sense which is a lot of why a lot of shows
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:23:02.440]  fail squirrel tactic okay i grew up in albuquerque new mexico which definitely influenced a lot
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:09.140]  of what i do because beavis and butthead to me is kind of set in a sort of like eastern
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:15.040]  new mexico west texas type environment you know where everything is just sort of people
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:22.660]  are bored teenagers are bored and there's like it's nothing to do it's hot it's kind
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:29.440]  of a recipe for disaster and so that was definitely an influence on beavis and butthead although
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:35.400]  you know i don't think i've ever told this story but so my grandfather on my mom's side
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:45.720]  lived with us and he died when i was i think in junior high and like 76 whatever and he
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:52.960]  we found out he had a a 16 millimeter bolex camera that was there and i was like wow okay
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.520]  there's a camera in this house and so i waited i waited like a good two or three months before
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:06.440]  i you know after he passed away to say hey could i borrow granddad's camera maybe and
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:13.180]  she said no and then like i waited another six months and no waited like a year no so
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:17.460]  i that's when i was i thought well okay maybe i'm just gonna buy one and then i looked into
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:24.280]  how much they cost and just couldn't couldn't pull it together years later when i was uh
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.600]  like i said like 26 and i started got the idea again to try to do an animation i ended
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.640]  up buying the same exact camera because it turns out that's the perfect camera to single
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:40.560]  frame and shoot animation on and um finished my first animated short first couple ended
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.520]  up getting them on like comedy central and stuff sent a tape to my mom and uh she said
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:51.720]  i said oh that's interesting you know you probably don't remember your grandfather had
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:59.000]  a bolex camera i'll see if i can find it i was like no i remember i was like drooling
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.320]  over the idea of just being able to get my hands on it you know for but it all worked
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.960]  out but uh yeah it was kind of in a way it was probably good because it kind of by the
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.200]  time i was able to actually do it i was just it had been a fantasy it sounds weird but
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:19.440]  it was like a fantasy of mine for so long to to do animation and so when i finally did
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.000]  i mean i really you know i didn't take it for granted when i had the opportunity to
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.720]  do it so probably was a good thing actually y'all got that in there large fries high large
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:41.600]  coffee like beavis and butthead um i'll get asked a lot if that's based on anybody specific
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.860]  and it's not there's no it's not like that was that person that was that person um it's
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:50.760]  just started out as drawings and then but but definitely like there's little bits and
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:57.160]  pieces from all kinds of people in there you know a lot of us were yeah i mean it's a little
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:03.080]  bit of his like me and my brother but now i mean we weren't you know we got good grades
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.920]  and we were but some of these people are really intelligent too there's a guy who's now he's
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:12.120]  now a professor i won't say his name but he he's one of these guys like i would see him
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.600]  in the hallway i think this is the laugh i don't even know the laugh came from i just
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.000]  written down huh huh huh on kind of on the i started out as a storyboard it was the first
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.600]  time i'd animated something where i was usually i would start with the voice and then do the
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.580]  drawing this one i started with a drawing and i didn't know what they would sound like
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:38.280]  and um i just drawn huh huh huh on there um years later i realized there's a mimi pond
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.800]  cartoon that um and i've become friends with her on facebook now but she uh where she had
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.600]  a guy going a weirdo on a bus doing that and i think that might have been in the back of
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:53.200]  my head but i i started doing that laugh and i was kind of like going like this is reminding
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.960]  me of something didn't think about it till probably two years into the show that it was
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:02.800]  there was a guy at my high school who had just he was uh really smart stoned all the
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.520]  time but he would just you'd see him in the hallway and i would always see him when the
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.880]  hallway was empty and he'd just start like one of these guys that he started going hey
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.000]  mike he just always had this laugh it was different than butthead laugh but it was that
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  thing of just kind of how's it going and so when i was when i would do the voice i would
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.200]  just kind of do the and i would and i would get i would be doing it sort of to get into
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.680]  character to get the voice sounding right and then i'd go well that kind of sounds funny
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.440]  that he's just laughing all the time anyway and then i and then i realized later it was
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.800]  probably in the back of my head because of this guy who used to just kind of talk like
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:52.360]  that but it's there's a lot of that little bits and pieces of people there's beavis the
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:58.000]  beavis laugh there was a guy who was uh was actually in calculus class and he was a really
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.640]  smart guy he's a now nuclear engineer i hope he doesn't figure out who he is that i'm talking
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.120]  about him but he uh he kind of was always like we had a hot teacher which was unheard
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.880]  of back then she was a former dallas cowboys cheerleader uh anyway he would get really
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:21.280]  excited and he just like he was biting his lip all the time and just kind of going like
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.120]  like laughing at everything she said so i started i started out beavis uh doing the
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:32.560]  spastic laugh like that and then around like yeah around like season two i started getting
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.440]  like where i don't even know if i can do it i'd get into the higher register the i'm getting
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:44.120]  to this like kind of higher register of like where he's like kind of going i can't i have
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.720]  to warm up to it but i started out with that laugh and then i just kind of made his voice
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:53.720]  sound like the laugh just like raspy you know the animated shows that have really taken
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:29:00.780]  off or when somebody it's usually it's usually the person is animating it doing the voice
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:06.460]  which is other than the simpsons but i mean the simpsons the voices and the characters
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:10.240]  just match they're really well done but like you know you look at like family guy or south
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.960]  park or ren and stimpy it's like you know somewhere in those guys heads it's like the
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.540]  it just it makes sense that voice those voices sound like they come out of those characters
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:26.300]  and i think i think that clicks on beavis and butthead too especially now i'd say beavis
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.240]  and butthead probably that's probably the thing we're gonna go to break and when we
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.880]  come back we will air the conclusion of the mike judge exclusive interview and he gets
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.300]  a lot more political and it'll certainly be news making and a lot of people that are mike
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.800]  judge fans will now be influenced to be pro second amendment and to believe that people
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:48.880]  actually built that mike judge actually drew his cartoons his drawings and voices he did
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:30:01.800]  it we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:25.440]  a Friday the twenty third day of May 2013 I'm your host Alex Jones Chuck Baldwin's coming
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:30.700]  up later in the next hour in studio with us today we're going to get into all the different
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.920]  scandals you name it I'll probably give the phone number out take some calls and we're
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.000]  going to be interviewing him for the Obama deception that pastor Chuck Baldwin is here
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.840]  with us but right now let's go back to the premiere of Mike Judge which again never gets
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:49.680]  political and he gets a little political here that's a lot for Mike Judge he's obviously
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:57.560]  said a lot more off air he's really awake but not on air but he still said quite a bit
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:05.640]  and that is coming up right now here it is there was Beavis the Beavis left there was
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:12.680]  a guy who was actually in calculus class and he was a really smart guy he's now a nuclear
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:19.080]  engineer I hope he doesn't figure out who he is that I'm talking about him but he he
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:24.400]  kind of was always like we had a hot teacher which was unheard of back then she was a former
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.840]  Dallas Cowboys cheerleader anyway he would get really excited and he just like he was
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:34.360]  biting his lip all the time and just kind of going like like laughing at everything
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:41.400]  she said so I started I started out Beavis doing the spastic laugh like that and then
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.960]  around like yeah around like season two I started getting like where I don't even know
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.760]  if I can do it now I'd get into the higher register I'd get into this like kind of higher
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:58.600]  register of like where he's like kind of going I can't I have to warm up to it but I started
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.600]  out with that laugh and then I just kind of made his voice sound like the laugh just like
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:10.200]  raspy you know the animated shows that have really taken off are when somebody it's usually
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.520]  it's usually the person who's animating it doing the voice which is other than the Simpsons
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.080]  but I mean the Simpsons the voices and the characters just match they're really well
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.640]  done but like you know you look at like Family Guy or South Park or Ren and Stimpy it's like
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.960]  you know somewhere in those guys heads it's like the it just it makes sense that voice
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.960]  those voices sound like they come out of those characters and I think I think that clicks
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.860]  on Beavis and Butthead too especially now I'd say Beavis and Butthead probably that's
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:46.560]  probably the thing I'm most proud of I think probably the best thing I've done there were
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:54.520]  moments of making Office Space where I thought this is like the what I was born to do but
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:01.160]  then I think it's probably Beavis and Butthead I mean King of the Hill probably overall is
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:06.840]  overall the best thing I've done but Beavis and Butthead like some of it there's about
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:11.320]  a third of it that's not that great because we were cranking them out so fast at the beginning
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:17.920]  of that show I mean it was just like MTV just going as many of them as you can make it's
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.120]  on every day there's no quality control they didn't know how to produce a show nobody did
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:27.800]  it was a train wreck but so I ended up the episodes I liked I ended up spending all my
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.840]  time on and those ones I think are great that's probably the best stuff I've done but and
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:39.760]  the new Beavis and Butthead I think are as good as good or better than a lot of the old
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:49.240]  ones but King of the Hill overall is probably like a good good more less spotty like just
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:37:05.240]  you know good quality consistent now it's extinct you know I grew up very liberal parents
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:12.160]  like thinking gun control is the way to go you know it's that Michael Moore movie those
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:20.040]  bowling for Columbine kind of actually made me go the other made me think like I mean
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.880]  he's not trying to that's not the effect he wanted I don't think but he's like kind of
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.880]  that movie kind of makes you think no gun control is a bad idea I mean to me if you
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.920]  look at it like I don't think that's what he's trying to do at all but like he mentions
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:38.400]  Canada in there and he says you know there's lower crime there and same people own guns
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:45.460]  and I don't know I own guns it's I think if you look at it statistically you actually
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:52.440]  are safer I got me a couple AKs some shot offs 25 9 millimeters and a couple of ground
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:58.200]  to airs I got a Ford up in the hills virtually impenetrable and enough supplies to outlast
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:05.300]  a 30-year standoff I know this because okay so 1993 Beavis and Butthead the series came
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:12.580]  out and gun crimes have gone down since since Beavis and Butthead came out but what's interesting
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:18.040]  is that nobody talks about no no one wants statistics I like I actually went to I actually
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:22.300]  took graduate probability and statistics classes that was what I was gonna become a math teacher
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:29.040]  before all this Beavis stuff happened but when I was getting blamed for all this like
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:34.960]  downfall of youth that whole time crime was going down in almost every category from the
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.760]  time I mean if you really wanted to make a correlation you could say Beavis and Butthead
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.600]  is saving the world but that's stupid that that really doesn't make any sense but it
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:49.200]  makes more sense than saying this particular thing happened in this particular thing happened
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:58.280]  you know but but really like statistically there's no correlation all right who are you
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:06.360]  CIA FBI ATF yeah there's that map where it's just like almost county by county where gun
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.140]  control it's it's not doing any good it's like there's higher crime rates where there's
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.200]  gun control lower where there isn't I mean it's just like county by county I mean you
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:22.720]  can't I think cuz I have this science background I just look at that you know you know that's
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.020]  it's kind of ridiculous as much as you know those bumper stickers might have been run
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:32.740]  into the ground I mean it's it's true it's like I would be all for it if it was effective
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:37.120]  but it's I haven't seen anything that shows it's effective you know well now said political
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.680]  power goes out of the barrel of a gun what does Hank Hill say about about disarming people
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:51.200]  it is the right of all Americans as cotton has taught me to own a gun even though I'm
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:40:01.320]  not so good at shooting them a Japanese machine gun blew my shins off in ww-2 I loved it it's
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:06.600]  good to see somebody yelling at piers Morgan you excuse me of attacking the Second Amendment
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.440]  of the Constitution I want to get people off pills that the insert says that you commit
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:15.200]  suicide and kill people Alex let's get about the second I want to blame the real culprit
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.560]  Alex suicide pills Alex mass murder pills okay let me ask you one question it was interesting
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:26.560]  though the the the way it seemed to be spun and all these websites there's all these websites
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:33.880]  now that have a bunch of hipsters on him who will just kind of like kind of play a clip
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.800]  and grin and chuckle about it and that's how I saw it I can't remember what it was on I
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:45.160]  was thinking hey right on Alex on everything you were saying was true too I mean the clip
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:50.360]  that I saw because you yeah you're talking about yeah Hitler took the guns Stalin took
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:57.800]  the guns male took the guns for Dale and if you try to take our guns 1776 will commence
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.100]  again if you try to take our firearms doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.320]  on the street begging for them to have their guns taken we will not relinquish them do
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:12.000]  you understand something like that okay you know I used to do you really well I can't
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.320]  like it was the I was the water filter commercial used to do or what it what the it's been it's
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.640]  been a while you think I'd have it down now though I was just like hanging out with you
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:34.480]  last night look at these headlines IRS targeted tea party groups for scrutiny searching words
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:40.200]  like patriot tea party that does scare me I think I'm just gonna make sure to not use
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:51.040]  the words tea party or Constitution in any of my work I won't yeah well it's they're
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.680]  calling it the constitutional restrictions or whatever they referred to it has yeah that
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:04.520]  was that actually is scary that yeah that that's gonna make me listen to some more Alex
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:11.760]  Jones come on come on store do it
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:37.720]  well if I was to get heavy and deep on it I think the one thing that's made me tick
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:46.000]  or makes me I mean other than just wanting to try to be funny it tends to be and I didn't
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.400]  I don't overanalyze but then you know when you do this long enough you do analyze what
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:56.680]  I think what it is is probably I think a lot of us are just kind of out of sync with the
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:02.480]  way the world is right now you know like the way the modern world we're not we're not prepared
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.960]  for it all the time and there's a lot of stuff that's messed up about it and I think that's
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:12.080]  where a lot of my comedy comes from it's like things that you know anything from being stuck
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.880]  in a cubicle to being stuck in classrooms that you don't belong in those kind of things
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.160]  I think that I get a lot of material out of that I gotta get out of here I think I'm gonna
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:29.040]  lose it oh sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays when I started doing animation
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.480]  it wasn't I wasn't trying to get rich I wasn't trying to get I mean it did not seem like
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:41.420]  I could get rich off that I thought I really just it's just like a desire to just express
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:44.720]  something that's hard to describe and if I could describe it I would probably be more
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.360]  of just a flat-out writer or something like that and so a lot of this stuff is like you
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:54.540]  know it's always very hard to describe Beavis and Butthead to people who just ask if they
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:44:09.000]  haven't seen it I never set out to say I'm gonna be a satirist but that's definitely
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.460]  what I mean I I've always the very first thing I animated was the cartoon called office space
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:21.940]  it was before Dilbert and it was like melting at his cubicle and the boss and it was um
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:29.000]  it was I wanted to do just a series of office characters because you know when I when I
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.880]  grew up it was a little like I'm 50 so like an office job was considered a good job like
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:37.880]  you it's like oh good you don't have to work construction okay you and then when I first
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.560]  got in an office I had a temp job before I was an engineer and I was just like going
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:47.080]  god this is torture I mean there's a woman answering the phone the same way next to me
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:45:02.260]  all day long I'm alphabetizing in my sleep it's like and then kind of and then that kind
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.560]  of sick feeling of like oh all these years of thinking this is a good job and this is
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:13.000]  what it is oh my god what am I what's gonna happen to me you know next Friday is Hawaiian
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:21.480]  shirt day so you know if you want to go ahead and uh especially back then when I started
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:28.440]  out a lot of what Hollywood was putting out just was really not in touch with the way
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:35.660]  most Americans feel it was very like coming from I mean most people in Hollywood honestly
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:43.280]  that I'm still are like from pretty wealthy families usually and don't don't seem to have
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.320]  ever had to really you know come up from the bottom and struggle I think it's still that
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:50.960]  way is that but so I think a lot of it was like like when I started doing this stuff
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.840]  you know about cubicle life was like just to kind of say hey has anyone else felt like
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:04.100]  this when they're stuck in a cubicle you know and has anyone else noticed that that sometimes
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:09.260]  teenagers look really deranged and stupid you know it's that kind of thing of like wanting
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:13.760]  to kind of point something out that maybe no one else has pointed out that that's a
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.940]  lot of it I think when I did that first office space cartoon which is just a two-minute homemade
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:23.720]  crappy little short I mailed out VHS tapes of that just called information and I got
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:29.140]  so many calls and I think a lot of people saw it as something very fresh and different
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:34.600]  you know I used to have my own stapler too and then when I moved back they made me give
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:41.920]  back my stapler and but bill told me I'm supposed to have a stapler so and until I'm told different
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:48.880]  I'm just gonna take a stapler if they make me give it back I'll just I'll set the building
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:58.000]  on fire oh hello Milton what's happening I'm gonna need you to go ahead and move your desk
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.460]  again so well if you could go ahead and just get it as far back into that corner as possible
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:11.420]  that'd be terrific so Idiocracy I had the idea for it actually when I was writing the
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.100]  Beavis and Butthead movie was just kind of the seed of the idea when I was thinking about
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:19.420]  just the way evolution works and thinking like well wait there's no predators now so
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:27.620]  it started it started with that but then I was actually in line with my daughter's because
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:35.780]  I was in 2001 at Disneyland at the teacups ride and I was in the summer and my daughters
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:41.340]  were little at the time and along comes a woman like there's a woman behind me who had
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.460]  an altercation with this other woman and they both have their kids in strollers and they
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:53.200]  just start going off kick your ass and I'm like kids and like thinking this isn't what
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:59.340]  Disney had in mind you know and and this was in 2001 so it was the summer right before
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:05.740]  September 11th so I was also thinking you know what if what if the movie 2001 instead
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:10.160]  of being this you know the monolith and everything being pristine and advanced what if it was
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.860]  like the Jerry Springer show and giant Walmart's what if that had been that movie 2001 so I
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:20.720]  kind of was thinking like just take that chart from when that was made to now and project
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:28.220]  it out and just like see where that would go and the years past mankind became stupider
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:38.460]  at a frightening rate so Fox I still owed them part of my overall deal was to write
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:43.260]  two movies for him so I'd done Office Space and in order to do something else for anybody
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:49.080]  else I needed to burn that one off and I sort of I kind of thought no one would make it
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.320]  but I thought it'd just be fun to write I just start from there you know this was like
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.940]  it was making me laugh I just after the Disneyland experience I just started writing stuff down
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:03.900]  and ended up co-writing getting someone to work with me this guy Aton Cohen and we got
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:11.020]  through a first draft pretty quickly and gave it to Fox and then no one kind of wanted to
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:15.620]  make it and I was like okay well it wasn't gonna be huge budget but it was gonna be something
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:21.980]  that was gonna cost you know twenty three million or something and it just sat there
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:27.920]  and I'm trying to remember how and then Luke Wilson wanted to do it and I was like okay
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.700]  then I started to see it again then I went back and rewrote it kind of with him in mind
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:40.380]  and just just rewrote it because it needed to be better anyway and we had in the script
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:45.340]  this whole thing about the Starbucks and because I remember actually driving on I-35 it was
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:52.100]  like something tan it was a tanning salon it said exotic tan for men and I had no idea
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:59.420]  that tanning salons had turned into you know whatever it was and so I was just talking
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:02.900]  to friends of mine and going wow I wonder what's next I mean is it gonna be like Starbucks
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:10.580]  or what and so we had that in the script and when it was in pre-production I was you know
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:13.900]  they run it by legal I'm going man I don't know how I'm gonna come up with something
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:20.500]  better than the Starbucks thing because it it was it's not funny if it's not a known
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:25.540]  place you know and so legal an interesting thing happened I mean I don't know I don't
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:31.620]  know how this happened but but they said well they said no and then they said well you know
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:37.080]  I just said so what can it be satire and they said well what would help us is if you didn't
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.700]  just pick on them if it was a bunch of companies I was like okay so then that's how we ended
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:45.600]  up with that whole red light district in there in the movie where it's like I think it's
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:52.340]  like H&R block adult tax return with release and all right folks we're gonna come back

[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:39.060]  the New World Order here's the conclusion of the mic judge interview talking about idiocracy
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:43.980]  and so I was just talking to friends of mine going well I wonder what's next I mean is
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:51.340]  it going to be like Starbucks or what and so we had that in the script and when it was
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:55.140]  in pre-production those you know they run it by legal I'm going I don't know how I'm
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:59.540]  going to come up with something better than the Starbucks thing because it what it's not
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:06.220]  funny if it's not a known place you know and so legal an interesting thing happened I mean
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:13.060]  I don't know I don't know how this happened but but they said well they said no and then
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:17.500]  they said well you know I just said so what can it be satire and this and they said well
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:21.580]  what would help us is if you didn't just pick on them if it was a bunch of companies it's
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:26.880]  like okay so that's how we ended up with that whole red light district in there in the movie
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:33.540]  where it's like I think it's like H&R block adult tax return with release and like there's
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:40.900]  like there's like a Pollo Loco or Pollo Baracho adult chicken I don't know what we and then
[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:46.340]  and then we just did everything Costco I don't know what happened at some point I'm sure
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:52.340]  somebody got really flipped out but I was shielded from all that a similar thing happened
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:57.940]  on Office Space but Idiocracy I've been getting so much love for it like in the last two years
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:05.100]  what you're saying is that you want us to put water on the crops yes water like out
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:09.900]  the toilet well I mean it doesn't have to be out of the toilet but yeah that's the idea
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:16.120]  yeah I think a lot of the stuff that's in there maybe is starting to happen you know
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:21.220]  now instead of five hundred years from now when it's set and that's the Secretary of
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:28.940]  Education it's kind of stupid when he's president Camacho's stepbrother still does a pretty
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:33.260]  good job it's supposed to take place during a drought it was the rainiest summer ever
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:39.300]  in Austin we were just having to kill grass everywhere in the background but they didn't
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:43.340]  really give it a release there was a contractual obligation they had to put it in like 12 theaters
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:47.780]  and that's all they did I think in fact if you called movie phone they didn't even it
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:53.660]  was listed under untitled Mike Judge project they didn't even bother it went straight from
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:59.500]  what it was on the contract to movie phone they didn't even put Idiocracy in there Dwayne
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:07.060]  Elizondo Camacho five-time ultimate Smackdown champion porn superstar and president of the
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:12.360]  United States had called a special summit with the smartest man in the world so you
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:24.340]  smart huh no no I thought you here would be bigger go look like a peanut let's get just
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:31.020]  warning well I do know what they told me which and I finished the movie long at least like
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:35.180]  I want to say like nine months before it came out I was it was in the can I'd finished the
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:42.860]  mix I'd turn the whole thing in what they told me was it didn't test very well which
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:47.740]  a lot of movies don't you know office space didn't whoa I think I just figured something
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:59.300]  out be this what this sucks yeah it really sucks me this sucks more than anything that
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:06.820]  I've ever fucked before the way movie testing works they have these sheets and it says excellent
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:13.740]  very good good fair and poor for it to count at all it has to be excellent or very good
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:19.300]  I think so if they say good that's just a zero for you so a lot of people if it's a
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:23.500]  weird movie they'll go it was good they won't say very you know so all right folks we haven't
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:28.020]  gotten to the real second amendment zinger very good that's right at the end so at the

[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:55.180]  visit gcnlive.com today a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:58.700]  even though I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving and my research
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:03.620]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:08.420]  united states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:14.060]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves

[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:40.340]  Well I tell you I love it when we get somebody like this around I feel like I know him so
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:44.460]  good as I've interviewed him probably 20-30 times over the years and I played so many
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:51.900]  clubs on the air and I also like to watch his church services from Montana used to be
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:56.500]  in Florida he gave a really good one that I saw a couple weeks ago talking about the
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:00.780]  connection from the past to now which really resonated with me he went through the Bible
[02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:07.420]  verses everything our ancestors did against tyranny is for not if we don't continue it
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:11.860]  it's like electricity and you think about your grandmother her grandmother grandfather
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:16.260]  going back they all love that person took care of them and then the next person was
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:20.700]  born and it's like electricity there's a genetic line but also a training everything spiritual
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:28.060]  right back to people 50 generations ago a hundred generations ago and it's just amazing
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:32.540]  but I'm already going off into his sermon on that perhaps tonight on the nightly news
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:37.200]  we can get into some of the bigger issues here that but he's got a new book out he's
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.820]  put two books out with his son his constitutional lawyer Timothy Baldwin pastor Chuck Baldwin
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:45.300]  is here there's a little short five-minute segment some stations don't care it's will
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:50.140]  really come back in a moment but the new one is to keep or not to keep why Christians should
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:54.580]  not give up their guns a biblical perspective and even if you're not a Christian 77% of
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:58.640]  this country says they're a Christian and they Billy Graham and his son you know turn
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:06.300]  your guns in oh please you know IRS harass us they are government minions more and more
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.340]  and you know Chuck knows all these people he's been in those big national councils with
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:13.620]  them in the rest of it we're going to talk about how we take the churches back in America
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:17.220]  today I want to get into that I want to get into the scandals what else do you want to
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:22.140]  get in today Chuck Alex first of all just it's great to be with you it's good to have
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:26.420]  you here my friends good to see the studio good to see your staff good to see what you're
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:32.300]  doing here from Austin to see me stomping around see you behind the camera it's terrific
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:36.420]  to be here thank you very much and and all these issues you're talking about are the
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:41.060]  issues that all of us are addressing in our own venues and you know we've been in Montana
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:47.100]  now for about three years and loving it just you know love what God is doing for us there
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:51.300]  in the Flathead Valley of Montana got a brand new church up there called Liberty Fellowship
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:56.540]  Alex it's a non 501 C 3 Church and that's exciting to me because we don't have to work
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:02.260]  about any of that and we've got hundreds of people that are coming and attending and excited
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:07.780]  and our our Liberty Fellowship video messages are online thousands of people are watching
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:11.940]  we got hundreds and hundreds of people that are watching us live every Sunday afternoon
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:17.060]  as we live stream the broadcast across America a lot of people have are fed up they can't
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:22.740]  find a church that they can attend there's no Patriot pastor in the pulpit so they watch
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:28.420]  us every Sunday afternoon at 2 30 Mountain Time and their home or the living room they
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:33.440]  have community centers have a VFW post whatever it may be they gather around the TV and you're
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:40.260]  teaching the old real Christianity not not the new thing and you were telling me on the
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:43.740]  phone that you have all people that aren't even Christians coming now yeah because that's
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:47.260]  what originally attracted people was the message of Liberty where there is the Spirit of the
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:51.820]  Lord there is Liberty right and a lot of people that come and then they don't know the Lord
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:55.440]  after coming for a little while and they hear the message of truth and the message of Liberty
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:00.220]  from the scripture that's not being preached usually they wind up accepting the Lord and
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:03.620]  becoming a Christian so that you know that's really exciting but you're not beating people
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:06.800]  over the head with it no we just it's all these Pharisee preachers that turn everybody
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:12.140]  away just preach the truth and and you know all truth comes from Christ he is the way
[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:16.620]  the truth in the life all truth comes from Christ and that means all truth ultimately
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:21.360]  leads to Christ so when you preach the truth and that includes the truth of Liberty and
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.700]  freedom and constitutional government and the principles that God has inculcated in
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:30.220]  his word relative to freedom when you preach that it's going to ultimately lead back to
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:35.060]  Christ I mean you can't help but absolutely Chuck Baldwin's our guest we're gonna get
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:40.980]  into the IRS scandals Ben Ghazi get his take on the brutal beheading by a Muslim extremist
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:46.540]  after they ran a British trooper over and people are saying that's a false flag I don't
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:52.740]  think it is this is some morons but the West has been radicalizing Islam for the clash
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:56.960]  of civilizations and they can take our liberties we're gonna break that down as well stay with

[02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:49.100]  horrible and of course you know the only thing worse is a returning veteran or a libertarian
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:53.060]  or constitutionalist or in colorado they're openly you know the state police have admitted

[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:28.900]  books these really could change the face of this country which is starting to happen romans
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:33.300]  13 the true meaning of submission this was hitler's favorite verse to say you know render
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:36.620]  unto caesar the things that are caesars do what the government says when it's actually
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:40.780]  the opposite of what the bible says it's full of it's got to be 50 or something bible verses
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:46.640]  in here a great book history but the new one is to keep or not to keep why christians should
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.140]  not give up their guns by timothy baldwin who is a constitutional lawyer his and of
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:57.000]  course his dad a pastor uh charles o chuck baldwin and you know he's on with us right

[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:05.820]  news tonight the real reasons he's here is to be interviewed for obama deception 2 and
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:08.460]  of course he was kind enough to come here i guess it didn't get relayed when i said
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:12.380]  set him up for obama deception 2 that that was why he was here but now now he knows that's
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:16.720]  why he's here uh so much going on you know a lot of stuff goes into making the sausage
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.500]  around here folks you don't want to see it happen but before we get into all of this
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:25.720]  and both these books are available at info war store.com and purchasing there also supports

[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:47.980]  uh and i'm afraid they'll come shoot me in the head and say i resisted or something i
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:54.080]  mean this is what you know authoritarian systems tend to do we've got uh really a clash happening
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:59.220]  an awakening is happening how big you know it is questionable that it appears to be giant
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:03.140]  from what i've seen but while the evil is also on the offense i wanted to ask chuck
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:11.600]  baldwin pastor chuck baldwin his take on the state of the world in general and this tectonic

[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:48.240]  see the office but then we'd have fans outside the door so it's kind of a private facility
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.400]  it's just that we are trying to go to the next level and and so i appreciate your good
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.820]  report like you said uh in your uh in your sermon you gave you know he has given a good
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:12:02.360]  report okay where would you like to begin here today i've thrown out a lot of stuff
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.940]  i tell you what i'd like to begin with the book uh because i really believe that this
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:13.220]  book to keep or not to keep why christians should not give up their guns could revolutionize
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:17.900]  the churches of america and literally could change the course of the country you know
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:23.060]  when we went through this last debacle with feinstein and obama trying to uh cram this
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:28.020]  gun control legislation down our throats it would have happened except for millions of
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:33.420]  people freedom-loving god-fearing people rose up and said no you're you're not taking my
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:37.780]  semi-automatic rifles we are not going to tolerate any more gun control and they rose
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:43.780]  up with such a voice that it didn't even pass the u.s senate democrat controlled u.s senate
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:50.260]  so we won a temporary victory but the the thing that we noticed alex was that the pastors
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:56.020]  of the churches were absolutely silent they were not even engaged whatsoever they took
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:13:00.740]  no stand in fact some of them just said well we should do whatever the government says
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:05.220]  and so we recognize that as we my son tim and i that there wasn't anything out there
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:10.840]  in book form addressing this subject and so we set out to do that and we we really put
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:16.200]  our hearts and our minds in this we put together we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.660]  of bible verses you know there's been a lot of books written on the second amendment from
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:24.500]  a constitutional point of view or historical point of view alex there's not a book out
[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:30.060]  there anywhere that no i know the book came in a couple weeks ago i could not put it down
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:34.780]  and the issue is even if you're not a christian out there or religious folks they have captured
[02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:39.360]  through the world council of churches and ecumenicalism and all of it the churches major
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.460]  methodist churches are taking the crosses out from san francisco to austin texas they're
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:49.460]  sending in change agents who are really globalist operatives the southern baptist convention
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:53.620]  is saying okay there's no second amendment major catholic publications are coming out
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:58.580]  saying time to repeal that's the headline second amendment explain how the country was
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:04.300]  founded pastor is also a historian and versus what they've done now i mean the globalists
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:09.620]  knew they had to get the churches and folks you need to know that if you're in one of
[02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:13.660]  these 501c3s worshiping the government you might as well move to north korea and worship
[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:20.340]  kim jong-un yeah the history of our country is is really the history of the church there
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:24.260]  would have been no bunker hill there would have been no lexington green there would have
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:28.460]  been no conquered bridge no declaration of independence there would have been no united
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:34.300]  states of america had it not been for the pastors of colonial america that the british
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:39.120]  crown called the black regiment they were they called them that because the long black
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:43.220]  robes they wore in the pulpit but these were men like jonas clark pastor of the church
[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:48.740]  of lexington for example that taught their congregants what the biblical principles were
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:52.800]  relative to freedom and liberty the second amendment the preservation of life the protection
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:59.260]  of life etcetera so when the british troops ascended upon lexington talk to those folks
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:04.780]  out there talk to the preachers there they are i'm pointing at the camera tell them when
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:13.960]  they when they ascended on lexington in april 19 1775 it was it was the minutemen of that
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:20.580]  of that time that they called in history now were really nothing more than the congregation
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:26.420]  of the church of lexington pastored by jonas clark these men have been taught the principles
[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:32.060]  of liberty of freedom of self-defense etcetera they knew where the line was drawn they knew
[02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:37.220]  that we only have one sovereign and that's not government it's god it's the lord jesus
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:45.180]  christ and that any authority human authority that tramples the rights of others that abridges
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:51.060]  the parameters and jurisdiction that god is granted to it in scripture they become tyrannical
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:55.480]  and they must be resisted because there's only one king and that's and that's not king
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:00.380]  george or it's not the president it's the lord jesus christ so the congregants at the
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:05.100]  church of lexington understood this and when the british troops came 800 of them there
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:10.980]  was about 70 75 men from the church of lexington that stood on lexington green right outside
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:16.660]  the church where they worshipped every sunday with their muskets in hand and they formed
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:22.380]  a line of defense the british saw them open fire eight men were immediately killed they
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:26.500]  returned fire in self-defense and that was the shot fired heard around the world and
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:31.700]  the war for independence began they went to concord they amassed the defense at the bridge
[02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:36.260]  they drove off the british and and everything became history at that point the point is
[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:41.540]  that never would have happened had it not been for the pastors of colonial america and
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:46.040]  that's the difference that tim and i saw alex whenever we were looking at this latest gun
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:51.860]  grab attempt by obama i've been to 20 churches in town or more i don't care baptist whatever
[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:55.980]  it is it's a bunch of government worship and and what did you think when when when billy
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:00.140]  graham's organization and his son came out against the second amendment i mean this is
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:04.900]  unbelievable well yeah well you know what i thought because i you read my column but
[02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:09.220]  yeah franklin graham you know and and land richard land course you need to understand
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:13.740]  that richard land from the southern baptist convention uh is a member of the cfr probably
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:17.900]  most of your audience uh very enlightened audience that's a group sworn to destroy the
[02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:21.780]  united states he's a member of that so that didn't surprise me but i really was disappointed
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:27.100]  when franklin graham came out and endorsed portions of of the obama gun grab i think
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:31.940]  it shows a couple things i think it shows how thirsty these these guys are to receive
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:36.500]  the approbation of government i think secondly that's like the kiss of death who whenever
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:41.140]  the media attacks me i go more more yeah i know they don't get it they're out of bullets
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:44.940]  i i realize that but let me tell you what i came out of the religious right alex i was
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:49.380]  with the moral majority back in the 80s jerry fallwell was my mentor i traveled with him
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:53.620]  on his personal jet i've been to all the big conferences as you said i i've met these guys
[02:17:53.620 --> 02:18:00.020]  i've talked with these guys i know what's going on there is a desire among so many of
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:06.140]  them to be accepted by the power elite no it's like status and people get off on it
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:10.140]  like it fulfills them like they're not fulfilled till they're hanging around with some billionaire
[02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:13.980]  well there's a lot of perks that go along with it too this is not you know when you
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:19.540]  sit at the king's table there are perks and they want those perks but but regardless of
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:22.420]  that i think there's another with franklin i think it was also maybe a little bit of
[02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:27.520]  ignorance i i don't know some of these guys i think are disconnected from reality first
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.580]  of all most of them have never studied the constitution i'm telling you most of them
[02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:37.060]  have never studied the constitution they've never read our history they have a very myopic
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:42.700]  view of christianity they've been taught uh in a paradigm that's that's very limited in
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:47.860]  scope and i think that a lot of that lack of education and information it comes out
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:50.940]  whenever they start supporting some of these things and they really don't know what they're
[02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:55.620]  supporting so whether it's one or the other the matter of the fact is that i took franklin
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:03.280]  to task on this publicly several times that we cannot allow these christian leaders who
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:09.020]  do not know the constitution to form the opinion of the churches and christians in america
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:12.140]  and that's why we wrote this book it's the bible that does it that's exactly right if
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:16.820]  you want to start a new religion called government worship go do it write your new book and and
[02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:21.020]  try to get your converts but don't say the bible says we're supposed to worship government
[02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:25.220]  i mean according to this romans 13 interpretation germans should have submitted to hitler and
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:29.620]  i guess they did yeah and 20 million of them died exactly and and according to the to the
[02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:34.860]  modern interpretation uh of the subject at hand is christians have no right to to defend
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:38.500]  their second amendment rights they should turn over their weapons should the government
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:42.940]  require them to do so and stand around while somebody saws the guy's head off the the the
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:47.020]  video in england of these guys killing this guy with yeah and everybody just stands around
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:50.900]  even talks to him and everybody's so liberal they're kind of like yeah maybe murdering
[02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:55.980]  him is good i mean he was white and uh so i mean the answer is set up a wood chipper

[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:31.360]  chuck boblin's our guest this is a short segment long segment coming up chuck i was
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:37.860]  talking to you during the break and you're the same way you want to work all the time
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:45.160]  fighting this because being oppressed having tyranny come in and taking over your life
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:52.600]  is so fundamentally upsetting and then you see other people just happy to sell out to
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:25:00.260]  it and i think that's a spirit that's in people but continuing getting into the book meant
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:05.680]  to be given to preachers that goes over the hundreds of bible verses about being armed
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:10.740]  what does the bible say about self-defense versus what these government-run churches
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:15.720]  say yeah and and not just the pastors but also the christians that are in the pews they
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:21.640]  need to be enlightened every bit as much yeah the the very first chapter of the bible when
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:28.160]  you get into the work of creation god gave man two basic commands he told him first of
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:33.800]  all to be fruitful multiply replenish the earth that's the command appropriation all
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:38.720]  right and then then right after that he said if any man shed man's blood by man shall his
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:43.920]  blood be shed so right away you have the duty and responsibility to provide life and then
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:52.240]  secondly to protect life the protection of life is just as important as the as the ability
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:59.040]  to provide life so god gave to both both of those responsibilities to man it is it is
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:04.960]  ludicrous that god would would say to the human family to procreate have children have
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:10.600]  a family have a home and then not give them the responsibility and the duty to protect
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:16.040]  and provide for that family in the new testament the scripture says if a man provide not for
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:22.720]  his own he is worse than infidel he's denied the faith okay so provision of course going
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:28.760]  to work having a job making an income providing food and clothing and nourishment and and
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:34.640]  and housing and so forth but also protection protecting our families from the criminal
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.060]  element of society look at england where a guy's getting his head sawed off for like
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:46.160]  15 minutes and 30 people stand around taking photos not even having empathy but the basics
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:51.680]  of civilization is defending your family the whole bible is examples of people defending
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:55.740]  themselves and god's saying who will stand up for you know for me against the wicked
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:27:01.520]  ones if you were to take out the stories of the bible where you find an example of one
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:08.160]  of god's men resisting evil evil authority and sometimes with arms i mean look jeff to
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:14.080]  samson uh gideon take a take all the judges look look at the life look at abram abram
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:17.320]  went look at david the philistines said that was their land he should have knelt to them
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:22.520]  yes jesus should have done what they said in the garden of eden for example the verse
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:26.700]  that they often use when jesus told simon peter to put up his sword they that live by
[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:29.700]  the sword die by the sword that's the verse that they always by the way all these verses
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:36.520]  are covered in this book we go all the verses that they use to to justify passing it'll
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:41.000]  always say right before or right after what it actually means so we use all that for example
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:46.920]  jesus said right before that passage he told the disciples that they didn't have a sword
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:53.560]  to sell their clothes and go buy one okay jesus commanded them to buy a sword a roman
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:28:00.820]  sword now understand too alex that the roman sword was a military instrument that the jewish
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:05.020]  people were not allowed to carry under roman law he was saying get illegal weapons he was
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:10.640]  saying get an illegal weapon a military style weapon the best most deadliest short sword
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:14.320]  out there that's right the most effective efficient self-defense tool in the world at
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:18.720]  that time and he and he actually told him commanded them to go buy one even though the
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:23.960]  roman law said you couldn't have one so that this shoot but that's just jesus i mean he's
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:28.840]  that's the son of god you know it's we're talking about a complete misunderstanding
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:33.400]  when jesus told simon peter to put up the sword notice he did not tell him to give up
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:38.080]  his sword okay again an illegal weapon he's already carrying it with him there were two
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:43.200]  swords among the 11 apostles as you know it was time for christ to make the sacrifice
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:47.480]  right so that wasn't the time to fight exactly right it wasn't the time to fight jesus came
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:52.280]  to die to give his life a ransom for the sins of mankind he made that very clear the disciples
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:58.120]  didn't understand that jesus did he was telling simon put up your sword it's not time to use
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:03.200]  it i have come to give my life i've come to be arrested i've come to to be crucified but
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:07.000]  that's why he was just crying in the in the garden but notice that he also alex whenever
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.760]  the soldiers came why didn't they arrest simon peter when he cut off the ear i mean that
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:15.160]  would have been attempted murder if you were going to make a legal charge out of that that
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:18.920]  would have been attempted murder because i wanted them to go on and be witnesses right
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:22.280]  but why didn't they arrest simon why didn't they arrest the disciples why didn't they
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:27.640]  disarm him why did simon peter leave with his sword because christ had the miracle and
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:32.240]  because christ had knocked the soldiers on their can with the power of his voice and
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:37.680]  he protected the disciples and their ability to keep their arms so the witnesses could
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:42.000]  be there exactly absolutely we'll be right back and most people read the bible they don't
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.160]  get how deep it is i mean there's no literature like it because it's not literature they're

[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:36.720]  you need to get this book to every pastor you know and every youth pastor and everybody
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:41.840]  going to seminary I don't care whether they're Catholic Protestant Mormon Easter bunnies
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:48.960]  whatever they are this is the Bible and 77% some numbers they say 80% identify as Christian
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.800]  I can get pastor Baldwin to give me his numbers they claim to be Christian I'm not up here
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:58.440]  on some high horse I just know that they have taken over our big churches and they I mean
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:02.960]  I'd go to them my wife still goes to big churches in town and the overall will be good stuff
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:07.160]  it's still a bunch of government worship at the end of it and their argument is well we're
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:11.160]  going to save souls and everything goes to hell at least we'll have the soul saved people
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:15.280]  are going to be deceived by all this evil if they don't know the big picture this government
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:21.440]  is pure evil at the top they're aborting babies you know after they're born they're wanting
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:27.320]  to kill them up to age three now the Journal of Pediatrics publishes papers on that these
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:32.600]  are not liberals and the so-called conservatives are just the placeholders for them so we think
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.600]  we have an opposition to all of this and I like Senator Cruz coming out and saying our
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:41.240]  big problem is the Republican Party we can beat the Democrats our big part our big problem
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:48.240]  is the establishment people like Senator Graham and others Lindsey Graham our problem are
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:53.760]  people like Franklin Graham I mean it is incredible all the government arms of the teeth and does
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:58.560]  all this saying we shouldn't be armed so this book to keep or not to keep why Christians
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.900]  should not give up their guns I mean unbelievable I mean why do we supposedly have a military
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:08.120]  to find other evil governments well if governments are all ordained by God then how is that the
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:13.880]  case no if you become evil God will turn your society over and let the evil take over am
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:18.240]  I correct in saying that pastor Baldwin you're exactly correct Alex and let's not forget
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:24.300]  that the very the very fact that when you have a military or police that most Christians
[02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:29.560]  and most conservatives would recognize the right to enforce the law and and to defend
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:35.640]  the community or the nation as the case may be that all of that derives its legitimacy
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:42.920]  from we the people okay they have the right to defend the country and to defend the community
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:50.480]  with force because we as individuals created in the image of God have the right to protect
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:55.560]  our lives we created a government duly constituted amongst men to secure our liberties and they
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:01.000]  are our servants that we have created a professional force but the now that professional forces
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.300]  not become our king the point though is that Christians need to realize that if they really
[02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:11.320]  believe that the military and police have the right to bear arms and to protect society
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:16.040]  and protect the nation they only have that right because they got it from us it is an
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:21.240]  individual god-given right first yeah we got it from God and it became a collective right
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:29.040]  as we the people ceded to them that authority but it stems and and grows from we the people
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:34.200]  it's an individual right given to us by God if if we don't have a right to defend ourselves
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:38.720]  individually then the military does not have a right to defend the country collectively
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:43.480]  or the police does not have the right to defend the community collectively they only have
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.800]  that right collectively because we have the right individually as it was given to us by
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:52.000]  God and that's the disconnect the Christians just don't seem to understand well you're
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:58.840]  you're empowering evil when you say good people can't have weapons because they will follow
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:04.280]  that law and you've just empowered evil well not only that I think it's it's it shows a
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:08.500]  utter ignorance on the behalf of the pastors and the Christians of the country who haven't
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:13.540]  studied the principles of natural law as given to us by God the seminaries haven't taught
[02:39:13.540 --> 02:39:18.000]  it to baba khan I mean look I've been through all that you know I grew up in that I mean
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.800]  I how did you wake up then when was that you know it's a long process I mean we all met
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:28.700]  mature at different rates and different levels but I guess it was probably 1994 when Clinton
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:34.280]  first got elected I started my radio show he was like to 92 I started my show in 94
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:38.460]  I started scouring the the news and started you know getting involved I started listening
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:42.000]  to you and I started hearing a lot of the other things that were going on in the country
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.880]  doing my own research doing my own study because you don't learn this in school I had to go
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:50.000]  into the Bible search it for myself I had to do a lot of self-study and as I began to
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:55.260]  grow and I began to learn I realized how much I didn't know and I began to develop an appreciation
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:59.880]  for where we are as a people in terms of where we were in our history well it's certainly
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:04.520]  advanced now I learned a lot watching your your sermons and I mean I sit there I don't
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:07.680]  usually get to watch them when they first happen live I watch them a day or two after
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:13.480]  my wife watches them and people go to Chuck Baldwin live.com but also find them on YouTube
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:18.280]  right yeah we put all of our sermons up on YouTube now almost the same day we we have
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.240]  a technical crew that puts them up either on Sunday night or very early on Monday morning
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:26.960]  so usually by Monday morning they're already up on YouTube I want to you know tonight I
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:31.120]  think I'm gonna because I mean it's my nature I get excited tell people and then I run off
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:36.480]  you know at the mouth of a bunch of points which is good but also bad I want to I think
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:39.840]  one of the other crews doing the news segment I was going to interview with you tonight
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:45.280]  on TV I think what I should do is just introduce you and maybe you can preach a sermon tonight
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:53.320]  on info wars nightly news you want to do that wow I'll bring a lectern in there if you want
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:56.640]  Alex I'm your servant whatever you want me to do I don't want to worry out because but
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:59.640]  you said you're here to work you want to work yeah I mean we're gonna do this radio show
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:02.960]  we're gonna do the interview for Obama deception and then you can give an hour-long sermon
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:08.040]  if you want yeah whatever you want me to do but I what I want your audience to know is
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:13.400]  the importance of this book and how it can change the course of the church look in the
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:19.520]  first 48 to 72 hours after the book was released a sizable percentage of the orders that we
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:24.760]  got Alex were from pastors that's encouraging that's encouraging that what they're saying
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  is look we know in our heart that we have the right to keep and bear arms we know in
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:32.880]  our heart we have the right to defend ourselves we know in our heart that it's wrong for the
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:38.040]  government to tell us to surrender our semiautomatic rifles but where in the scripture do we find
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.660]  that they've never been taught and so that's why this book is so important it shows them
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:48.820]  in the scripture where the Bible gives them the authority under natural law and revealed
[02:41:48.820 --> 02:41:51.640]  but a lot of these preachers are so government control they'll probably say the Bible is
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.760]  of the devil well the preachers that are government control they're gonna say Obama is Jesus those
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:00.640]  those people I don't know if there's any hope for them the only hope for that is if you're
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:03.520]  in a church like that you need to get out well I'll tell you we've discovered Bill and
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:10.120]  Melinda Gates are funding a lot of these churches and you know he's a big collectivist and eugenicist
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:16.280]  and they send in now from the central churches the Methodist and others they send in change
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:22.520]  agents that are not even atheist but they're up there running the whole thing and I'm sure
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:27.480]  you know about this phenomenon where they're actually just cold-blooded operatives they're
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:33.420]  incrementally trying to keep the church there to be basically a Soviet army but by increments
[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:37.480]  they're they're basically re-educating people well even the ones that aren't even your typical
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:41.120]  501c no but I'm telling you there are a lot of them that are operatives oh I believe that
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:45.080]  no I'm not I don't I don't have any doubt about that and we all know about the pastor
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:50.720]  what's it called clergy response team the theme has been doing I've got a lot of pastors
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:54.520]  that have given me first-hand testimony about that oh tell us about that tell us about that
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:58.600]  or or don't forget tonight because we got the documents and later people didn't believe
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:02.040]  me and then it was on the news right they go oh turn your guns in it's of the Lord oh
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:06.040]  yeah absolutely during an emergency you turn the guns in no that's that's all that's written
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:09.160]  I mean they've got that in their training no but I want to hear what the preachers you
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:12.640]  briefly the preachers you know what did they say I'll be glad to and that's chilling yeah
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:17.800]  but the point is is that even the ones that are just your typical 501c3 pastor they really
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:23.480]  have been buffaloed into thinking that that somehow or another that because they're 501c3
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:27.240]  they can't say this they can't say that they can't be involved in politics they can't take
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:33.560]  a stand it's an intimidation factor and and as a result they are afraid to broach well
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:37.200]  it's political correctness I mean I was at Martin Springs this weekend and there was
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:40.360]  a Hispanic guy and two white guys swimming around and their girlfriends were up on the
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:45.400]  bank and one of them goes let's get Chinese food we leave here and the two white guys
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:48.560]  said of the Hispanic is just the white guys that are so politically you know correct they
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:54.000]  go don't you can't say Chinese and they weren't joking and now people think everything is
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.440]  like racist or something and it's the same thing once you get yourself in that box the
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:03.200]  box only gets smaller to where you're afraid to talk about anything yeah and that's where
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:07.360]  these guys are they really are afraid to talk about it and a lot of them have never studied
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:11.480]  it they've never been taught it they don't know the first thing about the principles
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:15.640]  of natural law they don't know the first thing about the principles of freedom and liberty
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:20.800]  everything that the founding fathers understood from from a historical and a spiritual perspective
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.960]  even the ones that were not Christians they understood the biblical principles of liberal
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:30.760]  that's why that's what's missing today that's what this book helps to to resolve this book
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:36.400]  Alex I believe if enough Christians and pastors would read it it would revolutionize the church
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.080]  and if it revolutionizes the church it could change the course of the country and that's
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:45.400]  up to the listeners to get the book at info war store.com and to go hand deliver it in
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:50.000]  a month later say did you read that and if the pastor hasn't done that I'm not a big
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.800]  guy into breaking up churches but these aren't even churches how do people make an issue
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:59.040]  hand out flyers call for a church meeting about it I mean how do you make these churches
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:04.320]  stop being a new world order mouthpiece well the first of all if you are a freedom lover
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:10.820]  and you're attending one of these silent sheepish 501c3 churches leave it get out vote with
[02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:14.880]  your feet you know they continue to give their tithes and offerings they continue to support
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:18.880]  what do you tell people I'm also I'm leaving because of this yeah absolutely they need
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:24.320]  to know they need to know that they are not being the shepherd to their flock that God
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:28.600]  would have them to be and as a result the sheep are not going to stay with that shepherd
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:32.840]  they need to understand that as long as they have the crowds and the money and the buildings
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:37.480]  and the notoriety what is the motivation they have to make any difference in what they're
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:41.360]  doing they're not going to change anything but if enough people out there in the congregation
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:46.000]  said look it's so late in the day preacher our country is going to hell in a handbasket
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.620]  we're about to lose our freedoms your kids and mine are going to grow up in tyranny if
[02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:55.440]  we you and me if we don't do something about it now and if you're not going to take a stand
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:00.300]  for my kids and for my grandkids and for the freedom of this country according to the scriptures
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:03.960]  that God has given you as a watchman on the wall then I'm gonna go find a shepherd who
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:08.520]  will and if enough people did that I think at least the pastors would say wait well wait
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:14.060]  a minute there's something here I'm missing it's incredible I want you to go over some
[02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:18.920]  of the verses that you've got in the book to keep or not to keep why Christians should
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:23.440]  not give up their guns are written with your constitutional lawyer sign Timothy Baldwin
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:28.520]  again Chuck Baldwin the pastor is here with us I mean this is really the fight folks let's
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.840]  I mean there's hundreds of them in here but let's get into some of these scriptures and
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:36.120]  then some of the scriptures they use to go after the guns okay well let's go to page
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:42.960]  72 and 73 we touched on it just briefly before in the last segment I mean if you live by
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:46.960]  the sword you'll die by the sword what Jesus said in the Garden of Eden and they take that
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:53.160]  to mean well if you use the sword in any way then you're wrong you're sinful you shouldn't
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:58.400]  do it and that's why that's what Jesus said to Simon Peter in the garden when actually
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.000]  the opposite is true well then how do you send the military off of the sword it's just
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.360]  totally hypocritical what Jesus was saying though he was saying well if you live by the
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:10.760]  sword you die by the sword Alex what he was saying was that the tyrants they live by the
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:18.820]  sword offensively that's right they live by the sword by inflicting harm upon others through
[02:47:18.820 --> 02:47:23.360]  brute force and we have the sword for defense as a result they will die by the sword and
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:28.040]  that verse is repeated in Revelation chapter 13 in verse 10 and it says the same thing
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:32.840]  again and he's talking about that is not that was not a warning to Simon Peter that was
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:37.960]  a promise to Simon Peter he was saying to Simon look it's not time for you to use saying
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:42.100]  vengeance is mine that's right it's not time for you to use the sword now because I came
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:47.160]  to die and give my life a ransom for the for the souls of men you put up your sword but
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.380]  they that live by the sword these tyrants that enforce their will by the by the edge
[02:47:51.380 --> 02:47:56.000]  of the sword they are going to because next he says go and buy a Roman sword now he said
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.680]  that before that he said before that go buy a sword and there were already two of the
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:03.420]  disciples that were carrying swords Simon Peter was the other one I think probably Matthew
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:07.080]  was the second one Jesus told the rest of them and by the way if they caught you with
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:11.880]  a sword they would crucify well it was against the law it was against Roman law so he said
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:17.360]  break unconstitutional assault weapon bans exactly but that's Jesus we should we should
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:22.480]  listen to the preacher not him yeah Jesus did I mean that's something that most people's
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:26.860]  most pastors just have never thought about and up to your honest out there ask your pastor
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:32.540]  do you realize when Jesus told his disciples to buy a sword he was talking about the Roman
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:37.800]  sword the most efficient effective defense self-defense tool in the world is a military
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:44.160]  style weapon he was telling them to purchase a weapon that the Roman government had forbade
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:49.280]  the Jewish people from owning and possessing he was requiring them that they break human
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:54.060]  law in order to fill that God's law now that is something that most pastors have never
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:58.200]  even thought about and it's we know it's the same sword because in the Greek language the
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:04.000]  same word is used when Jesus said the sword as as it was in Romans 13 when he talked about
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:08.760]  the government they they bear not the sword in vain he's talking about the government
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:13.240]  and Romans 13 well plus he's saying render unto Caesar that's what you Caesar whose faces
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:17.680]  on it it's the government's currency so of course they control it he's saying it's like
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:23.280]  you know using Federal Reserve notes my point is is that it's the same word the same word
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:28.480]  for sword that he used when he told the disciples to go but Daniel it's the same word the annual
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:31.920]  should have done what he was told about going to lion's den the other people shouldn't have
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:35.240]  gone in the fiery furnace they should don't they were told according to these preachers
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:39.440]  yeah I mean take all this John the Baptist should have done what Herod said all of this
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:45.400]  take all of the stories out of the Bible where you have an example of a of a God's one of
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:53.000]  God's people resisting evil authority resisting the law and you're going to take out a sizable
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.640]  portion of the Bible in fact I would in a general way I would say find me a major Bible
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:03.040]  character that did not reason I think because I've read the whole Bible quite a bit I'm
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:08.320]  not as much as you I'd say 70% of the Bible I mean Moses should have done what Pharaoh
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:15.780]  said he resisted he was a bad person Moses when he according to Hebrews he chose to suffer
[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:21.560]  affliction with the people of God rather than joy the pleasures of sin for a season is steaming
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:28.680]  the riches of Christ the reproach of Christ excuse me greater riches when did he do that
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:34.300]  he did that when he killed the Egyptian taskmaster who was murdering the Jewish slave he protected
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:39.120]  someone he protect he should have helped the the taskmaster kill the old man if if the
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:44.120]  rest of the Hebrews would have understood what Moses was doing they would have joined
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:48.760]  him at that point and they would have saved themselves from 40 years of tyranny but because
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:54.760]  they wouldn't follow Moses then they had to go through 40 more years of tyranny unbelievable
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:58.800]  you heard it Moses was evil he defended an old person you're not supposed to do that
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:02.920]  you're supposed to let the government kill them hello this is Ty Bollinger author of

[03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:49.120]  went into the book for me where are we are we at the crossroads the jump point the event horizon
[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:52.720]  are we about to enter it because everyone in their spirit can feel the quickening no there's
[03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:57.040]  no question about it i think we're definitely at the crossroads and and i think that that's
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:02.960]  one of the reasons why uh we see so many people moving to our area there in the flathead valley
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:07.920]  of montana we've since we've been there three years ago we've had scores of families that have
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:12.960]  that have come to the flathead valley they didn't know each other it was it was just something
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:18.640]  inside of them that caused them to to leave their home their their businesses their friends or
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:23.280]  family come thousands of miles go to flathead valley because they know in their heart that
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:28.720]  things are at a at a at a tipping point they don't know exactly what and when but they know that
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:33.680]  things are going to be happening very soon and they feel in their spirit they need to say this
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:38.400]  be where we are in the redoubt area of the montana people whether they move to montana or whether
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:44.800]  they don't the people understand that in their heart in their spirit things are at a critical
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:49.680]  juncture in our country and that's why i think it's so important that that what we're doing what
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:53.200]  you're doing i mean you're providing the news every day you're providing the inspiration you
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:57.760]  got the videos you got uh you got the audio you got radio television you got all this thing that
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:02.320]  you're doing you're a great staff what we're doing on our end is you know i left a church that i
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:08.640]  pastored for 35 years in florida it was a 501c3 a big one it was it was fairly large we went to
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:16.240]  montana to the flathead valley and started a non-501c3 church we broadcast our service
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:20.560]  every sunday afternoon at 230 mountain time we have people that are watching us all over the
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:24.880]  united states because they're people that are trying to find a patriot pastor and they can't
[03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:30.080]  find one that is so sad it is and but we're providing we're doing what you're doing in a
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:36.160]  different you ought to start a patriot seminary oh boy you know i i've thought about something
[03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:40.640]  like that the workload that that would take would be awesome i i don't know i i am praying
