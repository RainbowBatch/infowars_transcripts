[00:17.680 --> 00:22.160]  It gives international leaders time to talk before taking more action on the worldwide
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.520]  financial crisis.
[00:23.520 --> 00:29.000]  As for any Americans considering protecting just our own, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.600]  says isolationism and protectionism are not the way to contain the damage.
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.000]  Correspondent Tim McGuire is covering the World Bank meeting in Washington.
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.680]  Politicians and economists want to avoid at all costs the go-to-loan protectionist approach
[00:42.680 --> 00:46.240]  that made things so much worse during the Great Depression.
[00:46.240 --> 00:49.720]  The World Bank's Policy Board is meeting today in Washington.
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.120]  The group has already issued a warning that the global economic crisis is a greater threat
[00:54.120 --> 00:56.000]  to the poorest nations.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.400]  That's because they're already racked by growing food and fuel costs, and bigger countries
[01:00.400 --> 01:03.200]  may not be able to help them survive.
[01:03.200 --> 01:04.800]  Tim McGuire, Washington.

[01:20.760 --> 01:22.520]  Money won't protect you.
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.720]  Position won't save you.
[01:24.720 --> 01:28.040]  Your children's future is nil.
[01:28.040 --> 01:30.960]  Our nation must change its direction.

[02:13.040 --> 02:18.160]  Forest, one that's forced the evacuation of some 1,200 people, 20 miles north of downtown
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.160]  LA.
[02:19.160 --> 02:22.520]  In addition to the people, there were large animal evacuations, so we had fire trucks going
[02:22.520 --> 02:27.400]  in, hotshot crews going in, aircraft overhead, and horse trailers that were bringing those
[02:27.400 --> 02:28.400]  animals out.
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.400]  The U.S. Forest Service says firefighters are now gaining ground on a fire.
[02:32.400 --> 02:37.760]  In northern California, authorities say a rock struck by a car ignited a wildfire in
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.720]  California's Napa Valley that destroyed a home and a barn and threatened several wineries.
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.520]  The car's owner tried to extinguish the fire when it broke out Friday afternoon, but strong
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.040]  winds in the hills near the town of St. Helena caused the fire to spread quickly.
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.400]  Full containment expected today, and Pirates of Somalia have apparently fought off an
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.000]  attempt by Somali forces to retake a ship seized for ransom last Thursday.

[03:47.520 --> 03:51.040]  Abbas says no one is happy to see the current divisions continuing.
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.840]  He added no one would ever respect us if we go on.
[03:53.840 --> 03:57.080]  A reconciliation already appears in the works.
[03:57.080 --> 04:00.520]  Zimbabwe appears to be headed back into political crisis.

[04:54.600 --> 04:56.480]  inspections at will.
