[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.160]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.160 --> 00:45.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. It is Friday, the fifth day already, hard to believe, of
[00:45.680 --> 00:54.240]  April 2013, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours. I've got Chuck Baldwin,
[00:54.240 --> 01:01.960]  a former Constitution Party candidate, joining us, coming up at the bottom of the next hour
[01:01.960 --> 01:07.400]  to get into the Southern Baptist Convention, the official Vatican newspapers here in the
[01:07.400 --> 01:13.800]  United States, you name it, calling for an abolition of the Second Amendment. Absolutely
[01:13.800 --> 01:21.400]  state-run, government-controlled religious groups in this country, truly despicable.
[01:21.400 --> 01:26.360]  And if so-called Christians put up with this, next, they won't just be saying abortion's
[01:26.360 --> 01:32.400]  good, they'll be saying human sacrifice is good. And I'm not joking when I say that.
[01:32.400 --> 01:38.880]  I see an Associated Press headline, they're restricting the use of the term Islamicist.
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.400]  Can't even call al-Qaeda terrorists now, because they're the good guys overthrowing Libya and
[01:44.400 --> 01:52.080]  Syria. And now you can call anybody that wants liberty a right-wing extremist or a constitutionalist
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.440]  and extremist. That's the new bad group, officially. And I'm gonna be getting more into this case
[01:58.440 --> 02:05.000]  of this family who are our listeners. We've confirmed it in Florida, all over the news,
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.080]  kidnapped children, government extremists, anti-government extremists, kidnapped children,
[02:11.080 --> 02:13.480]  yes, their own children.
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.280]  They claim they took their children, their two little boys, because they found a small
[02:18.280 --> 02:26.520]  amount of marijuana. The government's going to take your children for a small amount of
[02:26.520 --> 02:32.400]  marijuana and they hadn't gotten them back over a year later. That is a predatory government
[02:32.400 --> 02:39.100]  that publicly grows the opium and loads it on the C-130s in Afghanistan to fly heroin
[02:39.100 --> 02:43.920]  into America, onto the streets and into your son's and daughter's veins.
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.800]  This is a totally sickening joke. But again, everybody knows the government deals drugs.
[02:48.800 --> 02:53.280]  They have congressional hearings admitting it. And then they have a public policy poll
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.400]  going, do you believe the conspiracy theory, the government's involved in drugs? I mean,
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.960]  they've busted, I've had Serpico on.
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.560]  He said everyone in the narcotics division of the detectives, everyone but him was dealing
[03:08.560 --> 03:16.200]  drugs, everyone. And he wouldn't do it, so they shot him in the face, Frank Serpico.
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.740]  I grew up and the police dealt the drugs, and I didn't use them. I tried one or two
[03:22.740 --> 03:25.900]  and hated the way it made me feel. I feel terrible when I'm on this, and the next day
[03:25.900 --> 03:30.720]  I feel like I was running for my truck. No, thank you. And I'd say, what are you doing?
[03:30.720 --> 03:36.760]  We're raiding our party saying you're looking for drugs. You sell drugs. Did I go to jail
[03:36.760 --> 03:41.800]  or did I go to jail?
[03:41.800 --> 03:48.400]  And I'm just calling all the bull. I'm done. I'm done. I'm calling it all. I'm done. I
[03:48.400 --> 03:54.840]  physically didn't even get angry yesterday. I got physically ill yesterday watching all
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.240]  the newscasts just talking trash about two parents that had the will and the courage
[03:59.240 --> 04:01.240]  to get their kids back from an evil government.
[04:01.240 --> 04:05.820]  I mean, if you save somebody from a Nazi death camp, you better believe it was on the radio
[04:05.820 --> 04:14.040]  that terrorists had stolen a prisoner. I mean, if aliens sat down in flying saucers and said,
[04:14.040 --> 04:17.760]  anyone that doesn't help us are terrorists, I guarantee you, your neighbors, if you were
[04:17.760 --> 04:24.480]  against the aliens, would rat you out to them. Guaranteed. Guaranteed.
[04:24.480 --> 04:30.000]  I'd say half the public, if blood drinking aliens landed and said, give us children to
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.140]  stick a straw in and drink their blood and we won't kill you, your neighbors would come
[04:34.140 --> 04:40.980]  grab your children and deliver them bowing to the aliens. Great bubble snap. Here is
[04:40.980 --> 04:47.560]  the child drink their blood. I mean, I'm serious. I'm serious. These are collaborator enemies
[04:47.560 --> 04:50.080]  and just we need to call them out for what they are.
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.340]  Break the trance and realize we got tyranny running wild and now wants to shut down the
[04:54.340 --> 05:00.600]  real media. The latest on North Korea. It's all coming up.
[05:00.600 --> 05:04.980]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[05:04.980 --> 05:10.080]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[05:10.080 --> 05:15.600]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[05:15.600 --> 05:20.680]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[05:20.680 --> 05:25.520]  at info worst team dot com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose
[05:25.520 --> 05:30.560]  thirty seven pounds in just two months.

[05:35.420 --> 05:40.180]  Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than thirty seven pounds in just

[07:02.140 --> 07:07.780]  huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us
[07:07.780 --> 07:12.300]  20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in
[07:12.300 --> 07:16.820]  more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will

[08:38.140 --> 08:46.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this fifth day of April 2013. It is
[08:46.660 --> 08:52.340]  Friday and coming up in the second half of the broadcast. Pastor Chuck Baldwin is going
[08:52.340 --> 08:57.220]  to be joining us to discuss all the major denominations from Catholic to the Southern
[08:57.220 --> 09:01.940]  Baptist Convention, calling for the end of the Second Amendment and basically the end
[09:01.940 --> 09:08.240]  of America. This is the great move ahead of the new global wars they're about to start.
[09:08.240 --> 09:14.660]  The implosion of the world economy in every nationally sovereign state and the ushering
[09:14.660 --> 09:21.900]  in of the one world government. And the church is all lining up again to worship abortion,
[09:21.900 --> 09:27.060]  to worship gun control, to worship the end of marriage, to just worship tyranny period
[09:27.060 --> 09:32.500]  and to openly call for world government, as the Vatican is now doing. Here is the CNN
[09:32.500 --> 09:39.140]  headline report. North Korea loads missiles on to launchers, and they're talking about
[09:39.140 --> 09:42.020]  nuclear war by next Wednesday.
[09:42.020 --> 09:47.560]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, they're talking about nuclear war. We're not talking about
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.500]  nuclear war. The establishment is two medium range missiles have been loaded onto mobile
[09:52.500 --> 09:58.860]  launchers in North Korea and are ready to be launched. South Korea's semi official Yonhap
[09:58.860 --> 10:06.060]  News Agency reported today, citing military sources in Seoul. By the way, we have a correspondent
[10:06.060 --> 10:10.380]  in Seoul, South Korea and we're working on that right now.
[10:10.380 --> 10:16.320]  A US official, not a servant, but official with direct knowledge of the information told
[10:16.320 --> 10:22.100]  CNN on Thursday that missiles and launch components have been moved to the east coast of North
[10:22.100 --> 10:27.860]  Korea in the last few days. And again, that would be able to target the west coast of
[10:27.860 --> 10:32.540]  the United States or be able to obviously hit Japan, it's much closer. In response,
[10:32.540 --> 10:36.820]  South Korea has sent Aegis destroyers equipped with advanced radar systems into both its
[10:36.820 --> 10:39.960]  coast, Yonhap said, citing Navy sources.
[10:39.960 --> 10:43.580]  The apparent deployment comes amid further threatening statements by North Korea and
[10:43.580 --> 10:48.860]  heightened intentions in the region, a situation that does not need to get any hotter, US State
[10:48.860 --> 10:53.700]  Department said. Why did the State Department authorized with the UN then in the mid 90s,
[10:53.700 --> 11:00.740]  ABB, the nuclear reactor company, the multinational company headed by Donald Rumsfeld to transfer
[11:00.740 --> 11:06.020]  the reactors to him to get the fissile material to make the atomic bomb warheads, primitive
[11:06.020 --> 11:12.120]  warheads, the 1950s science level warheads.
[11:12.120 --> 11:15.740]  Why was that dumb and there were reactors they could have been quote given the last
[11:15.740 --> 11:19.540]  time they were holding the world hostage. You're threatening war with the south the
[11:19.540 --> 11:26.220]  conventional weapons, here, let us give you reactors to make a bombs. I guarantee you
[11:26.220 --> 11:29.380]  when we're in some new giant wars with Al Qaeda that's being given the entire Middle
[11:29.380 --> 11:33.500]  East right now, a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, four years
[11:33.500 --> 11:40.980]  from now, it will be a conspiracy theory that the West put Al Qaeda in those countries.
[11:40.980 --> 11:47.500]  It'll be how dare Alex Jones claim Al Qaeda was put in by us and I'll be like I have LA
[11:47.500 --> 11:54.780]  Times, Associated Press, Reuters, CFR from 2010, 11 and 12, 13. Here they, shut up, traitor,
[11:54.780 --> 12:08.580]  shut up, traitor. Yeah, there's London Guardian dealing with the, that's talking about in
[12:08.580 --> 12:13.980]  the news and him transferring stuff to him. He's doing it in 1995, 96. Anyways, it's just
[12:13.980 --> 12:20.620]  having a memory in a culture of people that don't even know which end is up.
[12:20.620 --> 12:26.300]  It's really weird. I mean, I guess I'm a heretic because I know sodium fluoride in the levels
[12:26.300 --> 12:31.100]  they put in the water and food are increasing cancer. They admit it. I know they're putting
[12:31.100 --> 12:36.540]  this phenol and the plastics in that type of plastic to reduce fertility. The White
[12:36.540 --> 12:41.940]  House science are brags about it. John P. Holdren, I mean, I know they're doing all
[12:41.940 --> 12:42.940]  this.
[12:42.940 --> 12:48.060]  I know they're bad. I know they plan to bring in global crises to sell total tyranny and
[12:48.060 --> 12:53.300]  the shutdown of the alternative media as the answer. And the shutdown of the old web with
[12:53.300 --> 12:59.560]  the new controlled Internet. It's all being announced. It's all happening. They're going
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.640]  to take your pension funds, all of it, all of it.
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.900]  You can have no independence. All of your pension fund, public or private, will be taken.
[13:08.900 --> 13:14.260]  All of your bank accounts will be taken and then your life will be taken. How do I know
[13:14.260 --> 13:18.780]  that? That's how tyrannies work. If they can get any of it, they're going to get it all.
[13:18.780 --> 13:24.380]  What did I say three weeks ago when the Cyprus thing started? I said, if they can get 10%
[13:24.380 --> 13:28.180]  people like, how dare you say that? They're not taking any money. That was the first response.
[13:28.180 --> 13:33.200]  It couldn't be true. I was reporting on foreign press. First few days, you're a liar, Alex.
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.640]  On my own website, infowars.com, the comments of trolls and spammers. Alex, you're making
[13:37.640 --> 13:44.820]  it up. Okay, they are taking the money 7.5%. It's not 10%, you dirty liar. Because they
[13:44.820 --> 13:49.220]  were covering articles from days before, it was then 10%, then it was 20, then it was
[13:49.220 --> 13:53.700]  30, then it was 40, then it was 50, then it was 60, then it was 70, then it was 80, then
[13:53.700 --> 13:57.380]  it was 90, then it was all the money out of your bank account.
[13:57.380 --> 14:02.180]  For many of the people that had accounts, the lowest number was 40% out of your bank
[14:02.180 --> 14:06.260]  account. And now they're saying they're gonna take more. And you notice at first they were
[14:06.260 --> 14:14.020]  like, yeah, tough bailout for snipers, but it's what it needs. Fox News reporting, I'm
[14:14.020 --> 14:19.220]  Shepard Smith or whatever his name is. That's right, and then a few days later, now they
[14:19.220 --> 14:20.220]  call it a bailout.
[14:20.220 --> 14:28.020]  They don't even say money out of the accounts on CNN, Fox, MSNBC. That's how it works, you
[14:28.020 --> 14:32.740]  see. And now it's a conspiracy theory, no, they didn't take money out in Cyprus. There's
[14:32.740 --> 14:38.940]  not 2 billion bullets. And of course, then it turned out that they sold it as we're gonna
[14:38.940 --> 14:41.580]  get the rich people's money when it was actually the poor people.
[14:41.580 --> 14:47.060]  Turns out hundreds and hundreds of mega rich that had their money there, all their money
[14:47.060 --> 14:52.500]  was taken out in the weeks and months before. Reuters reported, but I forgot it doesn't
[14:52.500 --> 15:01.260]  exist. I mean, this is the crazy land that we've gotten to. So they're now loading missiles
[15:01.260 --> 15:06.460]  onto the launchers, all embassies told to evacuate staff from North Korea, the British
[15:06.460 --> 15:12.180]  are pulling out.
[15:12.180 --> 15:20.020]  That is the type of information that is unfolding right now. And maybe this is like all the
[15:20.020 --> 15:24.940]  last threats. Remember Homeland Security about a month and a half ago, they were talking
[15:24.940 --> 15:32.700]  about cutting a Homeland Security's ever growing budget just to cut the growth of it.
[15:32.700 --> 15:35.780]  Just hundreds of billions of dollars a year conservatively, they said we're just gonna
[15:35.780 --> 15:43.460]  cut a few billion of your growth. And they said, okay, terrorist will hit us. Al-Qaeda
[15:43.460 --> 15:48.980]  working with the Tea Party, remember that was the headline, is going to hit America.
[15:48.980 --> 15:53.540]  And if anybody could think they'd go, the Tea Party's made up of mainly Islamophobes
[15:53.540 --> 15:57.300]  who gave up all their rights, believing they were gonna fight Al-Qaeda. Now the government
[15:57.300 --> 16:03.180]  publicly runs Al-Qaeda, so they're flipping it over to the Patriot movement, is the terrorist.
[16:03.180 --> 16:07.980]  But they came out and said, well, who's gonna hit us? Right wingers working with Al-Qaeda.
[16:07.980 --> 16:17.580]  Haven't you seen all the new dramas on ABC, CBS, and Fox, and Spike TV and everywhere
[16:17.580 --> 16:26.220]  else? I mean, on all the shows, the killers are gun owner patriots. Haven't you seen the
[16:26.220 --> 16:29.280]  medical shows?
[16:29.280 --> 16:38.820]  And then the cops are out there, and there's a Tea Party event in Louisiana. And people
[16:38.820 --> 16:42.340]  are visiting from Florida, husband and wife who are engineers, they have two little boys.
[16:42.340 --> 16:45.700]  So they raid the rooms of the people, it's just an anti-government thing. You're not
[16:45.700 --> 16:50.920]  allowed to have a Tea Party event at the hotel with speakers. Good agents, good maids went
[16:50.920 --> 16:56.300]  in and dug through stuff in the free country, and claim they found less than a gram of marijuana
[16:56.300 --> 16:59.140]  and a pipe.
[16:59.140 --> 17:03.980]  And so the children were taken, thank God, in our free country. If they catch you with
[17:03.980 --> 17:09.780]  marijuana, your children are taken, Air Force veterans, no criminal record. And then a year
[17:09.780 --> 17:14.260]  later, the government has the kids. And then now the parents went and took their kids back.
[17:14.260 --> 17:18.740]  Oh my gosh, can you imagine? There's only one thing worse than that. One time I went
[17:18.740 --> 17:23.460]  in the garage, and usually if I left the door open and forget to close it at night, raccoons
[17:23.460 --> 17:26.460]  go in to try to find the dog food.
[17:26.460 --> 17:32.820]  And the most evil thing that you've ever seen happens. If there's a mama raccoon or daddy
[17:32.820 --> 17:37.940]  raccoon in the garage, they're not mean about it, they'll just kind of run out. But if they
[17:37.940 --> 17:42.220]  brought their babies in with them and you try to get close, they just get their back
[17:42.220 --> 17:46.180]  against the wall. They won't leave and they start hissing and growling at you.
[17:46.180 --> 17:50.240]  And if you go up to them, they will attack you and bite you. And I think all raccoons
[17:50.240 --> 17:56.020]  should be executed, hunted down and put in FEMA camps, because there's nothing worse
[17:56.020 --> 17:59.980]  than wanting your babies to be safe. There's nothing worse than a parent wanting to be
[17:59.980 --> 18:04.500]  with their child.
[18:04.500 --> 18:09.540]  I mean, I think abortion is great in this country. I think it's great we've killed 53
[18:09.540 --> 18:14.460]  million babies. I think it's great now the Journal of Bioethics is calling to kill babies
[18:14.460 --> 18:18.620]  up to age three. I think it's great they're calling for death panels of old people. And
[18:18.620 --> 18:24.260]  I think it's great that all over the country, I know people. I'll be in a restaurant listening
[18:24.260 --> 18:29.140]  or I was at Barton Springs once and heard a couple going, it's just terrible.
[18:29.140 --> 18:34.960]  Yeah, I can't believe it. I mean, no criminal record. He's a professor. She's a scientist.
[18:34.960 --> 18:38.100]  She wanted to have her second child. They claim they found marijuana in her system.
[18:38.100 --> 18:42.040]  They took both their kids. Yeah, it's been two months. They hadn't seen them. And they're
[18:42.040 --> 18:47.660]  ending parental rights. Yeah, it's terrible. And then I'm in a restaurant and I start talking
[18:47.660 --> 18:51.860]  to the people. Or I'm in a restaurant and hear them going, yeah, they pulled him over
[18:51.860 --> 18:53.860]  and he had some marijuana in the car.
[18:53.860 --> 18:59.280]  Yeah, yeah, so they went to the house and took their kids. I mean, folks, the government
[18:59.280 --> 19:04.220]  ships the drugs in. It's trying to put your kids on Ritalin and Prozac type drugs that
[19:04.220 --> 19:09.700]  are deadly and cause heart palpitations, heart expansion, brain shrinkage, retardation of
[19:09.700 --> 19:13.260]  growth, mental illness, and it's speed.
[19:13.260 --> 19:17.900]  It's hallucinogens. They're putting deadly shots in the kids. Cancer is exploding off
[19:17.900 --> 19:22.780]  the chart. A wood alcohol aspartame in all the sugar candies now. You can't even not
[19:22.780 --> 19:27.860]  just find gum, but it's now going in milk, unlabeled aspartame, wood alcohol. It breaks
[19:27.860 --> 19:31.100]  down to wood alcohol at 87 degrees. The body's 98 plus.
[19:31.100 --> 19:37.060]  I mean, they're just murdering a ship, but oh, let them find you with marijuana. That's
[19:37.060 --> 19:41.100]  why they want to act like marijuana is legalized. So you go and get it so they can take your
[19:41.100 --> 19:49.020]  kids. Marijuana is more illegal now than it's ever been. Do not smoke it and hate the government,
[19:49.020 --> 19:55.180]  hate the system, spit at them spiritually. Just we are under enemy bombardment and total
[19:55.180 --> 20:00.500]  attack and only a pure break with them will defeat them.

[21:06.500 --> 21:12.600]  that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking
[21:12.600 --> 21:17.820]  someone is home watching television as a recent widow living alone. It gives me great peace
[21:17.820 --> 21:22.900]  of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians
[21:22.900 --> 21:28.540]  will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home. Fake TV easily

[22:32.100 --> 22:35.880]  strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it
[22:35.880 --> 22:40.420]  lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct
[22:40.420 --> 22:44.080]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[22:44.080 --> 22:47.660]  of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar

[23:05.420 --> 23:11.020]  important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be
[23:11.020 --> 23:14.820]  sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this
[23:14.820 --> 23:20.660]  world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep

[23:57.500 --> 24:05.620]  It's the only one you've got. By the way, look at this article from WorldNet Daily.
[24:05.620 --> 24:10.660]  We've got it linked up on Infowars.com as well. Look what's posted on Piers Morgan's
[24:10.660 --> 24:15.580]  lawn. The last time we had the Veritas project on, they're the folks that brought down Acre
[24:15.580 --> 24:21.360]  and they told me off air they were going to go to his house. Pure genius, real reporting.
[24:21.360 --> 24:28.940]  Look what's posted on Piers Morgan's lawn. Sting video snags CNN advocate on grabbing
[24:28.940 --> 24:37.020]  guns. He has a armed response security system. So he has armed guards, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:37.020 --> 24:44.220]  That's a very expensive security to have. We've actually looked at it for our office,
[24:44.220 --> 24:51.980]  but why not just have us armed? So basically retired police generally or military with
[24:51.980 --> 24:55.260]  special permits for armed response for LA.
[24:55.260 --> 25:00.660]  They show up to his house, armed response. Piers Morgan, the resident gun control advocate
[25:00.660 --> 25:08.160]  of CNN, protects his own personal property with signs warning that it is guaranteed by
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.660]  an armed response security services. According to a new investigation by self-described guerrilla
[25:12.660 --> 25:18.700]  journalist James O'Keefe of the project Veritas, it's known for his undercover video operations.
[25:18.700 --> 25:23.340]  He recently exposed how journalists with a newspaper that revealed the addresses of gun
[25:23.340 --> 25:28.300]  permit holders in the New York City were unwilling to take a dose of their own medicine, declare
[25:28.300 --> 25:31.140]  their homes gun free zones.
[25:31.140 --> 25:37.360]  I'm telling you, these guys are the model of journalism. It's funny, I was talking to
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.980]  them off air about some stuff and I said, yeah, you ought to go out and show Piers Morgan's
[25:42.980 --> 25:46.580]  bodyguards. And they said, actually, we're on that. We're going there next week, but
[25:46.580 --> 25:52.780]  don't tell anybody. It's just like, bam. And I'll be honest with you, I've actually got
[25:52.780 --> 25:57.740]  reporters going out to LA. They've scooped us. I'm more than happy. We got guys going
[25:57.740 --> 26:06.420]  in. Well, I'm not going to say when. And that's on their list is to. I got to love it, man.
[26:06.420 --> 26:10.180]  You got to love it. You got to absolutely love it. I mean, that's how you deal with
[26:10.180 --> 26:14.900]  these hypocrites. And that's why they're so upset about the alternative media.
[26:14.900 --> 26:21.980]  In fact, Fox News is asking, is Drudge on the White House enemies list? And of course,
[26:21.980 --> 26:28.080]  the answer is yes, it came out, what, three years ago in the news that I'm on the enemies
[26:28.080 --> 26:32.740]  list. Drudge is on the enemies list. Oh, Breitbart's on there, but you can scratch him off. Yes,
[26:32.740 --> 26:38.260]  they got him. Oh, I'm sure they just announced how he died 45 minutes after he was at the
[26:38.260 --> 26:39.260]  hospital.
[26:39.260 --> 26:46.620]  That's just a telltale sign when they tell you that there's no foul play immediately
[26:46.620 --> 26:51.060]  that you've got some really suspicious stuff going on. But again, here's the good news
[26:51.060 --> 26:59.420]  in all of this. They wouldn't be freaking out. They wouldn't be coming after us with
[26:59.420 --> 27:04.500]  all their government controlled organs like Media Matters, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center,
[27:04.500 --> 27:06.260]  MSNBC, CNN.
[27:06.260 --> 27:11.900]  They wouldn't be demonizing infoawars.com if we weren't effective. So there's the good
[27:11.900 --> 27:20.300]  news. My grandpa was in the Army Air Corps. They had an old saying, he was flying out
[27:20.300 --> 27:23.720]  of North Africa into Italy. And then after they took over Italy, he was on the ground
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.240]  there. But the point is, did his 22 missions, was that they had an old saying, how do you
[27:28.240 --> 27:32.300]  know when you're over the target, it's when you're getting the flak.
[27:32.300 --> 27:36.060]  Because they put the flak around the factories and around the military bases. They put the
[27:36.060 --> 27:44.260]  big anti-aircraft guns and then they're shrapnel. They're like shells that go up and explode
[27:44.260 --> 27:48.160]  and they've got a bunch of pieces falling at hundreds of miles an hour through the air
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.900]  meant to knock out your windshields, go through your engines. And so how did you know where
[27:53.900 --> 28:02.980]  to bomb? Where you saw the flak coming up. You had to fly into the cloud of flak.
[28:02.980 --> 28:08.820]  And so where do you see the flak going up? Where do you see the flak coming in? The only
[28:08.820 --> 28:12.980]  real media in this country, does that mean I'm perfect? No. Does it mean these other
[28:12.980 --> 28:17.500]  sites are perfect like drugsreport.com? No. But you better believe and you better thank
[28:17.500 --> 28:23.020]  your lucky stars that infoawars.com and prisonplanet.com and infoawars nightly news.
[28:23.020 --> 28:27.220]  And this syndicated radio show and our AM and FM affiliates are out there because the
[28:27.220 --> 28:33.020]  show's growing. But all the time we'll be number one rated in the city or number two
[28:33.020 --> 28:38.220]  rated in the city. And they'll switch formats. Big money comes in and says, we'll pay you
[28:38.220 --> 28:43.460]  triple what you're making to put ESPN on and get rid of Alex Jones in this talk radio lineup
[28:43.460 --> 28:48.220]  in Orlando. They'll come in and they'll say, you know what, money on the table.
[28:48.220 --> 28:55.020]  Take Alex Jones off in Dallas. Just getting listeners isn't all it takes, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:55.020 --> 29:01.940]  I've gone uphill, uphill battle for 18, almost 18 years. I don't know, 1995, how many years
[29:01.940 --> 29:07.700]  is that? It's not quite 18, it's almost 18. For 18 years, ladies and gentlemen, just to
[29:07.700 --> 29:10.180]  get the platform we've got.
[29:10.180 --> 29:16.020]  And we've got the White House breathing down our neck. And if they could get local police
[29:16.020 --> 29:21.540]  to be corrupt and set us up, they would. I wouldn't last living in New York, guaranteed.
[29:21.540 --> 29:29.260]  I wouldn't last living in LA, folks, okay? I've even moved to a town outside Austin because
[29:29.260 --> 29:32.380]  I know what I'm doing.
[29:32.380 --> 29:38.340]  But the whole point here is, ladies and gentlemen, understand we're going in against the Death
[29:38.340 --> 29:42.880]  Star here in X-Wings. I mean, I hope you realize what you're watching here because there's
[29:42.880 --> 29:49.820]  not much opposition to this. We'll be right back.
[29:49.820 --> 30:00.820]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.820 --> 30:05.300]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[30:05.300 --> 30:10.380]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[30:10.380 --> 30:15.540]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[32:00.020 --> 32:05.260]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[32:05.260 --> 32:10.940]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[32:10.940 --> 32:16.100]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[32:16.100 --> 32:21.640]  the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com. These are items
[32:21.640 --> 32:27.060]  that I did research on that I personally use. We've got the life straw so you can turn

[33:00.340 --> 33:05.220]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[33:05.220 --> 33:09.540]  about guns in a vastly different way. It's not about keeping guns out of the hands of
[33:09.540 --> 33:14.540]  law abiding Americans and I'm sick and tired of people lying to the American people. We
[33:14.540 --> 33:20.660]  can't have a totally armed society. We're not proposing a gun registration system. We're
[33:20.660 --> 33:25.500]  proposing background checks for criminals. In the spirit of gun control will you disarm
[33:25.500 --> 33:30.660]  your entire security team? We'll get back to you. You'll get back to me? Hitler took
[33:30.660 --> 33:35.940]  the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns. Hugo Chavez
[33:35.940 --> 33:41.260]  took the guns and I'm here to tell you 1776 will commence again if you try to take our
[33:41.260 --> 33:45.220]  firearms. Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for
[33:45.220 --> 33:50.100]  them to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them. Do you understand? The answer

[34:58.760 --> 35:03.180]  support the real media. There's not a lot of real opposition to the globalist and the
[35:03.180 --> 35:11.420]  crime syndicate. But the opposition that's there, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, worldnetdaily.com,
[35:11.420 --> 35:12.900]  drudgereport.com.
[35:12.900 --> 35:17.640]  We are all on the White House enemies list that came out years ago. They are freaking
[35:17.640 --> 35:21.860]  out, it's coming out on C-SPAN that they're tracking what we're doing, they're upset about
[35:21.860 --> 35:26.980]  what's going on. They're saying the news on Drudge is causing us problems, because they
[35:26.980 --> 35:29.240]  cannot control the narrative anymore.
[35:29.240 --> 35:33.580]  They say they're not 2 billion bullets, there's no armored vehicles, there's no move towards
[35:33.580 --> 35:38.220]  a police state. Fast and Furious didn't happen, we keep reporting it, then they have to admit
[35:38.220 --> 35:46.820]  it was a false flag. It's all coming out. They have to have their takeover in a vacuum
[35:46.820 --> 35:48.540]  where there's no resistance.
[35:48.540 --> 35:54.300]  We're resisting, we have the truth, they're losing credibility. MSNBC's top shows, a million
[35:54.300 --> 36:00.740]  viewers, CNN's top shows, 500 to 600,000 viewers. Ladies and gentlemen, we have 3 million
[36:00.740 --> 36:05.260]  listeners a day. I'm not bragging, I'm saying I'm in danger, you're in danger. We're all
[36:05.260 --> 36:11.660]  in danger if we don't take action, because we're actually having an effect on these people.
[36:11.660 --> 36:15.500]  History isn't just evil, history has multi facets, those that aren't informed, those
[36:15.500 --> 36:20.700]  that aren't informed, the mercenaries, the truly evil, the truly virtuous. There's a
[36:20.700 --> 36:25.100]  lot of different factions out there, and there are different currents in this universe.
[36:25.100 --> 36:34.140]  You need to stand up for liberty, and evil will vanish like tyrants at daybreak, like
[36:34.140 --> 36:40.740]  mist, like phantoms at daybreak, to quote Thomas Jefferson. Now, we've got purges against
[36:40.740 --> 36:44.580]  gun owners and veterans. Veterans who've had their arms and legs blown off are having their
[36:44.580 --> 36:48.460]  kids taken. Veterans that are caught with even half a marijuana cigarette are having
[36:48.460 --> 36:50.460]  their children taken.
[36:50.460 --> 36:55.380]  Veterans are having their guns taken en masse. There is a domestic purge, like Nazi Germany
[36:55.380 --> 37:00.100]  started with, groups that were unpopular at first and expanded onto everyone. I've studied
[37:00.100 --> 37:05.380]  tyranny, it's happening next hour, I'm gonna get into that. But a big surprise, he's a
[37:05.380 --> 37:09.720]  smart guy, he knows he's monitored, so he was smart to get out of the country and then
[37:09.720 --> 37:10.720]  contact us.
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.880]  He said, I'm gonna have a surprise for you next week. I'm an expert on Korea, and I knew
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.620]  he was. He helped write Tom Clancy's books, co-authored him, has had a lot of his books
[37:18.620 --> 37:24.860]  turned into major hit, most in pictures. He has multiple degrees from what MIT and Harvard,
[37:24.860 --> 37:29.980]  I don't have his bio here in front of me today, and did write the book on modern psychological
[37:29.980 --> 37:34.460]  warfare for the State Department that was picked up by the CIA and others.
[37:34.460 --> 37:39.980]  He's negotiated major hostage rescue operations, he's run psyops, he's brought down foreign
[37:39.980 --> 37:43.860]  governments, that's all on record. He won't brag about it, but you can Google Dr. Steve
[37:43.860 --> 37:48.900]  Pacinek and find news articles about him. And no one's seen what he looks like in about
[37:48.900 --> 37:54.300]  20 years either, but we got a photo from him about 30 years ago. And of course, he is a
[37:54.300 --> 37:56.540]  member of the Council on Foreign Relations as well.
[37:56.540 --> 38:01.740]  But as he says, a mole in there against the globalist. He exposes that bin Laden was already
[38:01.740 --> 38:08.220]  dead, other false flags. And we get his email, we call the hotel, now he's out on the DMZ.
[38:08.220 --> 38:15.580]  Dr. Steve Pacinek is there with a sandstorm coming in out of the desert on the DMZ. He's
[38:15.580 --> 38:20.340]  watching troops coming in right now. And he can give you what he believes is the inside
[38:20.340 --> 38:26.620]  intel scoop from his contacts on what's really happening with the biggest crisis, the biggest
[38:26.620 --> 38:34.860]  saber rattling in the 60-year conflict, an ongoing conflict that is the North-South Korea
[38:34.860 --> 38:35.860]  proxy situation.
[38:35.860 --> 38:40.860]  So I'm gonna give him the floor now. Joining us from somewhere in South Korea, right on
[38:40.860 --> 38:46.940]  the DMZ, he is there. Dr. Pacinek, thank you for going there and reporting for us.
[38:46.940 --> 38:52.780]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thank you, America, for listening to me. What happened on last
[38:52.780 --> 38:56.680]  week's show, I was on Monday and we talked about stand-downs and all the other false
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.060]  flags. But I didn't want to give you the surprise that I knew the next day I would
[39:01.060 --> 39:06.200]  be headed out on my own money, my own time, without any assistance from anybody, straight
[39:06.200 --> 39:12.980]  into Seoul, Korea and up to the DMZ right now. I'm on the DMZ. It's about 1.40 a.m.
[39:12.980 --> 39:19.300]  in the morning on Saturday, so we're 11 hours ahead. What I see is a huge sandstorm
[39:19.300 --> 39:25.540]  coming in from the Gobi Desert of China and in a way that really is the metaphor for what's
[39:25.540 --> 39:32.980]  happening in Korea. China is the primary mover of North Korea. China is the responsible agent
[39:32.980 --> 39:39.400]  that creates Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un. The reason I went here was to
[39:39.400 --> 39:46.300]  show to the American public in real time, only through Alex Jones, how distorted our
[39:46.300 --> 39:53.220]  representation is of the media, how inappropriate and how agitation propaganda is being played
[39:53.220 --> 39:59.060]  through CNN, which I woke up to, and it was unbelievable. Wolf Blitzer, Farhan Akan,
[39:59.060 --> 40:03.560]  Amina Poor, all the people that we talked about who don't know absolutely nothing
[40:03.560 --> 40:09.180]  are being told by our military and our government to create a sense of panic and agitation that
[40:09.180 --> 40:15.740]  there would be a nuclear missile strike somewhere on the Pacific, possibly near Seattle, possibly
[40:15.740 --> 40:23.140]  on the East Coast, but the entire scenario is totally false. While I'm here, unofficially,
[40:23.140 --> 40:26.740]  but the Korean government has not stopped me because I've worked with them. Let me
[40:26.740 --> 40:31.260]  explain a little bit of my history. It's not just that I wrote about North Korea and
[40:31.260 --> 40:35.540]  I was here, but I was deputy assistant secretary of East Asia, which meant that Korea was under
[40:35.540 --> 40:42.820]  my jurisdiction, and I was the first person to actually work with. In the 1980s, a man
[40:42.820 --> 40:48.080]  by the name of Jeon Do Won, No Tae Woo, our own government didn't really remember this,
[40:48.080 --> 40:53.140]  and what that meant in simple language was I was able to help the military government
[40:53.140 --> 40:59.540]  of South Korea. That's the present president, a lady whose name is Park, whose father was
[40:59.540 --> 41:04.100]  assassinated in a military coup. I was able, with the assistance of the U.S. government,
[41:04.100 --> 41:09.980]  to transform the entire country of South Korea in the 1980s from a military dictatorship
[41:09.980 --> 41:17.900]  to a civilian one, and then eventually were brought in directly Kim Jong-Som and Kim Dae-Jung.
[41:17.900 --> 41:21.700]  There's a lot of names here, but those in the world will understand it in the South
[41:21.700 --> 41:28.020]  Koreans. I'm here in the DMZ zone, an unidentified area. I've been supported by the South Korean
[41:28.020 --> 41:33.300]  informally through my guides and others, but I've had the opportunity and the unique
[41:33.300 --> 41:37.540]  reason, and the reason I've done this, to really be able to co-opt and to explain to
[41:37.540 --> 41:42.740]  the Americans only through Alex Jones Show, and Alex and I are being paid. This goes back
[41:42.740 --> 41:47.400]  to our friendship and to the belief I have in that he's the only media that I can get
[41:47.400 --> 41:54.340]  the real truth, and as I'm seeing it now, I see brigades, possible brigades, about five
[41:54.340 --> 42:03.100]  to 10,000, 15,000 young South Korean soldiers moving in concert with half-tracks and tanks.
[42:03.100 --> 42:08.220]  The tanks are old. They're not modern. I interviewed, even though the military did
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.500]  not want to work with me. I asked for a formal request, although I came in very quickly to
[42:12.500 --> 42:16.580]  the Republic of Korea Army, which I knew very well, because I knew all of their generals.
[42:16.580 --> 42:22.420]  So you have to remember, America, that 20 to 30 years ago, Korea, South Korea, was run
[42:22.420 --> 42:28.700]  by a military dictatorship. The dictatorship was assassinated. I was not involved in it,
[42:28.700 --> 42:34.220]  but what I was was involved was the transforming of the dictatorship into civilian government,
[42:34.220 --> 42:39.040]  and now the leader of South Korea is a very elegant, very competent woman who is the daughter
[42:39.040 --> 42:46.420]  of the man who was the leading dictator by the name of Ms. Park. She in no way has interfered
[42:46.420 --> 42:52.340]  with my work. I was provided with a guy who speaks English, Russian, Japanese, and is
[42:52.340 --> 42:57.740]  extremely knowledgeable and was head of the major companies here, and I recruited him
[42:57.740 --> 43:03.180]  very quickly. He may be key to KCIA. He may, maybe not, but we went immediately up to the
[43:03.180 --> 43:09.500]  DMZ zone. I'm near the DMZ zone. I see the half-tracks coming in with tanks. The tanks
[43:09.500 --> 43:15.300]  are very low quality. They're not M1 Abrams, the very sophisticated one, but most importantly,
[43:15.300 --> 43:22.180]  I want to express the spree, the joy, and kind of the sadness of when you see young
[43:22.180 --> 43:28.900]  men going to war. When I was drafted, I was 24, 25. What Alex was telling you, these young
[43:28.900 --> 43:34.660]  kids have mandatory two-year service in the Republic of Korea Army, which is a very effective
[43:34.660 --> 43:40.900]  army. In the old days, we had to hold back PLO, PLO men, petroleum, lubricant, and oil
[43:40.900 --> 43:45.380]  because the South Korean Army was very effective, and if we didn't hold them back, they were
[43:45.380 --> 43:52.780]  attacked across the DMZ. So, you have to imagine Korea being split in half with a line of control
[43:52.780 --> 43:58.220]  where on the one side, the North Koreans have 2.2 million military soldiers with antiquated
[43:58.220 --> 44:03.420]  equipment and old generals who come out of the communist regime who were trained by Kim
[44:03.420 --> 44:09.420]  Il-sung. Now, Kim Il-sung was the father of North Korea. The reason they say he's crazy
[44:09.420 --> 44:15.380]  or inappropriate is for wrong. Kim Il-sung was a very famous fighter against the Japanese
[44:15.380 --> 44:22.260]  occupation, and to understand the history of Korea, you have to understand that Korea
[44:22.260 --> 44:30.420]  was slaughtered by Japanese rule over a 35-year period, starting from 1915 to 1945, where
[44:30.420 --> 44:35.980]  the Japanese still do not want to apologize to Korea, and where they used the women of
[44:35.980 --> 44:42.180]  Korea, raped them, pillaged them, came and brought them to Japan to serve as service
[44:42.180 --> 44:47.420]  women. Japan will not apologize for this, and very few Koreans in South Korea will ever
[44:47.420 --> 44:52.660]  forget what Japan has done, despite the fact that Japan is now doing business.
[44:52.660 --> 44:56.700]  They created hundreds of thousands of the ghost children. So, you've given us background.
[44:56.700 --> 45:02.260]  I know you are a leading Korea Peninsula expert. You were telling me off air this is a giant
[45:02.260 --> 45:07.420]  shy-op, multi-faceted. Who's behind it? What's the master plan, Dr. Pechenik?
[45:07.420 --> 45:14.580]  Here's the major shy-ops. The major shy-ops is we have had our army involved in several
[45:14.580 --> 45:21.660]  basically failed wars. We had them invaded into Iraq. As you know, from Bush, we had
[45:21.660 --> 45:27.580]  the invasion of Afghanistan, thanks to Obama, and we've had incursions into various Middle
[45:27.580 --> 45:34.260]  East countries. All have failed. We also have to remember that the U.S. Army failed in the
[45:34.260 --> 45:38.660]  war in Korea, and that the only general who brought it forth and made peace on the DMZ
[45:38.660 --> 45:43.940]  was General Eisenhower, so it took a military man to bring peace. What really happened now
[45:43.940 --> 45:50.100]  was I anticipated that because the Navy was not involved in any of the prior incursions
[45:50.100 --> 45:58.420]  in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and only served as a deterrent in the Mediterranean and basically
[45:58.420 --> 46:05.140]  the oil companies, denying any access to so-called terrorists, which really weren't there, they
[46:05.140 --> 46:12.420]  immediately switched to Asia as we began to get involved with Asian denial of access in
[46:12.420 --> 46:18.020]  the Straits of Malacca and instigated the Japanese militaristic empire, and at the same
[46:18.020 --> 46:26.180]  time we were forcing the Chinese in our confrontation to force the North Koreans. So it's a kind
[46:26.180 --> 46:32.980]  of kabuki of concentrated efforts on the part of the United States, North Korea, South Korea,
[46:32.980 --> 46:38.860]  and China, which I have seen for over 35 years. What happens usually is that the leader of
[46:38.860 --> 46:46.660]  North Korea had the instigation of China because of our relationships that become poor as our
[46:46.660 --> 46:52.300]  relationship with China becomes poor. China starts to act out and then informs North Korea
[46:52.300 --> 47:00.500]  to do something that seems silly or very dangerous or self-destructive. In the meantime, we know
[47:00.500 --> 47:06.620]  very well everything about Kim Jong-un, the new leader. He's been in Switzerland for
[47:06.620 --> 47:13.540]  15 years. He was a very poor student, extremely shy, very loved basketball, but is in fact
[47:13.540 --> 47:19.100]  was never trained to either be a leader of the Communist Party or, as they call him,
[47:19.100 --> 47:28.020]  the commissioner or the master planner and master soldier of the DPRK or the Korean army.
[47:28.020 --> 47:34.380]  So I knew that basically we had a phantom army, we had a paper tiger in the US, and
[47:34.380 --> 47:40.020]  we had basically a very strong China, which where we all played and agreed that as our
[47:40.020 --> 47:46.100]  navy went to the Asian course, we basically would start creating another strategic tension
[47:46.100 --> 47:52.060]  as we had done with terrorism in 9-11, as we had done with Afghanistan, the Haqqani
[47:52.060 --> 47:58.760]  group in Afghanistan, as we had done the civil war in Pakistan, and as we're now supporting
[47:58.760 --> 48:05.740]  the Salafists in Syria. All of this is done in order to fulfill the mandates of our soldiers
[48:05.740 --> 48:11.460]  who have not been in duty and in action and need to have the action and test out their
[48:11.460 --> 48:16.860]  battle plans. In effect, our military has been very ineffective. There is no way, as
[48:16.860 --> 48:22.500]  I see it on the DMZ and having worked with previous generals all the way in Seoul, that
[48:22.500 --> 48:28.060]  you people have to understand that Seoul is only 30 miles away from the DMZ. The DMZ is
[48:28.060 --> 48:35.500]  literally the demarcation where 2.2 million North Korean soldiers can invade in 30 miles
[48:35.500 --> 48:40.300]  and there is no army in the world, including the US army, and they know that very, very
[48:40.300 --> 48:46.000]  well. I've repeatedly went over this with several generals over 30 years and I informed
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.460]  them that we are nothing more than what we call a trip wire. In other words, US soldiers
[48:51.460 --> 48:57.780]  being placed here was an unnecessary expense on the behalf of the US public and the American
[48:57.780 --> 49:04.180]  presidents as a requirement for a trip wire. That meant as soon as the North Koreans would
[49:04.180 --> 49:10.380]  attack in Seoul, which they never would do, and every South Korean knew that, then there
[49:10.380 --> 49:15.700]  would be total conflagration. Well, that never happened in 30 years. I knew Kim Il Sung,
[49:15.700 --> 49:19.260]  I knew how ruthless he was, but he was very smart and he knew my control.
[49:19.260 --> 49:23.740]  Am I correct in saying this is the greatest saber-rattling escalation and why would the
[49:23.740 --> 49:29.820]  Chinese play along with the West? I mean, I know at the high levels, I mean, there are
[49:29.820 --> 49:35.140]  globalists manipulating both sides, but what's the larger game? Why is China playing along?
[49:35.140 --> 49:40.140]  I mean, we know the shift a few years ago was the ships in the Pacific. The Middle East
[49:40.140 --> 49:45.340]  has been given to Al-Qaeda. There's to be a domestic crackdown on real Americans here.
[49:45.340 --> 49:51.680]  That's the new war and then have real confrontations with the Chinese while the globalists have
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.140]  invested everything in China. Well, let's take away the world globalist,
[49:56.140 --> 50:01.620]  what we do have here, and let me use another word, Alex, not to contradict you, but basically
[50:01.620 --> 50:07.660]  what we have in South Korea, unlike North Korea and even China. South Korea is the fastest
[50:07.660 --> 50:13.980]  growing country in Asia. It is the highest productivity with the lowest number of unemployment
[50:13.980 --> 50:19.540]  and they have been producing products from Samsung to Hyundai and selling all over the
[50:19.540 --> 50:20.940]  world. Yeah, it's the new Japan. It's the new Japan,
[50:20.940 --> 50:24.180]  the most connected. It's beyond the new Japan. It is so strong
[50:24.180 --> 50:30.420]  and can out-compete Japan. Now let's get to China. The reason we have this confrontation
[50:30.420 --> 50:35.700]  with China, which we facilitated and we deal directly with China, is the fact that we have
[50:35.700 --> 50:42.380]  a new leader in China named Xi Pong. Xi Pong is a technocrat and much like Kim Jong-un,
[50:42.380 --> 50:50.020]  the new leader of North Korea, he is a spoiled, coddled princeling. In other words, in China
[50:50.020 --> 50:55.380]  you have to remember there was always a one son policy and he's the, so he's like the
[50:55.380 --> 51:00.860]  baby boomer of the vicious demonic chai koms. We'll be back with Dr. Maciejnic.
[51:00.860 --> 51:06.320]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[51:06.320 --> 51:11.580]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[51:11.580 --> 51:15.860]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[51:15.860 --> 51:20.820]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.

[54:15.140 --> 54:19.860]  By the way, he's going to be on the DMZ Sunday. That'll be Monday morning on the Sunday show,
[54:19.860 --> 54:25.180]  4 to 6 p.m. We're going to get Dr. Pachinik on, let's say in the second hour, so that
[54:25.180 --> 54:30.100]  can be 7 a.m., so you can actually get some sleep. So 6, 7 a.m., that'll be Sunday, 4
[54:30.100 --> 54:35.280]  to 6 central. He's there. And again, folks, this is what he's done. This is the desk he
[54:35.280 --> 54:41.220]  was over for a while. He's talked a lot about this. It's well known in the news media that
[54:41.220 --> 54:44.620]  that's what he did. And he was telling me off air some interesting things. What is the
[54:44.620 --> 54:50.260]  big picture here, Dr. Steve Pachinik? You're there with this crisis. How real is the crisis?
[54:50.260 --> 54:55.300]  What does this signify? You were getting into the new Communist Party head there in China.
[54:55.300 --> 54:59.340]  You agree with me during the break that he is a giant, spoiled communist baby boomer.
[54:59.340 --> 55:05.420]  What this really signifies is our American inability. Over 30 years, South Korea has
[55:05.420 --> 55:10.780]  grown because of people like myself and others like Don Gregg, Jim Lindley, who worked here
[55:10.780 --> 55:16.260]  and really transformed this country from a military dictatorship to a civilian one. What
[55:16.260 --> 55:22.660]  it also emphasizes is how poor and desperate North Korea is, because we will not absorb,
[55:22.660 --> 55:28.460]  we the United States and China, will not absorb North Korea and a unification process into
[55:28.460 --> 55:35.020]  South Korea. And the reason for that is that South Korean poverty and anti-communism, I've
[55:35.020 --> 55:40.220]  had experience with 30 years ago when I took down the Soviet Union. I took down East Germany
[55:40.220 --> 55:45.700]  and West Germany. And everybody knows in the U.S. government that if we were to take down
[55:45.700 --> 55:50.940]  North Korea quickly, the North Korean government, which we are able to do by just not providing
[55:50.940 --> 55:56.740]  food and forcing the Chinese to break open their borders, we would have a major economic
[55:56.740 --> 56:03.420]  crisis. So what this is, is a controlled agitation propaganda in order to maintain a soft landing.
[56:03.420 --> 56:08.060]  Now let me explain this to our American people. The reason we work with the Chinese and the
[56:08.060 --> 56:12.700]  reason we work with the North Korean, because the American public doesn't realize we're
[56:12.700 --> 56:18.300]  supplying food in order to keep the people in North Korea at a subsistence level. What's
[56:18.300 --> 56:25.100]  not possible and what's happening here is the frenzy of the American media and once
[56:25.100 --> 56:31.260]  again Obama and his inept White House and the ability of secretaries they carry to keep
[56:31.260 --> 56:36.460]  his mouth shut. They have violated every principle of international crisis management, which
[56:36.460 --> 56:41.580]  I developed, which others have worked with like Charles Hill and other administrations
[56:41.580 --> 56:48.660]  and who know that in order to keep a crisis like this from going from escalating by accident,
[56:48.660 --> 56:54.320]  we keep the media away. We don't discuss military equipment. We don't get into the frenzy and
[56:54.320 --> 57:00.180]  warmongering of explaining what kind of missile systems the North Korean have, how they can
[57:00.180 --> 57:05.840]  shoot the missiles into the sky and get into the western part of California. It is not
[57:05.840 --> 57:11.780]  possible. The North Koreans have absolutely no capacity to develop a missile. They can't
[57:11.780 --> 57:17.060]  even make an automobile. They can't even. They dropped 57 Chevys around. They're a total
[57:17.060 --> 57:23.220]  joke. It's a total joke. They have a 2.2 military army and when I saw the equipment, it hasn't
[57:23.220 --> 57:28.220]  changed. Even now as I analyze the equipment with my guide on the DMZ and I can see these
[57:28.220 --> 57:34.060]  soldiers on this other side with binoculars. We have 2.2 million soldiers who are really
[57:34.060 --> 57:39.380]  hungry. They're starving. They don't believe anymore in North Korea, but what South Korea
[57:39.380 --> 57:45.260]  had done very brilliantly over the years with our encouragement was to create under Hyundai
[57:45.260 --> 57:46.260]  and Samsung.
[57:46.260 --> 57:49.900]  Sure, sure. They've used the threat to control their people. Let me throw this at you. Isn't
[57:49.900 --> 57:54.760]  the real danger when the wall comes down and that if there's not a transition because the
[57:54.760 --> 57:56.580]  west wants to keep this going?
[57:56.580 --> 58:02.180]  As always, Alex, you hit it right on the head and we made that mistake. I made that mistake
[58:02.180 --> 58:08.420]  along with Baker and Zoellick in the transformation in East Germany, what we did not realize at
[58:08.420 --> 58:14.300]  the time when we brought in communist Germany, which was even more economically advanced
[58:14.300 --> 58:21.220]  than North Korea. We had completely flooded the capability of the West Germans to handle
[58:21.220 --> 58:28.900]  50,000 East Germans who didn't have work, didn't have jobs, weren't trained, weren't
[58:28.900 --> 58:34.660]  trained, and basically lived at a subsistence level. It cost Germany and the United States
[58:34.660 --> 58:35.660]  a fortune.
[58:35.660 --> 58:43.300]  Sure, so let's come back in one minute and talk about what's going to happen.
[58:43.300 --> 58:51.060]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.060 --> 58:55.780]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[58:55.780 --> 59:00.540]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[59:00.540 --> 59:05.980]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[59:54.060 --> 01:00:08.820]  war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:17.500]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:25.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. It has been said by many a historian that
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.980]  war is the health of the state. Our authoritarian state, the Chinese authoritarian state, the
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:35.060]  North Korean authoritarian state, the South Korean state, they all stand to gain on the
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:42.020]  surface from crises, diversions. But with a collapsing hermit kingdom of Stalinist scum,
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.460]  oppressing and sitting on top of the little skeletons that they've almost sucked dry,
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.280]  could this all be jockeying for some new deal, for a new level of aid?
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.880]  Because China doesn't wanna do it. Why not let the North fall, implode into China, really
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.780]  cause them some problems? No, the globalists don't want that. They wanna use Mexico to
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.900]  implode into us instead. But could this get out of control? And I think what Pacinek said
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:10.980]  to me off air is, they've got a bunch of rubes and boobs, a bunch of pirates, boobies, over
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.980]  there who don't know what they're doing.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.900]  In four minutes, Doc, you're back with us Sunday in the second hour, you'll have more.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.540]  You're on the DMZ, if stuff breaks, you wanna stay up, we could do a nightly news tonight.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.220]  I'd love to love you to email us some photos of what you're seeing, that'd be powerful.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.700]  I'm sure you got a snapshot digital phone. What's the big danger then? Could this be
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.420]  the North preparing to collapse?
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:34.420]  Well, this is partly the North preparing to collapse, but I don't believe that's the real
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:40.020]  danger. The real danger is China is in very serious trouble because China cannot control
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:45.300]  its internal security. So in turn, China and its relationship with the United States and
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:50.540]  the fact that the United States think that correctly is supporting Japan and in the war
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:57.700]  between the United States, Japan and China, China's only recourse is to instigate a very
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:04.620]  inappropriate agitation of North Korea, claiming that they can send missiles and all. Our best
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:10.060]  recourse now is for a secretary of state and a president to cool everybody down, to shut
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:17.140]  down and warn CNN and all the media that if they don't stop, cease and desist, to create
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.860]  education propaganda, which is the first principle of international crisis management. And then
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:27.820]  they tell their own military generals to stop talking about missiles and construction of
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:33.460]  missiles. And they have the capability to do this and try and handle it in a quiet,
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:40.540]  discreet military fashion. I have no problem if two Aegean missile system destroyers are
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:45.820]  coming in here. The South Koreans have agreed with me. They have no problem with two stealth
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:52.340]  bombers coming in or two stealth fighter fighters, but it has to be kept quiet. The success of
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:59.300]  international crisis management in an inappropriate society like Kim Jong-un, whose brain I know
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.940]  very well and contrary to the media, where they hype it up and said only a psychiatrist
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:08.260]  would really understand him. Well, here I am, the psychiatrist who really understands
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.580]  and then has 30 years of experience, but our government, our media, our intelligence didn't
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:19.040]  want to hear anything I had to say. So I go to the only outlet and the only man and friend
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.060]  that I've had for 20 years who's allowed the truth to come out. And that is for us to tone
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:30.260]  down our rhetoric, stop the education propaganda, stop announcing what we're doing. We can quietly
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:36.140]  support Ms. Park, who's handling this situation extremely well. And I have to say the South
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:42.020]  Korean people, all 30 million of them, very young, a low below the age of 40, are making
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:47.260]  fun of us and saying yes. Actually, in the night before I was on a DMZ zone, I had what
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:53.140]  we call the last supper where everybody joked. We ate eel, we drank some kampai, and we said,
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.340]  okay, gentlemen, this is our last supper, when in fact we knew there was nothing that
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:03.100]  was to be dangerous. Soul is moving, it's active, it's clean, it's appropriate. The
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.340]  people are kind, the children are kind. No one is panicked, but they find it disgusting
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:14.140]  that the United States government is creating again more crisis, more education in order
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:20.820]  to serve the U.S. purpose, the Chinese purpose, and to create another potential war. The danger
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:26.820]  of all of this is because our president is so inept, as we've seen in Pakistan, Iraq,
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:32.700]  and Syria, and because the White House is an old, antiquated bunch of people who have
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.060]  no experience whatsoever.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.460]  All right, we'll stop there. I want to come back. I've got another guest coming up, Chuck
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:42.880]  Baldwin. But Dr. Pachinik, you are a psychiatrist, a Harvard psychiatrist, and you help work
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.500]  the Camp David Accords. I mean, you're famous for this, hostage negotiation, you name it.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.780]  I want you to come back and tell us the danger of hyping this and getting it out of control.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:57.460]  And I want you to briefly give us an analysis of Kim Jong-un, the Chinese leader as well,
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.660]  and the South Korean leader, and Obama.

[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:24.560]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.740]  Each documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:33.620]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:39.940]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners,
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:45.300]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:50.460]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's

[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:09.420]  supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.060]  alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.980]  may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:23.500]  fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.900]  be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.460]  cost and availability of your food supply with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you

[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:27.460]  Alex Jones. Alright, again, thank you for joining us here in the second hour of this
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:35.220]  Friday edition, the fifth day of April 2013. I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:42.480]  with the Sunday show. Many of our AM and FM affiliates that carry the weekday show also
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.920]  carry the Sunday show, but you really should call XM and get them to pick up the Sunday
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:52.000]  show as well. That's how we get on more AM and FM affiliates as well. If you're listening
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.740]  on the internet or on satellite in your area and there's not a local AM or FM, call the
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:01.500]  local talk station, tell them, pick up the broadcast. That's how we've gone. Over 150
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.540]  affiliates, and we're with a small syndicator. The big three pretty much have a monopoly.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:12.860]  We have salmon swum upstream. And my point is, the White House responds to us, the globalists
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:17.940]  respond to us, the globalists respond to the Drudge Report. More and more, there's only
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.940]  a few outlets that are really able to get real news out. No one would know about the
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:27.260]  Copenhagen document that they plan to shut off the Third World energy supplies and our
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:33.020]  energy supply if Infowars.com hadn't written about it with Lord Monckton and then DrudgeReport.com
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.020]  hadn't picked it up.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:37.980]  I mean, there's just hundreds of things like that. No one know about the bullets, the domestic
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.900]  arms buildup, all of this. And listen to me, you've heard all the historians we've had
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:47.620]  on. You've heard all the military historians, all the sociologists, all the anthropologists.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:53.740]  I am a person, because I enjoy it from a young age, I'm a person that's read psychology,
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:10:00.060]  anthropology, sociology, history. And so it's not rocket science, though. What we see forming
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:06.580]  worldwide is a decadent cascade event with corrupt, leveraged, disconnected leaders because
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.060]  of decadent, disconnected populations.
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:14.060]  Not predominantly, but enough of it to aid them and a government and corporate class
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:20.260]  that have become degenerate. That's when world wars happen. And we've told you that as the
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:25.380]  world economy melts down, as there's currency wars, physical wars will begin. You notice
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.380]  they're now saying they're not gonna call Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda. They're not gonna call
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.660]  them Islamicist.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:34.180]  We're now told to call them good guys. That's Associated Press today. If you just join me,
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.220]  I'll go with the article. That's because the globalists are gonna use them as the new proxy
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:42.260]  army because they're the old proxy army. And we've got a guy on the line who was there
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.140]  with Jimmy Carter when all that started, and who knows Brzezinski.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:51.780]  And he's a psychiatrist and an MD. He is an American psychiatrist, former State Department
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.500]  official, author and publisher. He is currently acclaimed author in psychopolitical thrillers,
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.780]  and the co-creator of the best selling Tom Clancy op center. And Tom Clancy's Netforce
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.700]  paperback series, trained in psychiatry at Harvard University International Relations
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.180]  at MIT.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.860]  His novels are based on 20 years experience. And the truth is, he won't ever talk about
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:15.940]  it on air. But you can go look at overthrowing major governments. Get it credited to psych
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:21.500]  warfare. He won't talk about it. Maybe it's not true. The London Guardian says it is.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.620]  Tricking the communists to kill the Prime Minister who they'd already captured. I mean,
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.860]  things like that. Really interesting guy who only really pops up on this show because other
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.660]  places would censor him or control what he talks about.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:38.660]  We had him on in the last hour. We've only got about nine minutes left here. But he was
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.540]  the head of the desk over that area of Asia for a period of time. He helped get rid, I
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:49.620]  remember this on record, of the military dictatorship that was in South Korea for so long and a
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:54.460]  transition. He's there on his own with a guide given to him by the government up on the DMZ
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.460]  right now.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:00.140]  I want you briefly to go over the mindset of Kim Jong-un, the mindset of the new Chinese
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.620]  communist leader. Why Obama and the media are hyping this and why you're saying there's
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:09.820]  a danger in the hyping where they're saying nuclear war could happen any minute. The North
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:13.780]  is saying they're going to nuke the US. What is behind all this? Dr. Steve Pechenig.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:19.500]  Let me get into the mindset of Kim Jong-un. I know his mindset extremely well. He grew
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.900]  up in Lake Geneva in Switzerland. He went to the Swiss boarding school. By chance, it
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.140]  happens that I went to Swiss boarding school when I was kicked out. He was not. He was
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:35.460]  a very poor student. He was very shy. He was very inept and really only enjoyed basketball.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:41.780]  The reality is what you have is the classical communist scenario and paradox with the entire
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:48.200]  Kim Jong-un family and the entire Kim Jong-il family have for the 15 years lived in Lake
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:54.180]  Geneva in prosperity and even Kim Jong-un said to his own father, how is it that I can
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:00.020]  live a life of luxury, horseback riding, shooting, skeeting, and playing basketball while white
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.180]  people are starving? His father just said, don't worry. We will have the money and we'll
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:11.660]  always maintain our power structure. The real issue now is can the Korean military control
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:17.180]  Korea? The answer is not clear because they take directions exactly from the communist
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:22.740]  China. In communist China, Xi Peng, who I have followed for over 20 years, is the son
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:28.620]  of the famous revolutionary of the communist party who was indicted in the cultural revolution
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:33.500]  and was so-called reformed, but was brought up through the system because of his alliances
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:39.180]  with the military and the crony capitalism and the corruption of China. China has been
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:43.900]  having problems with the United States and our force structure in Eastern Asia and the
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:48.780]  fact that we have moved all of our battleships and our marine course to Eastern Asia to deny
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:54.100]  access to the Chinese correctly, to their trading companies, and all to the fact that
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:59.700]  they are collapsing internally. So two countries are collapsing internally. China, because
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:04.780]  it cannot maintain social stability, it does not have water, it has to get water from the
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:10.340]  Tibetan high marks, and the fact that its social economy is totally a false economy
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:16.840]  and a runaway economy that's been funded by JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and all the hedge
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:25.380]  funds including our former Secretary of Treasury Paul Peterson, who knew nothing about banking
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.380]  at one end too, but has always been a crony capitalist of the Chinese. So what you have
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:36.820]  is two very similar princelings who are not qualified to run their government in terms
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:43.140]  of the Chinese leader. He's a technocrat, never had diplomatic experience, lived in
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:48.300]  the United States, really does not understand how to maintain social stability, like Deng
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:54.340]  Chaoping, Jiang Zemin, Zhou Inlai, Lu Caoqi, and all the regional revolutionists. He's
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:59.180]  spoiled, he's corrupt, and he has all their families are corrupt. And the same way we
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:05.500]  have this corruption and the spoiled Kim Jong-un who grew up in Switzerland, you can't think
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:10.700]  of him as a North Korean. You have to think of him as the preppy Swiss boarding school
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:16.460]  boy who's shy, inept, has never been in the military, has been forced by his own military
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:23.020]  to be the face of Korea because his father felt that his oldest son, Kim Jong-un, was
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.180]  too feminine, so he needed a stronger face. So what we have is a paper doll, China and
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:35.220]  a paper doll, North Korea, all creating an episode because the United States military
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:41.020]  has come in and said, we're going to protect our national security interests, our economic
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:47.180]  interests, all the way from Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, and Japan. The reason for that
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:53.340]  is China has engaged in what we call a low-intensity conflict in the Spratly Islands, which I wrote
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:16:01.000]  about 20 years ago in Pacifica, longer handle the internal economy. So when they can no
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.540]  longer handle the internal economy, they push the Koreans in order to make the kind of noise
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:13.980]  in what we call in psychiatry acting out behavior or baby-like behavior. I call Kim Jong-un the
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:19.420]  baby in the crib who screams and yells, looks at missiles that really can't fly anywhere,
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.540]  has no capacity. There's one of the few guys in America who understands this, Charles
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:28.460]  Hill, who worked in North Korea, and really what they're doing is we're fostering
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:35.760]  that type of reaction so that we can demonstrate how strong our Navy is, how strong our capability
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.500]  to control the situation. But in fact, what's happening is we're showing the opposite
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.680]  in the South Korean people and the South Korean army, and intelligence is seeing exactly what
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.540]  I'm seeing on the DMZ zone. We become a joke. We send over two stealth fighter planes
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:57.680]  at 22, which has absolutely no relevance because the North Koreans can never attack South Korea,
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.860]  otherwise they will be destroyed, 22 million people, and South Seoul is only 30 miles away.
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:10.500]  I'm right on the top of that nuclear storm, right on the DMZ, as I'm talking to young
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.540]  Korean soldiers who, quite frankly, are not prepared to go to war and know under the hearts
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:20.620]  of hearts that they will not confront the North Koreans coming over. But once that Kim
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:27.780]  Jong-un underneath the Chinese provocation and American ineptness in handling this control
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:33.440]  will create a situation where it will be out of control. In the case of his grandfather,
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:41.820]  they blew up the South Korean presidential platform. In the case of his father, they
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:47.300]  also blew up ships. So what happens in a certain crisis can get blown out very quickly, number
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.940]  one, because we don't have a president who really is qualified to run-
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:56.020]  Well, that was my final point, is that you've got special crony capitalist interests that
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:00.620]  want to work with authoritarian regimes, as Carol Quigley wrote at Georgetown. They want
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:05.060]  weak people reading off teleprompters, so now there's no leadership anywhere. It's like
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:10.660]  an absurdist science fiction Kurt Vonnegut novel where some kid from Switzerland is commanding
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:15.780]  a bunch of psychopaths, vampires. You've got China on the edge of collapse. You've got
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:21.300]  insanity here. You've got crony interests shutting down all their competition. I mean,
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:27.540]  it looks like a civilization collapse type event down the road with this type of lunacy.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.240]  And then building up North Korea to the South Koreans looks completely insane because they
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.420]  know what jokes they are. I mean, this is Alice in Wonderland.
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:42.060]  That's correct. It's more than Alice in Wonderland. It's Alice in Wonderland on steroids and LSD.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:48.500]  It's a total non-reality because in talking to all the South Korean students, workers,
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:53.340]  and military, they can't take this seriously. So what we considered the day of the war that
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:59.460]  Kim Jong Il declared the end of the world yesterday, I went out with some of my South
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:04.980]  Korean military friends and intelligence operators, and we had our last separate consisting of
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:12.100]  veal, diet coke, and rice. And we all laughed, showing how incompetent the leader of Kim
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.260]  Jong Il was, the leader of China, and also POTUS.
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:18.860]  I guess it will be your last meal with diet coke with the aspartame.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:25.860]  We were sending over two stealth bombers, which cost us close to 500 million to a billion.
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:31.380]  They laughed when they said we sent two Aegean missile ships, which can do absolutely nothing.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:36.580]  So our posturing is like a paper tiger, which China was like, and we can do nothing in the
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.580]  entire situation.
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.580]  All right, well, Doc, Doc, Doc.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:45.340]  And the South Koreans have complained to me as we have created agitation propaganda in
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.340]  the news media.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:50.420]  All right, Doc, we got to go to break. I got to come back with one more segment with you
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:54.060]  because I got to find out, what do you expect to see come out of this? What is the danger
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.900]  then if it's all just posturing?
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:01.340]  Final segment from the DMZ with Dr. Steve Puchenik.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.740]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:08.700]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.780]  arsenal for home protection.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:14.660]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.980]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:38.220]  counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.220]  to service debt.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.740]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:46.020]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:49.700]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.700]  system.

[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.500]  That bears repeating.

[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.780]  Pro-EM-1, the raw probiotic.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:18.540]  All right, final segment with Dr. Steve Pochinik, he'll be back Sunday with us in the second
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.860]  hour of the Sunday broadcast.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:26.060]  I've got Mr. O'Keefe of the Veritas Project coming on, who went to the Hollywood Hills
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:33.940]  home of Piers Morgan, who has a armed response signs up saying he has armed guards.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:38.580]  The hypocrisy of the so-called ruling class wanting us, their quarry, disarmed.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:41.420]  Dr. Pochinik, sum it all up for people.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:47.740]  You told me during the break what the real danger is that Korea will implode, North Korea
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:52.660]  will implode North and South into China and into South Korea and trigger World War III.
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:58.180]  In your own words, repeat that and talk about what the establishment is doing and why you
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.180]  think it's so dangerous.
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:06.380]  What's going to happen now is because of this predictable, everyone in the media says that
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.180]  these North Koreans are crazy and unpredictable.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.180]  The answer is no.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:15.100]  They have been extremely predictable, including Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jong-Il, and Kim Jong-Un,
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:16.100]  the little princely.
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.900]  We know exactly their behavior better.
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.780]  We know exactly how they work.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:23.180]  We know that every time they act out, we can control it.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.380]  But in order to control it, we need a very effective President of the United States,
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:31.740]  an effective Secretary of State, which Kerry is not, an effective intelligence community,
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.380]  which we do not have, and a military that's not gung ho and understands the limits of
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:37.380]  the capability.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.700]  The limits of the capability is that very simply that if North Korea attacks South Korea,
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:48.440]  which is not likely through Seoul because we're only 30 miles away, if they act out
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.820]  in any way that we cannot manage because of the hype that we have created through CNN,
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:59.340]  Wolf Blitzer, Zechariah, and Ammanipur, and other generals in the U.S. Army who should
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:07.020]  be shut down and indicted for creating education propaganda, we could have literally an implosion
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:14.100]  of North Korean poverty, scurrying over into South Korea, and then have a major collapse
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:19.540]  of both North Korea and South Korea, but more importantly of China, because the North Koreans
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:23.100]  are so poor that they're screaming over the border of China.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:28.420]  So we have an incompetent Xi Pong, who's a technocrat, a princeling, and a spoiled
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:35.860]  Chinese technocrat, very much like Kim Jong-In, who's a spoiled Switzerland-trained leader
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:41.620]  who has been hoarded by every intelligence community in the world, including the French,
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:47.500]  the Swiss, the Americans, the Germans, the Russians, you name them, because in 15 years,
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.300]  if you're in a Swiss boarding school, and you're playing basketball, and you're
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:55.580]  not very smart, and you're quite a famine, and you don't know how to deal with women,
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.340]  you certainly don't know how to manage a country.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:03.740]  So we're coming into, very quickly, thanks to our American media and the frenzy of American
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:08.540]  media, the frenzy of the military, particularly the Navy, to say that we're bringing in
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:16.180]  the GNCs, that we will send in stealth bombers, does not do anything to control or quiet the
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:21.980]  temper of a crisis, which is the principles of crisis management that I created 30 years
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.900]  ago, and very sagacious people like Don Gregg, Jim Lilly, and others who had worked in the
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:33.980]  CIA, and our ambassadors here understood that you keep the agitation and the warmongering
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.220]  to the lowest flame.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:40.100]  What we're doing now is increasing the flames, thanks to CNN, thanks to our military and
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.660]  our Navy, thanks to the ignorance of the White House, the ineptness of our president, the
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.900]  ineptness of the Chinese, and the ineptness of the North Korea.
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:54.620]  We could literally land in World War III with not only nuclear proliferation, but there
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:28:00.300]  is gas warfare, and the ability that we would never thought possible of the North Koreans
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:05.460]  to come into South Korea, because Seoul, where I am located, I'm only 10 kilometers away
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:09.060]  from North Korea, and I can see the North Koreans right now.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:15.100]  I see Kim Il-sung's stations, I see the mobilization of their troops, but at the same time, the
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:21.420]  young troops in South Korea are not qualified to fight into an army that has only three
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:28.100]  days of petroleum, lubricant, and oil, so what we have here is an impending crisis that's
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.100]  totally mismanaged.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:34.980]  Well, isn't that 101, that you don't build up the enemy as super dangerous and powerful?
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:40.220]  They should be laughing at Kim Jong-un, calling him pathetic and weak, and he can't even get
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.220]  a-
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.220]  That's what's happening in South Korea.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.220]  Excuse me, Alex.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.220]  Everybody here is laughing.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:48.580]  We're talking about it, and we're saying how absurd North Korea is.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:54.300]  We have absolutely no regard for G-Pong, and we find him very inept, as the Chinese students
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:58.380]  should start rioting in China to say this is not the leader of China.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:03.340]  But more importantly, we find it very disgraceful what America is doing by announcing they're
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:08.740]  sending two stealth bombers, one Chinese, one South Korean official said to me, how
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:14.260]  stupid can you Americans be to send billions of dollars worth of two planes that will do
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:19.780]  absolutely nothing, Asian missile systems that will do nothing because it cannot protect
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:26.380]  from a nuclear war, and all it is is a posture of a tiger will become where we're creating
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:31.180]  a situation where we show our weakness, we show our incompetence, we show our lack of
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:36.900]  capability to handle this situation, which has literally landed into World War III, but
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.700]  we know everything about Kim Jong-un.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.340]  All right, we're going to get an update, Doc, we've got to get a break, we're going to come
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:45.020]  back with our next guest, we're going to get an update, a very serious situation Sunday.

[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:35.020]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer,
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.980]  storage unit or shed.
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.400]  www.getsimplysafe.com.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:44.180]  Simply Safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes, so there's no
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.580]  need to let a stranger into your home.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:50.660]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:54.620]  You aren't always at home, but Simply Safe will stand guard, protecting your property
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.540]  24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:59.540]  Again, that's www.getsimplysafe.com.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:14.700]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:26.620]  You have found it, the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:31.540]  It doesn't even mean I do that good of a job, but I do the best I can and God knows that.
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:32.540]  I love liberty.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.540]  I love justice.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.420]  I get hurt by tyranny, and I'm going to tell a story about that here in a moment and go
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.420]  to Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:43.020]  He's going to be riding shotgun with us into the next hour with Dr. Greg Dixon to talk
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:48.300]  about the takeover of the church in this country and how they're openly going along with the
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.280]  persecution of veterans, gun owners, all of it.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.380]  My only gift, I think, is to recognize things hidden in plain view.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:34:00.100]  Like if I walked into my living room and there was a 1,000 pound elephant sitting there,
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.500]  a 10,000 pound elephant, I would recognize it as an elephant.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.980]  If Barbara Walters told me it wasn't an elephant, I would tell her she was a liar.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:11.900]  Now that's called being a conspiracy theorist, but we're going to be talking to Chuck Baldwin,
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:16.900]  Pastor Baldwin, former Constitution Party presidential candidate, of course, and someone
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:21.220]  demonized as very evil along with Ron Paul and myself by Homeland Security.
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.900]  But first off, this whole North Korea thing will probably blow over.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:31.260]  But it shows how it's the greatest rhetoric since that war ended more than 50 years ago.
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:34.880]  And you notice they're putting al-Qaeda in in the Middle East, and the AP says, don't
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.460]  call them al-Qaeda, don't even call them Islamicists, they're good guys.
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:42.340]  The CFR says, quote, we need al-Qaeda, the new enemy is the American people.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:50.540]  I mean, this is Earth shaking off the charts, congressional investigation, freaking out,
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.420]  my gosh, they wanna use Homeland Security as a coup d'etat against America.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.660]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:01.500]  Instead it's like, yeah, now we fight returning veterans, take all their guns and take their
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:02.500]  kids.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:09.100]  I mean, this is Civil War stuff, but despite all that, we need to just pray, move forward,
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.020]  speak out, and resist.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:14.980]  Because you wouldn't have the White House demonizing alternative media, attacking Drudge,
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:20.340]  saying they're causing us problems when we're on Drudge every week, attacking us as well.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.340]  If we didn't have power.
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:25.780]  And when I say, hey, there's not many of us actually fighting, that's saying, hey, join
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:26.780]  us.
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.260]  Look, we're only few that are actually prominent, but we are hundreds of millions worldwide
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.600]  that know about liberty.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.980]  If we just speak out, the enemy can be defeated.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:40.780]  There are different forces in the world, it's not just evil.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.300]  And we just give the world over to evil.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:46.700]  The truth is, folks, I've confronted the New World Order over and over again.
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:50.660]  And because I don't have fear, I only have fear of them winning, I only have fear of
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:55.220]  my weakness and my failure and my dirty rags that are my best works.
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:59.820]  But my spirit, I mean, when I see Christians having their children taken for no reason,
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.440]  or I see people having their kids taken for not taking vaccines when there's no law, I
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.900]  sit there and go to bed early and I don't wanna call it depressed, they'll come take
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.900]  my guns.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:13.100]  I mean, I feel it, and people are like, that's wimpy, don't care about other people.
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:17.860]  It's because I am strong, ladies and gentlemen, that I burn with something beyond hatred or
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:21.980]  even love, total commitment against these people.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:30.800]  And just the anger that my flesh is so weak, it can't work 18 hours a day, every day.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.960]  And that I cannot express to you the things I've researched and I know, but I know you
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:36.200]  know in your heart what's happening.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:42.360]  And just the evil, the acceptance of abortion, and now forced inoculations, and now veterans
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.080]  having their kids taken for no reason.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.980]  It's not just your guns and they're saying, I've got Geithner articles where they already
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:50.980]  started taking government pension funds.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:54.420]  You fools that serve this, we're gonna go to Pastor Baldwin.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:37:01.900]  I wanna just remind you that while all this is happening, our bodies being strong is key
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.840]  and supporting info wars is key.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.600]  And we've assembled the very best vitamins, minerals, really miraculous stuff like Beyond

[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.940]  month of April.

[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.180]  It's not about that.
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:09.200]  It's about getting yourself healthy, your mind focused.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.800]  They feed us garbage for a reason.

[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.900]  Support everybody.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.220]  Liberty doesn't have a lobby, okay?
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.560]  We don't have one.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.140]  We don't have a real lobby.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:14.140]  Foreign banks do.
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.460]  They've taken us over.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.140]  We are the lobby for liberty.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:22.880]  All right, shifting gears now, I wanted to get Pastor Chuck Baldwin on last week when
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.020]  I saw this article.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:28.820]  Franklin Graham on the wrong side of the Bible in history, he's come out calling for a massive
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.420]  restriction of the second amendment.
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:35.080]  The official Catholic newspaper, we're gonna show that, has come out and said, quote, repeal
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.340]  the second amendment.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.580]  You've got every denomination I know of.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:45.320]  I can't go to a church, a Baptist church, a Pentecostal church, a Bible church without
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.820]  hearing government worship.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:50.180]  And I for one have had enough, okay?
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:52.660]  And he wrote the book Romans 13, the true meaning of submission.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.260]  We also sell that in infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.620]  Great book to give to your pastors.
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:00.580]  But they're under 501 C3 government funding.
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:03.020]  But now they're coming out after the guns.
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:04.340]  We've got to go after them.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:09.360]  And I wanted to ask Pastor Baldwin biblically, he doesn't really need an introduction here
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360]  on this broadcast.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:16.060]  He's a radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, of course, been a pastor many years in Florida.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:20.740]  Now he's out in the mountain area building a remnant community out there, staunch defender
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.180]  of the Bill of Rights Constitution, ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:28.660]  I wanted to ask him in this great time of evil, what do we do?
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.140]  What does he think we should do?
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.620]  Because there is a purge against constitutional rights, it's begun.
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.620]  And as every other authoritarian regime, it starts quietly.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:45.100]  A lot of times the arrest for petty made up stuff starts and no one even covers it and
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:50.380]  no one recognizes it until it just becomes overwhelming or the dictatorship collapses.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.220]  So Pastor Baldwin, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.020]  Hey, great to be with you, Alex.
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.020]  Thank you very much.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.900]  Well, you just heard that seven minute intro there while I was talking about all this.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:00.900]  Where do you wanna start first?
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:05.260]  I mean, it's like the dam broke, the hedge is being lifted, evil is flooding in, and
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.380]  the preachers are all bought off.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:14.240]  Yeah, unfortunately, the 501 C3 tax exempt status has made slaves out of most pastors
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.540]  and churches.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:20.980]  They fear the IRS, they fear the loss of their tax exempt status.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:25.220]  And so when they get into the pulpits, they are afraid to discuss anything that might
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:26.220]  be controversial.
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:30.900]  Plus, let's not forget this, there's a lot of people out there in the congregations that
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:33.420]  are very weak, very wishy washy.
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.580]  They do not wanna hear the hard issues.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:41.700]  A lot of pastors are deathly afraid of offending their own congregations and they're afraid
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:45.180]  of losing the tithes and offerings of people.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:49.380]  They're afraid of the controversy that may erupt inside the congregation.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:54.140]  That combination has completely neutered the pulpits of America.
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:42:01.200]  And you're right, the churches and the pastors of America are literally contributing to the
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.980]  decline of our liberties here in this country today.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:11.020]  It's now come out that the official communist Chinese government is advising Obama on gun
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.020]  policy.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:16.000]  If you just tuned in, folks, just the People's Daily repeatedly, it's been national news
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.380]  a few months ago.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:21.620]  They are now demanding every Hollywood film be put by them.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:25.900]  No form of communism or authoritarianism can even be shown.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:30.380]  Forget criticizing Communist China, nothing can be shown.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:33.240]  We're now not just run by the New World Order here.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:38.300]  The communist Chinese that own our debt are occupying us.
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:43.020]  And the reason I bring that up is, look at this, the preachers are afraid to say anything
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.020]  that offends.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:48.100]  So now they're banning Lego toys of Jabba the Hutt because some Muslims said it was
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.220]  supposed to be a Muslim just out of the clear blue sky.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:53.900]  Political correctness is political control.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.060]  The Soviet Union called it political correctness.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:00.700]  And so now the preachers are like, I don't wanna offend anyone.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:04.700]  That's then used as a weapon to where now they can't even teach marriage.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:08.660]  They won't even criticize abortion because it might offend someone.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:12.100]  Now they're taking the crosses out of churches all over America.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.660]  I know you know about that initiative.
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.460]  I mean, this is it.
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.700]  Do you agree the takeover is now happening?
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.220]  Oh, there's no question.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.200]  I think it's been happening, Alex.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.860]  Back years ago when I was running for president in 2008, I was going around the country and
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:33.460]  talking to pastors and I couldn't tell you how many of them would say, well, we believe
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:38.220]  in what you stand for and we know that you're speaking the truth and we know that we need
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:40.740]  change and blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:47.020]  After all, we're 501c3 and we can't get involved and so we'll just pray for you.
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:53.640]  So again, that 501c3 tax exempt status has been the tool that Lyndon Johnson first created
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.620]  back in the 1950s that he knew what would happen.
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:00.940]  He knew it would neuter and control the pastors and churches.
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.460]  That's exactly what it's done.
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:07.460]  And now when you get guys like Franklin Graham and Richard Land, who by the way is a member
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:13.900]  of the CFR, as you know, coming out saying that they support Barack Obama's gun control
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:17.580]  initiatives, especially the universal background check.
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:23.780]  It shows the power that the government has over many of these evangelical leaders.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:28.140]  By the way, Alex, that's why my son Tim and I have written a brand new book called To
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:32.580]  Keep or Not To Keep, Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.060]  It's a brand new book.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.700]  It's just about to be released from the printer.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:36.700]  I wanna carry it.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:39.580]  And I wanna carry it because we carry your book on Romans 13.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:40.580]  Absolutely.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.580]  Very exciting.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.900]  This is gonna be a blockbuster because we go into the New Testament, the Old Testament,
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:51.620]  the entire scripture, and we prove conclusively that nowhere does the Bible teach that Christians
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:55.420]  should surrender their guns to any would-be tyrant.
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:56.980]  We go into in depth.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.100]  It's a blockbuster book.
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.140]  There's nothing like it in print.
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:04.420]  And when Christians get a hold of this, and even non-Christians, they're going to realize
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:10.860]  that natural law, biblical law, revealed law is on the side of the Second Amendment.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:14.400]  And so this is gonna be a book that's really gonna help people understand the issue.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.940]  And somebody needs to send a copy to Franklin Graham, by the way.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.140]  We're gonna talk about that coming up here in a moment.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:23.940]  But I'm sure you're familiar with it, but I followed it.
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:28.200]  But I talk to vets every day who've had a leg blown off or something.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.860]  They get them to say they're depressed, and they take their child, even though their wife
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:33.620]  is fine.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.980]  They're not just taking veterans' guns now.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:39.020]  They're also taking their children.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:43.300]  And then you see cases where anti-government parents, engineers with no criminal record,
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.820]  Air Force veteran, they took their kids, yeah, from the government that had had them for
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:47.820]  a year.
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:52.580]  And then they demonize infoawars.com cuz he got a sticker at his house in Florida.
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:57.120]  And I mean, are they gonna come grab my kids and say I'm anti-government?
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.300]  It's like, well, there go your kids to a reeducation camp.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:04.380]  I mean, they're just hiding this pure authoritarianism in plain view.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:10.500]  And every TV show now demonizes Christians, demonizes pro-lifers, demonizes gun owners.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.140]  I mean, it's like The Running Man or something.
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:18.340]  You turn on any show, and they're demonizing patriots and saying we're terrorists.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.620]  I mean, this is Twilight Zone level.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.860]  Yeah, it is.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:26.700]  And what's amazing to me relative to the way you've started the discussion here with pastors
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:32.500]  is, do these pastors really think that by them sitting back and not speaking up and
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:35.720]  not taking a stand, that they're going to be spared?
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.180]  Do they really think that they're going to be overlooked?
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:45.540]  I think this is very comparable to the Nazi Germany period of history, when there were
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:50.080]  some 14,000 evangelical churches in Germany at the time.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.860]  And of the 14,000 evangelical churches in Nazi Germany, it was becoming Nazi Germany,
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:00.060]  only 800 resisted Adolf Hitler.
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:02.380]  That's about 5%.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:08.700]  Now think about it, Alex, if 25% had have resisted Hitler, if 50% had have resisted
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:12.380]  Hitler, the entire history of the world would have been changed.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:18.060]  But because the pastor said and did nothing, Hitler was allowed to seize control of the
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.900]  government and then the country and enact all these-
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:27.340]  And 20 million, they were like 75 million, Germany counting 2 million soldiers lost 20
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.100]  million people.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:34.500]  Talk about a judgment, talk about doing nothing, and it's the same story over and over.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:40.420]  And authoritarians every time come after Christians, that's the point, is that you're never gonna
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.380]  do enough for them.
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.840]  Exactly, exactly my point.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.520]  And that's what the preachers don't understand, they think that by remaining neutral and trying
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.220]  to maintain politically correct messages, etc., that they are somehow gonna be spared
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.220]  any of this.
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.220]  They're in denial, actually.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.420]  Well, it's also a cop-out, they go, we're trying to win souls.
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:00.740]  Yeah, we know the evil's taken over.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.740]  I went to a big church this weekend with Dave Mustaine when he was in town, pretty good
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.540]  sermon overall, I liked the preacher.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:10.460]  But I saw the assistant preacher and stuff looking at us like scared, like, my gosh,
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:12.700]  there's Alex Jones, man, that guy's trouble.
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:16.460]  And I didn't do anything or say anything, I just went and checked out that church cuz
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:17.720]  my wife likes it.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.480]  But my point is, is that I've friends and family that go to Baptist churches, they get
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.180]  letters going, don't even talk about politics at church dinners.
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:27.740]  I mean, this is the Soviet Union.
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:35.380]  And as you know, Thomas Jefferson didn't even say religion shouldn't be involved in things.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.540]  It said government cannot be involved in religion.
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:44.060]  As the First Amendment states, Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.540]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:50.280]  But they've taken separation of church and state and made a debate about does it exist
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.700]  or not, when it never even meant that.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:58.420]  It meant the government has no jurisdiction, but they trick people into 501c3.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:01.260]  They stop being a church and become a charity.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:05.180]  Yeah, that's exactly right, that's exactly right.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:09.480]  They're not a church, they are a government corporation.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:15.900]  The pastor is not a pastor, he is a corporate officer, same with the deacons, the elders.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.980]  They are viewed as corporate officers of the state.
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:24.700]  And I really believe, and this is kind of harsh for me to say, but I mean, I've been
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:29.140]  in the heart of this battle for so long and I really believe I'm about to tell you, Alex.
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:37.500]  I really believe that at the heart of the problem, our pastors and churches today are
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.400]  state worshippers.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:40.400]  They are.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.460]  I really believe that.
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:46.200]  They do not worship the king of the universe, the king of kings and Lord of lords.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.540]  They pretend that they do, they sing songs, they have praise services.
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:56.440]  They have worship services, they talk about Jesus, they preach the gospel, etc.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.960]  But every time when push comes to shove and you gotta make a decision, government is going
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.580]  to be the one that you side with.
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:08.100]  That's right, who you serve is who you obey.
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.000]  Exactly right, exactly right.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.780]  And who you give preference and who you give loyalty to and who you give sovereignty to.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:18.420]  And what's happened in our churches today is that they have fallen for this erroneous
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:23.760]  Romans 13 interpretation that Tim and I wrote about and you sell the book on your show and
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.560]  so many of your listeners and readers have purchased it.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:34.180]  That Romans 13 misinterpretation has propagandized the church, indoctrinated the church to the
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:38.900]  point that they're no longer able to properly analyze government from a biblical point of
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:39.900]  view.
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:45.900]  Hitler's most quoted passage in his radio addresses, do what I say Romans 13, do what
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:46.900]  I say Romans 13.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:51.000]  We're going to talk about that but first the gun grabbing, you'll be with us into the next
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.500]  hour with a pastor Greg Dixon who was not 501 C3 and so they seized the biggest church
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:57.660]  in America.
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.660]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:05.220]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:10.900]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:14.940]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:18.800]  You may think out of sight, out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.380]  The fact is you are, we all are.
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:23.580]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:28.620]  You might not be able to control mother nature but you can control your food prices by freezing

[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:13.460]  Here's stories up at Infowars.com right now.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:17.020]  Canadian woman arrested for Instagram photo of graffiti.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:18.020]  Unbelievable.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:24.180]  It's just a photo of somebody shot of graffiti.
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:26.180]  Gonna arrest Sylvester Stallone for his movies?
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.180]  You know, only individuals.
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:29.380]  They're getting us used to being disappeared.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:30.380]  Confirmed.

[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:36.180]  We already knew that they were keeping secret the drugs he was on, but now confirmed Holmes
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:37.700]  was on psychotropic drugs.
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.700]  Oh, really?

[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:46.620]  They fought for that not to come out, just like Adam Lanza.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:48.100]  Get that out to everybody.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:51.860]  University lockdown caused by zombie game, Nerf gun.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.580]  Oh, yeah, orange, pink guns, police gun, bubblegums, police guns.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:59.740]  Obama, I am constrained by the system our founders put in place, but he's not.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:01.020]  He's running over it.
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:05.860]  That's just some of the news right now up at Infowars.com.
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:09.280]  Parents who took kids back from CPS demonizes anti-government.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:18.020]  By the way, speaking of his book, it's available up at the website, infowarsstore.com, Romans
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:23.060]  13, the true meaning of submission.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:28.540]  And we're also carrying the film that I produced, Strategic Relocation, A Noble Lie, Exposing
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:32.940]  False Flag Terror, and After the Tribulation.
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:36.100]  And I wanna ask Pastor Baldwin his view on that because I just see the whole thing as
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:40.540]  a cop-out, whether it's pre, mid, post, whatever.
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:43.460]  But I always hear, well, it's the end of the world anyway, so why fight evil?
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.100]  Why not go out and warn people then?
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:47.940]  I think God's gonna say he didn't know you, but this is a short segment.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.220]  We're gonna have you with us into the next hour on Pastor Dixon, who was persecuted,
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:55.820]  biggest Baptist church, the biggest church in the country, period, because he wouldn't
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:59.020]  be under government control, thought I was in America.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:04.500]  But get into Franklin Graham, your article, the Southern Baptist Convention coming out
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:05.660]  and saying, get rid of the Second Amendment.
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.620]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:09.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:14.600]  I think it's imperative that Christians and non-Christians alike understand that this
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.980]  is a very, very serious attempt to dismantle the Second Amendment.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:23.420]  And unfortunately, we have many evangelical leaders such as Franklin Graham, Richard Land,
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:29.540]  and many others, who have taken the position that the state is always right, and that you
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:33.060]  never resist, you never question the state.
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:36.680]  And if the state says that you are to register your guns, then you're supposed to register
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:37.680]  your guns.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:41.200]  If a universal background check, then so be it.
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:46.280]  As we know, the FEMA camps have been, I'm excused, the FEMA has been instructing pastors
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:54.260]  for many years and schooling them in when the president declares a national emergency,
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:59.300]  asking the pastors to instruct the congregations to surrender their firearms.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.420]  This has been going on for years.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:02.220]  You've been reporting on this for years.
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.220]  So have I.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:08.460]  And by the way, four years before it was declassified, we broke it with Pastor Butch Paul, yourself
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:12.020]  and others here on Genesis, and we broke it nationally.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:15.740]  But people couldn't believe hundreds of pages of training manual.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:19.300]  They found out the pastor went and threatened him, kicked him out of the hospital where
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.340]  he did free ministry for people.
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:22.860]  And it gets worse.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:28.540]  There's the red light, FEMA training to take guns and have pastors prepared for it.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.320]  They're planning to come for the guns.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:34.620]  This is like catching, you know, the Nazis, you know, infiltrating the White House or
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.620]  the Chi Coms.
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:41.500]  I mean, this shows the authoritarian creeping nature that they're waiting for these shootings,
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:44.060]  which a lot of them they're staging.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:47.940]  Yeah, whether they're staged or not, the result is the same.
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:52.080]  They're using the opportunity to come after the people's guns.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:57.980]  And this is where I think that the book that Tim and I have written is so important, Alex.
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:03.700]  Seeing Christians that nowhere does the Bible teach that they are supposed to surrender
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.700]  their guns.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:09.640]  And even in the Garden of Gethsemane, when Jesus said to Simon Peter, put up thy sword,
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:12.060]  they that live by the sword die by the sword.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:15.140]  That has been misinterpreted so much by Christians through the years.
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:17.740]  It has nothing to do with surrendering your guns.
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:21.820]  In fact, Simon Peter kept his sword, put it in a scabbard.
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:23.700]  Jesus protected him.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.940]  The power of his voice knocked over the soldiers that came to arrest them.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:32.060]  Simon Peter and the other disciple that was armed walked out of the Garden of Eden with
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.060]  their arm.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:37.180]  By the way, it was against Roman law for them to carry a Roman sword.
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:38.180]  Absolutely.
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:39.180]  They were slaves.
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:40.180]  They were captured.
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.180]  Stay there.

[01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:54.940]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:59:00.140]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:01.140]  alone.
[01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:04.700]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:08.600]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.020]  The fact is you are.
[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.180]  We all are.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.380]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:18.460]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing

[01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:05.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:10.460]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.460]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:13.620]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:17.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:22.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:27.540]  All right, he's with us for another 30 minutes.
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:34.260]  He'll be riding shotgun with Dr. Greg Dixon and we're going to tell that story of a church
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:42.420]  now many years ago, was it 12 years ago, that their employees even paid taxes, paid the
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:43.420]  withholding, all that.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:47.220]  The church said, we're not going to handle money, we're not indentured servants, we don't
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:51.540]  have to do this, we're not under the government, we don't want your 501c3.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:55.580]  And they came and stole their church and arrested everybody.
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:58.660]  And that's Soviet Union, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:02.620]  That's why the churches have all rolled over and said, we'll push abortion, we'll say turn
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:03.820]  the guns in.
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:09.020]  Billy Graham's son is out there saying you don't need guns.
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:10.020]  It is so demonic.
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:13.300]  And I can't wait to read your new book if it's anything like Romans 13 full of all the
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:15.080]  quotes to give to these preachers.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.580]  They already know the truth.
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:18.860]  But again, they don't really want to be preachers.
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:20.840]  They want to be married to the state.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.020]  They are high priest of the state run churches.
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:29.040]  Let's go back to Chuck Baldwin, Chuck, you were trying to get into Romans 13.
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.560]  What should we be saying to Franklin Graham and the rest of these people that say, turn
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.900]  your guns in?
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:36.900]  The big Catholic newspaper said, quote, repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:37.900]  Yeah.
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:38.900]  Yeah.
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:43.780]  What are they going to do with the words of Jesus when he told the disciples that if they
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:48.300]  needed to sell their clothes, whatever they had to do, go buy a sword?
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.100]  What are they going to do with that?
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:55.260]  What are they going to do with the fact that Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:56.580]  Old Testament?
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:03.820]  And we have the command of God in the Old Testament of many of the deliverers of Israel
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:07.780]  to arm themselves and to defend and to conquer.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:10.300]  God never told his people to lay down.
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:11.300]  No, never.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:12.640]  They always resisted.
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:17.620]  If you were going to take out of the Bible all of the stories of resistance, you would
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:21.620]  reduce the Bible by probably 60 or 65%.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:26.060]  Many of the great stories that we revere as Christians in the word of God, both Old and
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:31.020]  New Testaments, have to do with resisting civil authority, all the way from Daniel-
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.020]  That's right.
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:37.040]  The authorities are always resisted and always put in the, but the love stuff, turn the other
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.140]  cheek is with your family, with people around you trying to work things out.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:46.480]  That's where a correct pastor, we see the turning the other cheek, not letting people
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.480]  set you up.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  Go ahead.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.660]  Well, yeah, and all this is covered in our book, To Keep or Not To Keep, why Christians
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:54.460]  should not give up their guns.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:58.980]  We go into all these passages of scripture and we deal with them individually, one by
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:04.980]  one, and we show that it does not teach submission to tyranny, that just the opposite is taught.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.920]  There is a revealed and natural law given by God for self-defense.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.740]  That is an inalienable right- Weapons everywhere, restrain evil, as Thomas
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:16.440]  Jefferson said.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.120]  It is a biblical principle.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.160]  It is a natural law principle.
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:23.940]  It's founded and grounded in the word of God and the presets of scripture.
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:29.820]  And for Christians to take the tack that government is God, and that we are to do whatever government
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.740]  says regardless of how scriptural or unscriptural might be, is idolatry.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:37.340]  I mean, let's call it what it is, Alex, it's idolatry.
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:39.560]  It is the worship of the state.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.400]  And what I'm concerned about is that there are many pastors and Christians out there
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.600]  that really aren't maybe in their hearts understanding what they're doing.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:55.100]  But they've been taught this so long and so often that they just think that's the only
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:56.680]  accepted theology.
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.780]  They've never been taught anything else.
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:05.680]  That's why in 1775 and 76, Jonas Clark had instructed his congregants at the Church of
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:12.960]  Lexington for years before the events of April 19, 1775 on Lexington Green, which took place
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.920]  right in front of the church house where those men worshiped every Sunday.
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:22.860]  And so whenever that day came and they marched on Concord to seize the arms, they were able
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:27.440]  to stand in front of them, those minutemen that were mainly the church congregation of
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:31.880]  the Church of Lexington, Pastor Jonas Clark, they were able to do that because the pastor
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.120]  had taught them the principles of liberty for many, many, many years.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:39.120]  Well, most of the militias were led by the preachers.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.600]  That's why the King of England said, damn these black brigades.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:44.600]  That's right.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:51.040]  And when we have a quote, we've resurrected the black regiment on my website at ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.360]  If you're looking for a black regiment church, you might find one there.
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.360]  Absolutely.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:57.840]  Resurrecting the black regiment.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.840]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:03.720]  We have a question coming up.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:10.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.640]  Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:15.960]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:23.240]  that are earth friendly and safe.

[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:06.180]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.480]  good sized meal that I was still starving.
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:13.280]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:17.440]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:23.000]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.200]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:32.500]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.

[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.560]  All right, if you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubted persecution
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:39.840]  against Christians, libertarians, conservatives, anti-abortion people, pro-lifers, pro-second
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.200]  amendment groups.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.720]  We get countless calls on air, I see it in the news, all I do is read news all day, where
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.160]  they'll say, yeah, a man arrested for his bumper sticker, pro-life bumper sticker.
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:54.520]  And you're like, that's gotta be a joke.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:01.680]  Or family went to anti-government rally, children taken, or anti-government people wouldn't
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.520]  give kids vaccines, children taken.
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:07.000]  There is no law to take the vaccines.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.720]  But the family courts aren't real courts, they're so devilish.
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:14.960]  They were set up as a race sterilization operation in 1910 in New York.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.680]  See, I know the whole history of it.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:22.560]  We were like, well, the judge said we didn't give them the shots, so they took the kids.
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.880]  And they just eyeball, they think you're ignorant, and you don't know how to fight back.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:29.040]  They go, sign this, you'll get your kids back.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:32.320]  When you sign it, you're admitting you're bad, and then through fraud, they go, I've
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:33.320]  got the confession.
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.240]  I mean, these are authoritarian criminals all over the place.
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:42.320]  And look, if you're good cops out there, and you're getting mad hearing this, well, you're
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.480]  guilty.
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.560]  Because I'm not talking about you, the system is corrupt.
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:50.800]  There's no doubt some jurisdictions are better, haven't been totally taken over, but this
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:54.380]  country is evil.
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:56.640]  This country has rationalized and rationalized.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.800]  Now, I wanna read to you the, in fact, will you guys pull up the First Amendment online
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:01.800]  for me?
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.880]  I need to have my pocket Constitution, it's normally in here, somebody picked it up.
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.840]  All orders of books and videos get a free pocket Constitution.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:16.480]  First Amendment starts with, Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.120]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.480]  And then it goes on, or freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, or the right to assemble
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.480]  the redress of grievances.
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:31.000]  But there it is, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.760]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press,
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.140]  or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for redress
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:39.140]  of grievance.
[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:44.200]  Okay, now, you never heard it was Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.780]  of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:53.840]  This country, my dad's family goes back to the Mayflower, this is very rare, by the way.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.280]  It's 200 plus thousand Americans that are living, had somebody on the Mayflower.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:02.320]  My mother had two people on the Mayflower, I forget his name, the barrel maker and the
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:06.960]  famous woman, they got married, the lowest guy on the totem pole was the barrel maker.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:12.040]  They got married, that's my ancestors, and then my dad's side, kind of a scoundrel of
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:13.960]  a guy, but the captain of the Mayflower.
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:19.560]  Now the whole point here is, ladies and gentlemen, they had gone, and my mother's gone and visited
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:24.320]  where my family was from in England, and then went over to the Netherlands.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:30.880]  She's been over there, where they have the original little churches of the pilgrims.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:34.800]  They were going all over the place trying to just try to read the Bible and not worship
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:35.800]  government.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.700]  Because everywhere else you had a government run church, and they spied on you, they didn't
[02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:40.800]  teach the Bible.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:44.680]  Didn't matter whether it was England's fake Protestant churches, from their perspective,
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.760]  the Catholic Church, all of it, it all became political.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:49.760]  And so that happened.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:51.260]  So I wanna explain something to you.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:56.680]  This country was founded on religious freedom, and they could still never get it in the colonies,
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:01.060]  because people would take over and try to make you follow their version.
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:06.240]  So when you see the churches saying, we're 501 C3, which just turns them into a government
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:08.040]  charity, a government corporation.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:13.080]  See, in the 50s, all the denominations said, shine on to this, you still get your tax exemption.
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:17.080]  And they got tricked, really, and it was a contract fraud, going from a church outside
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.160]  jurisdiction into a contract.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.920]  Now, Pastor Greg Dixon had the biggest standalone church in the country, and it was all over
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:26.920]  60 minutes, you name it.
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.240]  Anti-globalist, anti-New World Order, just Bible believing.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:36.300]  Biggest church in Indianapolis, Baptist temple, 8,000 plus member, 41 years.
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:43.280]  And his son now pastors it, but they had been 501 C3, and he can tell the story better than
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:46.600]  I, and then I've got Chuck Baldwin with him to go back and forth here.
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:49.840]  But the point is, is that they came and took their church.
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:52.060]  Now, they said, well, you've got to pay taxes.
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:57.820]  Their church members paid the fake income tax, but it's not the church's job to collect
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:00.920]  it and run it, that's engendered servitude.
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:07.480]  And now, you see the churches of America starting to say, abortion's good, turn our guns in
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.680]  are good, they're not even churches.
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:12.280]  And in just a decade, this has happened.
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.200]  And now they have the clergy response teams, mainstream news, telling their flocks, turn
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:18.080]  your guns in, it's of the Lord.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:21.680]  America, the National Catholic Review, repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:24.200]  This is happening.
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.900]  And whether you're Catholic, Protestant, whatever it is, and even if you're not a, quote, Christian,
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.780]  you better be concerned.
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:33.160]  Because when the churches become state run, you've got authoritarianism.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:37.120]  Now, Chuck Baldwin, you wanna introduce this topic, because I know you're an expert on
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:42.600]  as well, and then bring up Pastor Greg Dixon, a graduate of the Baptist Bible College, Springsville,
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:44.720]  Missouri in 1953.
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:49.240]  And of course, the famous Baptist preacher in his own right, I'm not gonna go over his
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.240]  whole bio.
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:55.480]  There was a 91-day, quote, siege, where they wouldn't leave the church, but the media called
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:57.880]  it a siege, like they were terrorists.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.920]  And we'll give you their website as well.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:06.040]  I mean, I'm ranting here, because this is so evil, and it's just accepted now.
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:11.000]  So explain what's happening here, and did I break it down correctly, Pastor Chuck Baldwin?
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.800]  Yeah, yes, you did, and Greg and I go back a long ways, he's a dear friend, I'm glad
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:17.680]  you got him on.
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:19.520]  Everybody should be familiar with this story.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.120]  What you said is exactly right.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:28.360]  Greg Dixon was preaching the gospel without the 501c3 tax exempt status.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:32.240]  The tax issue that you described was what happened, and they came in.
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.200]  And by the way, people need to realize that this took place under the Bush administration,
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  GW Bush.
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:45.680]  In fact, this is one of the first things that the new GW Bush administration did, was seize
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:52.720]  Indianapolis Baptist Temple, first time in history that a church in the United States
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:55.800]  had been seized by the federal government.
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:59.440]  And that happened under a Republican presidential administration.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:02.680]  And we know why, because they were getting ready with a faith-based initiative to buy
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:07.600]  off the churches, so they had to get rid of the major group that was resisting it.
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:10.960]  I think they wanted to make Greg an example.
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.280]  He was the guy that they saw as the thorn in their side, and they wanted to make him
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:17.280]  an example.
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:18.280]  And that's exactly what they did.
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.480]  They didn't kill the church, his son is still pastoring, they're still growing, they're
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:27.060]  still preaching, they're still winning souls, they're doing a great job for the Lord.
[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:32.800]  But they definitely seized the church, and they sent a message to preachers all over
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:37.840]  America that you better kowtow to the IRS or we're gonna come and get you.
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.160]  And again, spun it in the media like they stole money and demanded millions.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:45.800]  Every dime had been paid to the offshore Federal Reserve crime group.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.200]  They just had the members of the church individually do it, because Congress can make no law respecting
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:54.600]  an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:57.360]  Pastor Greg Dixon, thank you for joining us today.
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:02.440]  I wanna get into your story for people, but you broke it all down, or you could say prophesied
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.520]  it wasn't hard to do, that as you guys went down, the church would become a pure organ
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:08.720]  of Satan.
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:11.360]  And now by and large, it has become that.
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.120]  Well thank you very much, I appreciate being on the program today and appreciate the great
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:16.400]  work that you're doing.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:17.400]  Thank you sir.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:26.320]  I'm holding in my hands right here, the front page of the Indianapolis Star, Wednesday,
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:34.080]  February the 14th, 2001, the headline says, Feds Seize Baptist Temple.
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.680]  And the front page has the picture-
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:38.640]  You just show viewers.
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:46.160]  100 federal marshals came in and broke down the doors of the Indianapolis Baptist Temple.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:48.600]  And it says, Feds Seize Baptist Temple.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:54.440]  Well they didn't, thank God, they didn't seize the Baptist Temple.
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:17:02.240]  They did carry some of us out, but we were seen worshiping together the next night at
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:06.400]  the Jonathan Bird's cafeteria, the convention center out there.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:08.520]  So they stole the land and the building, they didn't-
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.640]  Worshiping together ever since.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:19.000]  So they did seize the buildings and sold off $6 million worth of property, 22 acres of
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.640]  land right in the middle of Indianapolis.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:27.080]  And sold for a million and a half, and there's where we had a Christian school, they now
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:28.440]  have a charter school.
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.080]  We say they have a communist school now, where we were teaching the Bible, they're teaching
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:38.480]  atheism, where we were teaching the free enterprise system, they're teaching communism, where
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.920]  we were teaching creationism, they're teaching Darwinism.
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:46.760]  So anyway, they've got their charter school there now, but the church is still going right
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:48.800]  on, praise God for that.
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:51.280]  But nevertheless, the church is still there.
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:58.760]  I think it's very important, and it's good to be united with my good friend Chuck Baldwin
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:17:59.760]  again.
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:01.720]  We've been good friends for a long, long time.
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:06.700]  We were comrades together in arms with more majority back in the 80s.
[02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:09.280]  It's always good to be with Chuck again.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:13.360]  And he's a great soldier of the cross, I will assure you that.
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:20.280]  But I think it's important for people to understand that under communism in China, they had the
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.240]  three self movement.
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:30.120]  The three self movement was this, state recognized churches, state financed churches, and then
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.580]  the church was to espouse state propaganda.
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:38.000]  That's exactly what we have in America.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:47.840]  We have state recognized churches through incorporation, through 501c3 recognition under
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:49.720]  the IRS.
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:57.160]  Then you've got state financed churches through the tax deductible gift and tax exemption.
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:02.680]  And then the churches are to espouse federal public policy.
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:04.520]  That's exactly where we are.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:09.160]  The reason that the churches won't take a stand and the pastors won't take a stand is
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:14.360]  because they don't want to give up their tax exemption and they don't want to give up their
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:24.280]  tax deductible gifts because this is all of the religious organizations in America who
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:25.760]  are not churches.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:28.520]  They couldn't exist without the tax deductible gifts.
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:31.280]  So they're worshiping the golden calf.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.280]  That's right.
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:36.480]  And the churches could not exist without the tax deductible gift.
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:43.240]  The First Baptist Church of Dallas, downtown Dallas, they have just built a massive, massive
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.680]  new building project right downtown Dallas.
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:51.120]  They couldn't do it without that's where my grandma went when she, you know, I tell you
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.120]  what, stay there.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:53.460]  We're going to come back and talk about what this means.
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:59.520]  Even if you're not a Christian, folks, having a state run church means look out, look out.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.520]  We are in trouble.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:06.880]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the info wars dot com team want to relay to
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:12.560]  you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:17.800]  front info wars dot com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:23.260]  But we can't do that without your help by getting the films, bumper stickers and T shirts
[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:24.760]  and info wars dot com.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:31.780]  You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:35.240]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:41.440]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:48.920]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.320]  and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:52.800]  The war is here.
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:21:02.040]  It's an info war, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.960]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.160]  afford to pay your electric bill.
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:09.920]  That's closer than you think.
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:13.220]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:18.000]  what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400%
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.800]  in coming months.
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:29.200]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.160]  out across America.
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:32.560]  But here's some good news.
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:38.300]  There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used
[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:42.000]  to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:47.200]  The video at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:51.260]  doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:55.680]  So watch it now at Exposed123.com before it's too late.
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:57.680]  Again, that's Exposed123.com.

[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:31.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.760]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:35.760]  IRAs?
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:39.780]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:41.480]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:44.960]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:49.960]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:55.640]  To get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.640 --> 02:23:00.360]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:02.760]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:06.260]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:09.960]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:15.000]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry and
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  my guns.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.400]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that deadbolts
[02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:26.560]  alone don't stop intruders.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.920]  The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:32.920]  stop an intruder.
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:37.600]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:38.600]  kick-ins.
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:44.520]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:55.120]  Visit easyarmor.net, that's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net or call 888-58-ARMER, that's 888-582-7667.

[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:11.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, live
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:15.400]  back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News and I'll be back live this Sunday
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:19.880]  as I am every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., I wasn't live obviously on Easter, we'll be live this
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:24.600]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m., we're going to have a live report from the DMZ, it'll be 7 a.m.
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:29.240]  Monday this time with Dr. Pechenik there on the North Korea situation, if stuff happens
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:34.280]  I'll be in here doing live feeds on the audio and video streams at infowarsnews.com and
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:35.280]  prisonplanet.tv.
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.360]  Chuck Baldwin's riding shotgun with us for another 20 minutes or so and then we're going
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:43.060]  to go right up to near the end of the show with Dr. Dickson, I have a couple of special
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:49.120]  reports I'm going to air before the main broadcast ends but here's my bottom line, Pastor Dickson,
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.040]  I want you to recap your story and then now what you see happening with the churches and
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:58.800]  then I get Pastor Baldwin's take on it but it's simple, people that give in to corrupt
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:05.120]  governments they get totally overrun because then even more evil people who will push it
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:08.960]  further will get into government and then more evil and more evil so you end up getting
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:14.180]  kind of a survival of the most evil and that's why you end up with human sacrifice in every
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:21.120]  culture, mass death, worship of government and this worship of government is the opposite
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:28.200]  of what was given to the Israelites by God was the first time you don't worship government,
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:29.200]  you worship God.
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:33.800]  It's like they said to, hey Saul you don't want a king, Israel you don't want a king
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:40.920]  and you follow what God says and so no one can then dispute that and so we are the sovereigns
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:45.280]  here with only God above us not the state above us because whoever you put above you
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:50.840]  is God and we've now made the state God and it's now acting like God and it's now saying
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:57.840]  it's God and Chris Rock is saying Obama is our father, no El Jefe is not my father, okay,
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:02.640]  my physical father is David Jones but my spiritual father is Jesus Christ, what do you say to
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:03.640]  that?
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:10.440]  Well what you're saying is absolutely correct but we're going through the same thing that
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:15.880]  Daniel went through with Nebuchadnezzar that the three Hebrew children went through that
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.920]  the pastors went through with Hitler and let me read it to you, let me show you what I'm
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:23.920]  talking about.
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:36.040]  In 1998 under Clinton, under the Clinton administration, this has all been documented, all of the alphabet
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:48.720]  soup agencies including the CIA, the FBI, the IRS under the Janet Reno Justice Department
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:27:00.640]  came together in the White House and the not-for-profit division of the IRS that controls 750,000 churches
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:09.560]  in America and their purpose of the meeting was to devise a plan classified as top secret
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:20.160]  called Operation D and to devise a plan to control all uncooperative churches in America,
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:32.560]  to put together a plan and they said that their plan was a five-pronged plan, it included
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:38.440]  the financial power of the IRS, international pressures using the treaty powers of the UN,
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:44.840]  the investigative and intelligence forces of the FBI, CIA and NSA, the judicial and
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:51.920]  prosecutorial assets of the US Justice Department and federal courts and congressional legislations.
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:59.840]  Now they used all five of these against our church to bring us down, our church was the
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:10.200]  first church that they used to bring pressure and to muscle us down, our first church.
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.480]  This is pure authoritarianism, when reporters get detained in China, it's national news
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:19.920]  but then we get arrested trying to do interviews or trying to hand out literature now or get
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:23.360]  tickets, I mean we have become an authoritarian state.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:30.240]  Now prior to this, TCAN in Texas and I'm not going into this in great detail but prior
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:39.240]  to this, an organization called TCAN in Texas went through thousands and thousands and thousands
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:46.280]  of United Nations documents and came to the conclusion that the goal of the United Nations
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:57.280]  is to eliminate every local church on earth, to eliminate every local church on earth.
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:03.640]  Now that's what this whole issue of Islam is about right now.
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:10.040]  They're using Islam now to destroy Christianity and then they'll turn around after they get
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:15.920]  through with that, then they'll end up, then they will destroy Islam.
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:18.560]  But right now they're using Islam to destroy Christianity.
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:22.840]  Exactly, notice how they can't have Legos of Jabba the Hutt saying it's anti-Islam,
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:27.720]  has nothing to do with Islam, they're using it as political correctness to bring in and
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:33.320]  say you can't criticize Islam out of the Bible or you can't criticize homosexuality or you
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:39.000]  can't because that violates hate speech to shut down and bring in one world religion
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.880]  that the UN openly is calling for.
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:45.720]  Pastor Dixon stay there, Pastor Baldwin, I'm going to get your take on this when we come
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:50.520]  back and everybody get the book Romans 13 at mfowarsstore.com.

[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:08.920]  economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:14.960]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:15.960]  to the global takeover.
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:21.960]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at mfowarsshop.com.

[02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:20.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:24.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:32.280]  When I learn about how they're persecuting Christians or anybody, I take it personal.
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:33.280]  I feel it.
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:36.400]  And it's not because I'm some goody two shoes, bleeding heart person.
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:37.480]  I have empathy.
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:39.120]  God gave us that.
[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:42.480]  And I've just noticed that most people that don't believe in God and certainly state has
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.560]  used religion, religion has been used for great mass murder.
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:46.680]  I don't deny that.
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:49.540]  But look at the communists, the greatest mass murderers in history.
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:53.080]  They're anti-Christian and Christians having to literally run to the hills.
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:57.960]  They just recently found families, you know, living out multigeneration Christians from
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:04.040]  Ukraine who had gone hundreds of miles into the mountains in Siberia to survive.
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:07.280]  And this is the type of world we're talking about.
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:15.720]  And I think about my listeners, the family, the Haken family, where they claim they were
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:16.820]  at a Tea Party event.
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:19.480]  They rented their hotel room and found a small amount of marijuana.
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:20.480]  They're both engineers.
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:21.760]  He's an Air Force veteran.
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.500]  Probably isn't even true.
[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:28.160]  And because I grew up in Dallas where the cops would plant drugs on people and witnessed
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.160]  it.
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:31.520]  And I'm not saying all police are bad, but the state is bad.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:36.160]  Those directing the state from on top are bad.
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:41.160]  And I got physically, it was beyond hatred, beyond anger.
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:43.460]  It's more of a sorrow, but just sick of it.
[02:34:43.460 --> 02:34:45.400]  Like, why are we so weak?
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:47.320]  Why have we let the evil get so bad?
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:52.460]  And it was the realization last night that it's gonna get so much worse, folks.
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:57.320]  Because people think by giving into evil that somehow it makes everything okay.
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:34:58.320]  No, no, no.
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:34:59.320]  It sinks to the bottom.
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:06.280]  And I wanted to ask Pastor Baldwin, before we go back to Pastor Greg Dixon here, of ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:10.240]  You can go to thebiblicallawcenter.com for Pastor Dixon's excellent site.
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:13.880]  And everybody needs to direct their pastors and preachers to this, cuz I'm not even judging
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:18.360]  people that are 501c3 and don't really know or they don't really understand.
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:20.360]  You need to go convict them.
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:22.600]  You need to give the book Romans 13 to them.
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:25.520]  You need to send them to the Bible Law Center.
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:29.160]  Because it was our churches that led the war against King George.
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:33.520]  And it's gonna be the churches that lead in the forced inoculation, the gun confiscation.
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:39.240]  I can play newscast where they say, we are training for gun confiscation, forced inoculation
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.400]  and to tell the families to go to the famous center.
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:44.680]  It's of the Lord, Romans 13, do what you're told.
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:46.920]  I mean, I've played that clip probably 100 times.
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:50.920]  Just type in clergy response team into YouTube, you'll get the newscast.
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.800]  Four years after we broke it, okay?
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:59.560]  It's so creepy that they've been training the preachers to tell their flocks just like
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:00.720]  in Red Dawn.
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:05.440]  They use the mayor and the preacher when the Soviets take over to go, I mean, this is classic
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:08.300]  right out of an authoritarian novel.
[02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:10.760]  That's what I'm getting at.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:12.160]  People got to wake up.
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.240]  What do you call waking up or being in denial?
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:16.880]  Because the people are given a great delusion.
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:19.680]  I mean, the Bible talks about they were given great delusion.
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:25.640]  You've got to be in a flaming delusion to not see that evil is just going hog wild and
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:28.200]  that it's going to persecute good people.
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:32.740]  Even if you go along with the New World Order but secretly love God and you have a good
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:34.600]  heart, they're coming after you.
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:35.600]  That's what I'm seeing.
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:41.300]  The system releases criminals, pays al-Qaeda to murder Christian communities in Syria.
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:47.800]  I mean, the system hates good people and not all departments are like this, but you can
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:51.100]  see, like the Bible says, certain cities get taken over by evil.
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:54.760]  You can see the evil cities versus the ones that aren't fully taken over.
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:59.760]  But the body snatcher operation is ongoing in every town now.
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:01.820]  Evil is on the offense right now.
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:05.680]  And I want to ask who will, you know, lift up a standard, the spirit of the Lord to lift
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.400]  up a standard of when the enemy comes in like a flood pastor?
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:14.060]  And the only ones to do that are the pastors.
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:16.140]  They are the key.
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:22.300]  Back in 1775 and 1776, if it were not for the colonial pastors, the so-called Black
[02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:27.020]  Robe Regiment, there would have been no Bunker Hill, there would have been no Lexington Green,
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:31.900]  there would have been no Concord Bridge, no Declaration of Independence, no Constitution,
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:34.860]  there would have been no United States of America.
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:40.380]  It was the pastors of colonial America that literally led the war for independence.
[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:45.100]  They preached, they taught, they exemplified, many of them participated.
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:48.380]  And the enemy knows that, that's why they're going after them today.
[02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:49.380]  Absolutely.
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:50.380]  That's why they're neutered.
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:57.460]  And that was such a stroke of diabolical genius back in the 1950s when Lyndon Johnson created
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:38:00.500]  the 501c3 tax exempt status.
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:04.640]  It really was, from a diabolical point of view, it was a stroke of genius.
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:10.260]  Because what it did, it allowed the government to control the churches, and the preaching
[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:18.140]  especially, the preaching of the churches via the threat of the loss of tax exempt status
[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:20.780]  with the IRS codes 501c3.
[02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:28.100]  So what's happened since, and coupled with the Romans 13 misinterpretation, obey the
[02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:34.820]  government no matter what, what you have is a double whammy against the pastors and churches.
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:42.060]  And the result is what we have today, a neutered, silent, scared, pitiful, pathetic pulpit,
[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:48.040]  until the pastors begin to awaken, energize their congregations.
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:50.700]  And preach- Have you heard churches all over the place
[02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:53.020]  are being told, pull the crosses out?
[02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:55.660]  I mean, pretty soon there'll be nothing.
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:38:56.940]  I've heard of that.
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:02.500]  And I keep hearing more and more of this type of activity taking place, and you gotta ask
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:05.900]  yourself, where's it gonna stop, and the fact is, it's never gonna stop.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:10.580]  But these churches have been indoctrinated also in the universities, and the Christian
[02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:12.300]  colleges, and the seminaries.
[02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:14.440]  It's all about success, Alex.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:15.700]  It's about money.
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:17.900]  It's about 401k retirement.
[02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:19.660]  It's about insurance plans.
[02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:21.000]  It's about getting ahead.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.820]  It's about using the current church- Well, they could just turn the church into
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:26.900]  a swinger's club then, maybe that'd get more people in the door.
[02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:30.600]  Well, unfortunately, there's probably too much of that going on too.
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:37.220]  But the fact is that what they've done is that they've created this social organization
[02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:39.900]  that is success-oriented.
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:46.340]  It's all about climbing the ladder, just like a businessman who wants to further his business-
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:47.340]  Absolutely.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:51.200]  I'm gonna bring you back in a moment to talk about the Second Amendment issue with Pastor
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.200]  Dixon.
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:54.140]  But let's get Pastor Dixon's take on this.
[02:39:54.140 --> 02:39:56.540]  How do we reverse this, these points I've made?
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:59.480]  The persecution of good people is accelerating.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:08.020]  But not only that, many of these men, even fundamentalist men, are sincere in believing
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:18.380]  that soul winning is the most important thing, therefore, they are justified in taking these
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:25.660]  not-for-profit gifts, they are justified in compromising, so to speak, as long as they're
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:27.700]  winning souls.
[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:35.620]  And we've got to somehow break through this malaise, somehow we have to break through.
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:40.940]  See, for instance, the preachers are saying, well, they're not telling me what to preach.
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:47.620]  Well, that's like saying, well, they're not telling me not to speed.
[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:54.640]  Well, you drive down the highway and you see a speed limit sign and it says 50 miles an
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:56.620]  hour speed limit.
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:41:04.300]  Well, just because a policeman doesn't come to you personally and say you're not to speed,
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:06.940]  that doesn't mean you're not supposed to speed.
[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:13.540]  Well, just because the head of the IRS, the not-for-profit division of the IRS doesn't
[02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:18.740]  come to you and say personally to you or you don't get a letter from them saying you're
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:25.660]  not to espouse federal public policy or that you're not supposed to endorse candidates
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:32.220]  or specific legislation doesn't mean that you're not supposed to do those things.
[02:41:32.220 --> 02:41:36.260]  You can read the contract, you can read what the law says.
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:37.260]  Now, for instance-
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:41.500]  That's right, you've signed a covenant, so don't cop out and say you haven't.
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:46.340]  And look what's happened to the churches and look at how selectively all the pro-abortion,
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:49.940]  all the anti-gun churches, they can say who to vote for.
[02:41:49.940 --> 02:41:54.860]  But if you get a constitutional church out there saying something, here comes the IRS,
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.780]  what's the IRS doing in a church?
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:42:01.300]  The answer is you're not a church now, you are a government corporation.
[02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:02.300]  That's exactly correct.
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:03.540]  Now let me show you.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:14.140]  The IRS is keep every single preacher in America who speaks out on any public policy issue
[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:19.020]  and it gets in the newspapers, it gets on television or radio.
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:27.980]  The IRS is keeping a file on that preacher, the date that they gave that speech or the
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:32.220]  sermon, whether it was on the internet or wherever it was.
[02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:33.220]  Let me give you an example.
[02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:34.780]  That's church police.
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:37.540]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:41.860]  They kept a secret file on me that went clear back to 1971.
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:47.380]  I'm just gonna give you a few of the headlines that was out of the Indianapolis Star.
[02:42:47.380 --> 02:42:52.300]  1971, Baptist High School to stress Bible.
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:57.100]  1978, Reverend Dixon fights daycare license.
[02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:00.460]  1978, church plans tech school.
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:05.860]  1981, pornography target of downtown rally attended by 1000.
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:10.340]  1983, Reverend Dixon opposes lottery bill.
[02:43:10.340 --> 02:43:13.740]  1983, churches to fight encroachment.
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:18.220]  1985, state laws may collide with church.
[02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:22.460]  1986, group to obey Jesus, not government.
[02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:25.940]  1987, Dixon opposes governor or on school.
[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:31.780]  And they're putting this in the newspaper because as if it's a list of your crimes,
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:35.980]  my gosh, a church went down and rallied against pornography.
[02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:37.060]  They're not allowed to do that.
[02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:39.540]  I mean, what country is this?
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:40.740]  What's the world coming to?
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:44.460]  A church against pornography?
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:45.780]  Now listen to this one.
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:51.080]  How many churches, how many preachers, Chuck, have you heard say, well, but when they tell
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.860]  me they can't, I can't preach against homosexuality, I'll do something.
[02:43:55.860 --> 02:43:57.380]  Listen to this one.
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:04.180]  Gays urge panel to include them in anti-bias bill.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:05.180]  But guess what?
[02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:07.260]  Old big mouth was there.
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:12.380]  It was opposed by Reverend Greg Dixon, 1990.
[02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:16.300]  That was the headlines in the Indianapolis Star.
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:17.860]  Now this was just a few of them.
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:22.020]  I don't, I'm not going to take time on the broadcast today to read all of them.
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:27.860]  This was in, this was in, we got this through discovery.
[02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:29.060]  This was in our file.
[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:31.420]  We got it through discovery.
[02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:35.380]  They'd kept a secret file on me since 1971.
[02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:37.980]  You think they don't have a file on Chuck Baldwin?
[02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:42.740]  You don't think they have a file on Jeffers, First Baptist Church in Dallas?
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:46.660]  You don't think they have a file on every preacher in America that's speaking out on
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.740]  these public issue policy issues?
[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:53.220]  This is, listen, fusion centers, that term comes directly out of East Germany.
[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:56.460]  They, when I first heard this 12 years ago, I didn't believe it.
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:58.160]  I looked up the federal purchase orders.
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:02.860]  They hired Marcus Wolf for three years to set up Homeland Security, the former head
[02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:03.980]  of the Stasi.
[02:45:03.980 --> 02:45:06.220]  This is directly out of East Germany.
[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:11.060]  They actually shut up what we're now seeing launch in America.
[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:14.740]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:20.140]  And you can say all you want to about, well, we're going to get some attorney to help us.
[02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:23.700]  We're going to get some attorney to fight for us.
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:25.700]  These attorneys will run.
[02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:31.740]  They'll have their tail between their legs because in the first place, the minute you
[02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:35.100]  get into court, they're going to say you signed the contract.
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:36.100]  You signed the contract.
[02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:41.080]  Isn't that the problem in America is that, I mean, I don't think of myself as a tough
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:45.540]  guy or something, but I have no fear of them coming after me, what may be in the newspaper.
[02:45:45.540 --> 02:45:46.780]  They may set me up.
[02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:50.300]  I just have peace other than wanting to resist them.
[02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:51.860]  I don't have peace there.
[02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:54.940]  What happened to the spirit in America?
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:59.020]  Because I'm a pretty wicked devil, and I absolutely in my heart want to resist these people in
[02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:00.020]  my soul.
[02:46:00.020 --> 02:46:01.460]  Where are the men today?
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:02.460]  Where are the people?
[02:46:02.460 --> 02:46:06.180]  I mean, they don't even hardly protest abortion anymore in this country.
[02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:07.180]  Where is it?
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:09.620]  I guess we're just going down.
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:16.380]  That's one of the reasons that, see, the Bible says rebellion is worse than witchcraft.
[02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:25.700]  When our church was a corporation, a 501C3 nonprofit corporation, we obeyed all the laws.
[02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:28.100]  We withheld taxes.
[02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:29.100]  We did everything.
[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:30.740]  We dotted every I.
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:32.900]  We crossed every T. We did everything.
[02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:40.900]  But when we unincorporated, when we got out of the system, when we were no longer a 501C3,
[02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:42.840]  we said no more.
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:44.260]  We didn't do any of those things.
[02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:48.140]  We stopped being a tax collector for the government.
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:56.600]  We stopped paying, collecting federal income tax.
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.980]  And our position was that these people are not employees.
[02:47:00.980 --> 02:47:01.980]  They're ministers-
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:07.200]  Well, they spin it like it's demonic to resist a corrupt government.
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:08.940]  But I mean, resisting is one thing.
[02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:12.020]  I mean, obviously, rebelling against God is super evil.
[02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:16.220]  But they call churches rebellious that don't submit to the government.
[02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:18.020]  What do you say to that Romans 13 issue?
[02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:24.540]  Well, in the first place, if you've signed the contract, you better obey the contract.
[02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:28.020]  But that's what the biblical law center does.
[02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:34.460]  We help churches to organize and reorganize so they can be free from 501C3.
[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:36.820]  And they're doing that successfully by the thousands.
[02:47:36.820 --> 02:47:41.100]  Well, I'm not saying they're doing it by the thousands.
[02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:42.100]  No, no.
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:44.960]  There are a lot of churches starting and a lot of the ones that are- I mean, I got friends
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:48.620]  right out here that go to churches that have been around for decades that aren't 501C3.
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:49.620]  I know.
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:55.500]  But there's more to it than just- I mean, you've got to- that's why the biblical law
[02:47:55.500 --> 02:48:01.540]  center is trying to- it's more through it than just- I'm telling you, there's more to
[02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:02.540]  it.
[02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:06.260]  We'll get you on for a full hour sometime just to get into the law aspects.
[02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:07.900]  I know you've been through it yourself.
[02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:08.900]  You're the experts on it.
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:12.220]  But I wanted to get Chuck Baldwin's take here on the state of the Second Amendment and then
[02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:14.740]  get your take, Pastor Dixon.
[02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:17.880]  I mean, now the churches- well, let me ask Dixon briefly.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:21.960]  What do you make of the first, you know, the Southern Baptist and all the rest of them
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:24.980]  coming out and saying, basically, turn in your guns to the government?
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:34.380]  Well, in the first place, we're seeing now a specific line between fundamentalists and
[02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:35.380]  evangelicals.
[02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:38.500]  And we've been trying to tell them that all along.
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:42.020]  There's a difference between fundamentalists and evangelicals.
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:46.120]  And so these wimpy evangelicals now are wimping out.
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:49.700]  And so we're seeing it now.
[02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:56.380]  And so the evangelicals, they want to be seen as these nice guys and go-along guys and to
[02:48:56.380 --> 02:48:58.020]  get-along guys.
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:01.780]  And so they're saying, well, we can give in and we can give in on it.
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:04.180]  And they're doing the same thing on the immigration.
[02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:08.020]  They're saying, well, I was a stranger and we took them in.
[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:15.380]  Well, I appreciate that verse, but it doesn't mean that you have to take some wicked people
[02:49:15.380 --> 02:49:19.980]  into your home and turn your children over to some predator.
[02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:24.940]  Just because the Bible says, I saw a stranger and we took them in, that doesn't mean that
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:25.940]  we have-
[02:49:25.940 --> 02:49:30.360]  Well, the point is, it's globalism, it's pure U.N., ecumenical take-down of America and
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:33.540]  it's all moving now.
[02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:35.100]  And it should be an alarm bell.
[02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:39.940]  If your church is telling you, you shouldn't own guns, ask why the government has guns.
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:41.100]  We're supposed to be the government.
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:42.700]  You say render unto Caesar.
[02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:43.820]  We are the government.
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:45.620]  The Bill of Rights is the government.
[02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:46.740]  That's what you follow.
[02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:50.260]  That's the biblical law, not the law of the satanic U.N.
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:51.500]  Pastor Baldwin?
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.500]  Yeah, it's-
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:55.700]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:50:00.620]  This is an issue that I'm just really passionate about right now, because I think this is the
[02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:06.020]  defining issue for the future liberty and freedom of our country.
[02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:13.060]  The semi-automatic rifle is the most efficient, the most effective self-defense tool in modern
[02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:14.060]  time.
[02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:16.860]  It is equivalent to the Roman sword of the first century.
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:23.340]  Jesus commanded the disciples to buy the Roman sword and to possess the Roman sword.
[02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:28.380]  I would remind people that back in the Old Testament in Genesis 14, back before the law
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:35.060]  of Moses or anything of that nature, when Lot was taken by five heathen kings, he armed
[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:38.900]  his servants, he, Abram, they went after them.
[02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:42.140]  They took them to the battlefield.
[02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:43.380]  They fought.
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:44.900]  He slaughtered the kings.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:48.900]  He rescued Lot by the power of the sword.
[02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:57.100]  The ability to defend oneself is a fundamental natural law principle that is given by God,
[02:50:57.100 --> 02:51:02.060]  whether we're Christian or non-Christian, no matter what our denomination or lack thereof.
[02:51:02.060 --> 02:51:04.860]  The righteous self-defense is sacrosanct.
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:09.820]  It is sacrosanct, absolutely, and it is given by God.
[02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:15.940]  And for preachers to acquiesce on this issue is absolutely, in my opinion, blasphemous
[02:51:15.940 --> 02:51:17.900]  against the laws of God.
[02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:24.140]  And unfortunately, Greg, I think you'd admit with me that there are many of our brethren
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:30.740]  in the fundamentalist ranks that have capitulated on this issue, just as evangelicals have.
[02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:34.140]  Well, I haven't heard any of our unregistered church preachers.
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:38.180]  Oh yeah, no, maybe not those guys, no, not those unregistered guys.
[02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:39.560]  I'm sure they haven't.
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:43.300]  But there's a lot of guys that would call themselves fundamentalists that teach this
[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:48.800]  asinine interpretation of Romans 13, that no matter what the government declares, that
[02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:50.140]  you are to submit.
[02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:52.500]  And I've known some of these guys personally.
[02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:58.420]  Well, I would say that I'd call them, I'm putting them over the evangelical camp.
[02:51:58.420 --> 02:52:05.460]  Well, just to be clear here across the board, guys, undoubtedly, what do you call this massive
[02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:10.200]  explosion of evil, moving on all fronts, swarming us?
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:16.540]  What do you call that in history and biblically, what we're going into, a quickening, an acceleration?
[02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:23.400]  Jesus said that in the last days, many, many will fall away.
[02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:27.900]  And we're living in that day that many, many are falling away.
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:29.620]  This is the great falling away.
[02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:33.100]  That day will not come until there come a falling away first.
[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:35.540]  And that's exactly what we're seeing.
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:45.140]  Well, I think we're also seeing the age old principle of self-promotion.
[02:52:45.140 --> 02:52:49.780]  The idea that I am going to get ahead, I'm going to be prospered.
[02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:52.780]  I'm not going to endanger myself.
[02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:54.580]  I'm not going to risk anything.
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:59.860]  I think that's innate in many people that they don't want to risk.
[02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:02.000]  They don't want to endanger themselves.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:05.660]  Don't they know fortune favors the bold, and I mean, our fortune is liberty?
[02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:08.580]  Yeah, well, no, they don't.
[02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:15.700]  For so long, they have been taught and indoctrinated in this principle of submission to government.
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:19.260]  This has been going on for nearly 100 years.
[02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:24.580]  You got to go back to the war between the states, probably, before you found preachers
[02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:26.740]  that were really talking about this.
[02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:29.640]  Since then, the preachers haven't been talking about this.
[02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:33.740]  That's the opposite, Alex, they've been talking about submit to the government.
[02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:35.040]  The government is good.
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:36.620]  The government is of God.
[02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:38.300]  Don't resist.
[02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:42.580]  This has been indoctrinated in them for 150 years, probably.
[02:53:42.580 --> 02:53:46.020]  Well, look, I'm not on some high horse because I'm not a preacher and I'm not perfect, but
[02:53:46.020 --> 02:53:51.020]  I have a relationship with God and I love innocent people, I want to protect them.
[02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:54.740]  I don't know how you couldn't have burning in your bones to resist what's happening.
[02:53:54.740 --> 02:54:00.620]  And I don't know how these preachers can actually be saved Christians and sit there and promote
[02:54:00.620 --> 02:54:01.620]  all this evil.
[02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:03.820]  Pastor Dixon, what do you say to that?
[02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:11.220]  Well, all I can say is that I'm not going to say that they're not saved, but I'm going
[02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:13.980]  to say they're sure they're sure deceived.
[02:54:13.980 --> 02:54:19.340]  And the Bible says that deceived and being deceived and I'll guarantee you they need
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:23.300]  to get back and take a new look at what the scriptures teach.
[02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:29.980]  But I think it's just a total misunderstanding of the whole purpose of the Christian life.
[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:34.660]  And the Bible says, resist the devil and he'll flee from you.
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:41.020]  And Paul the apostle said, you have not yet resisted under blood and that we're to resist
[02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:42.980]  even unto blood.
[02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:45.540]  That's what Paul the apostle said.
[02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:50.340]  And we're to resist with everything that was that is within us.
[02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:52.280]  And we've just become so soft.
[02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:54.060]  We have everything is so soft.
[02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:57.820]  Sure, the Bible doesn't say lick the devil's boots and he'll flee from you.
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:54:58.820]  That's right.
[02:54:58.820 --> 02:54:59.820]  That's right.
[02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:04.620]  And everything is so soft today.
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:07.260]  We have such soft lives.
[02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:08.260]  Soft men.
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:09.260]  Men are soft.
[02:55:09.260 --> 02:55:10.260]  That's right.
[02:55:10.260 --> 02:55:17.220]  And we've become so feminized as men and we've we've just we've we're enjoying we're at ease
[02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:18.220]  in Zion.
[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:19.980]  That's that's what the Bible says.
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:27.620]  It says we're at ease in Zion and the scripture says that Ephraim turned back in the days
[02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:28.620]  of battle.
[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:29.620]  And that's where we are.
[02:55:29.620 --> 02:55:31.020]  Well, I'm not at ease.
[02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.020]  I'm not at ease.
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:36.860]  I mean, I just I don't know how anybody can be at ease when the pure evil's rising all
[02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:37.860]  around us.
[02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:44.500]  Well, Alex, let's remember to let's focus again on the importance of standing for the
[02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:45.500]  Second Amendment.
[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:47.660]  I just can't stress this enough.
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:48.660]  Oh, yeah.
[02:55:48.660 --> 02:55:49.660]  They get that.
[02:55:49.660 --> 02:55:55.740]  But we we must draw our line in the sand on this issue.
[02:55:55.740 --> 02:56:01.220]  I mean, I have publicly said and I've publicly written you've read my stuff and you see what
[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:10.660]  I am willing to be a law breaker when they tell me that my semiautomatic rifle is against
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:11.660]  the law.
[02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:14.220]  I am willing to be a law breaker.
[02:56:14.220 --> 02:56:16.980]  I will not submit to that law.
[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:19.740]  I will not register my rifles.
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:21.900]  I will not surrender my rifle.
[02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:23.260]  That's why they hate Heston so much.
[02:56:23.260 --> 02:56:24.900]  He said from my cold, dead hand.
[02:56:24.900 --> 02:56:27.660]  It's that not submitting because they always want a little more, a little more.
[02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:30.000]  We said no, no more.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:31.940]  You will not pass.
[02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:36.860]  That's why again, I have to say that's why Tim and I wrote the book to keep or not to
[02:56:36.860 --> 02:56:40.020]  keep why Christians should not give up their guns.
[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:48.280]  If we do not take a stand as a church on the issue of the right to keep and bear arms and
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:55.820]  preach it from a biblical natural law perspective, make people understand that they are morally
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:57.160]  justified.
[02:56:57.160 --> 02:57:03.500]  They are spiritually justified in violating any law that requires them to surrender their
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:04.500]  guns.
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:11.620]  If we don't take that stand and draw that line now, there is no liberty left in America.
[02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:12.620]  I cannot stress that.
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.380]  No, and I want to state something.
[02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:18.140]  It's so immoral because we know they want the guns to enslave us.
[02:57:18.140 --> 02:57:22.220]  We know they're authoritarian, so you are aiding and abetting the enemy in what they're
[02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.400]  going to do.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:28.120]  And that's why anyone that promotes it knowingly, like these police chiefs and stuff that know,
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:30.660]  they are active collaborators with the enemy.
[02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:34.160]  They are globalist operatives, and we know who runs the New World Order.
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:37.840]  They are agents of Satan, and that's not a verbal flourish.
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:41.340]  These people are agents consciously of the devil.
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:42.340]  Go ahead.
[02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:48.060]  Well, I appreciate what you're saying, but what you have to understand is, and this may
[02:57:48.060 --> 02:57:55.500]  sound Pollyanna, but the First Amendment was written before the Second Amendment.
[02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:57.740]  No, I know they have the right.
[02:57:57.740 --> 02:58:00.180]  I'm saying they want our guns to devour us.
[02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:05.660]  I appreciate what you're saying, but I want you to hear me for just a moment.
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:15.020]  We gave up the First Amendment, now we didn't, the church, the Bible says judgment must begin
[02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:16.500]  at the house of God.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:17.500]  That's right.
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:25.140]  And the preachers gave up the First Amendment, and if we weren't willing to fight for the
[02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:30.300]  First Amendment, why do you think they're going to be willing to fight for the Second
[02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:31.300]  Amendment?
[02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:32.300]  That's right.
[02:58:32.300 --> 02:58:33.620]  I'm going to fight for the Second Amendment, and I know there's a lot of others that are
[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:34.620]  as well.
[02:58:34.620 --> 02:58:36.820]  Five minutes of overdrive, gentlemen.
[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:37.820]  Back in 60 seconds.

[02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:05.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.980 --> 03:00:10.820]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.820 --> 03:00:11.820]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:13.980]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.980 --> 03:00:18.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.180 --> 03:00:23.260]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:31.740]  Look, I got in Piers Morgan's face, made a lot of little people uncomfortable out there
[03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:35.500]  because they want to be in a trance, but it's now been seen as a seminal moment in television
[03:00:35.500 --> 03:00:37.600]  by many people.
[03:00:37.600 --> 03:00:40.440]  And it's because I simply got in his face and said, I know you're coming to take my
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:41.840]  guns to enslave me.
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:45.900]  Now it turns out the article's up at infoawars.com.
[03:00:45.900 --> 03:00:48.500]  We've got them coming on Sunday.
[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:52.780]  The Veritas project, they went to his house, and he's got armed security guards.
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:54.700]  Okay, so there you go.
[03:00:54.700 --> 03:00:58.340]  That is the individual at CNN, Piers Morgan.
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:01:00.660]  They want our guns consciously to enslave us.
[03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:05.540]  And you got the state rep out in Colorado who says, well, we gotta ban 15-round mags
[03:01:05.540 --> 03:01:07.900]  cuz after you've used the mag, you throw it away.
[03:01:07.900 --> 03:01:10.860]  I mean, there's also a lot of useful idiots in this.
[03:01:10.860 --> 03:01:12.580]  So yeah, we shouldn't judge them all.
[03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:13.580]  I judge their actions.
[03:01:13.580 --> 03:01:15.060]  I don't judge them.
[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:16.700]  I don't enjoy hating the New World Order.
[03:01:16.700 --> 03:01:17.900]  I hate what they're doing.
[03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:22.140]  I want to give Pastor Dixon two minutes to finish up and then the last word to Pastor
[03:01:22.140 --> 03:01:27.420]  Chuck Baldwin, chuckbaldwinlive.com, biblicallawcenter.com for Greg Dixon.
[03:01:27.420 --> 03:01:29.340]  Greg, two minutes.
[03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:34.380]  Well, I appreciate what Chuck said, and I'm not talking about him.
[03:01:34.380 --> 03:01:43.900]  I just want to reiterate what we were saying that preachers, I'm talking about the preachers.
[03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:50.180]  If they're not willing to take a stand on the First Amendment and fight for God and
[03:01:50.180 --> 03:01:56.860]  the right to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ unfettered, free from government,
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:02:00.500]  why in the world do we think that they would be willing to fight for the Second Amendment?
[03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:02.660]  That's the point that I'm trying to make.
[03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:14.580]  And once again, I rejoice that there are still programs like this one and we need to support
[03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:20.380]  Alex Jones and we need to stand and give thanks to the Lord that we still have freedom of
[03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:27.140]  the press in this country, that we still have programs of this kind, conservative broadcast,
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:28.860]  conservative television.
[03:02:28.860 --> 03:02:36.660]  I trust that you go to our website, thebiblicallawcenter.com.
[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:41.780]  I'd like for you to get my book, The Trail of Blood Revisited, how to be free, getting
[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:43.580]  free from 501c3.
[03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:47.460]  Yeah, we need to carry that book because I've read excerpts and I'm going to read the whole
[03:02:47.460 --> 03:02:51.900]  thing I want to get you back on in the next month for a full hour on breaking the bonds
[03:02:51.900 --> 03:02:53.220]  of enslavement over the churches.
[03:02:53.220 --> 03:02:54.700]  We'll talk to you very soon.
[03:02:54.700 --> 03:02:56.940]  Thanks for all the time, Pastor Dixon.
[03:02:56.940 --> 03:02:57.940]  Thank you very much.
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:02:58.940]  You bet.
[03:02:58.940 --> 03:03:03.540]  Had the biggest church in the country and found out about all this, did the right thing
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:05.940]  and is now trying to bring the church out of bondage.
[03:03:05.940 --> 03:03:08.740]  And again, even if you don't believe in God, folks, when the government takes over the
[03:03:08.740 --> 03:03:10.020]  church, you're in trouble.
[03:03:10.020 --> 03:03:11.460]  Final comments to Chuck Baldwin.
[03:03:11.460 --> 03:03:12.460]  Pastor Baldwin.
[03:03:12.460 --> 03:03:14.320]  Yeah, Alex, thanks a lot.
[03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:16.940]  And Greg's a great man and I appreciate you having him on.
[03:03:16.940 --> 03:03:21.940]  Yeah, I just think it's absolutely critical that we, regardless of whether we call ourselves
[03:03:21.940 --> 03:03:28.340]  Christians or not, whether we go to church or not, that we understand the moral biblical
[03:03:28.340 --> 03:03:36.300]  principles that undergirding the Second Amendment, that the battle is being waged right now over
[03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:38.720]  the right to keep and bear arms.
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:41.420]  This is where the battle is raging.
[03:03:41.420 --> 03:03:45.060]  We must not capitulate, compromise or surrender this issue.
[03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:49.860]  If we do, there is no more freedom of any kind left in the United States.
[03:03:49.860 --> 03:03:55.340]  And a lot of times, I'm finding that many unsaved, unchurched people are more willing
[03:03:55.340 --> 03:03:59.700]  to stand for the Second Amendment than many of my Christian brethren.
[03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:01.540]  And I find that really disconcerting.
[03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:08.320]  It's because they've got instincts, they've got gut and they're good people who probably
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:10.300]  deep down love God.
[03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:11.300]  Absolutely right.
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:12.300]  God-fearing people.
[03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:17.420]  I hear in our fellowship in the Flathead Valley of Montana, Liberty Fellowship that I started
[03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:18.940]  a couple of years ago.
[03:04:18.940 --> 03:04:23.220]  We have people of all types that come to our fellowship.
[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:28.220]  Some don't even profess to be Christian, but they appreciate the biblically-based principles
[03:04:28.220 --> 03:04:36.020]  of liberty that we preach every Sunday afternoon from our pulpit that's live streamed at LibertyFellowshipMontana.com.
[03:04:36.020 --> 03:04:41.020]  So I'm finding people of all kinds and all shapes and sizes that are willing to stand
[03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:42.780]  and I'm very encouraged by that.
[03:04:42.780 --> 03:04:47.460]  What I'm not encouraged about is people like Franklin Graham and Richard Land and so many
[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:52.780]  of these other preachers across America that are not willing to stand up in their pulpits
[03:04:52.780 --> 03:04:54.220]  for the Second Amendment.
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:58.540]  So I encourage people, if they're attending a church where the pastor is not standing
[03:04:58.540 --> 03:04:59.820]  up for the Second Amendment...
