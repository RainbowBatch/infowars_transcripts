[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:42.000]  This is gonna be another incredibly important jam-packed transmission, so please strap yourselves
[00:42.000 --> 00:52.680]  in. It is Thursday, the 20th day of June, 2013. Now, tomorrow, I was gonna take off
[00:52.680 --> 00:56.040]  on the radio broadcast and have David Knight sit in because he does a great job with a
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.400]  bunch of important, informative guests, and he's still doing that tomorrow. Because I'm
[01:01.400 --> 01:06.320]  having to take off some days, quite frankly, just to get Obama Deception 2 codified and
[01:06.320 --> 01:12.480]  rolling and done. It's gonna blow away the first installment of it, the film seen over
[01:12.480 --> 01:17.760]  40 million times online for free. I mean, I really wanna go after the establishment
[01:17.760 --> 01:25.840]  with this one. And then right in our lap falls a huge, huge movie star who's not normally
[01:25.840 --> 01:32.440]  politically outspoken. I'll just leave it at that. Bigger than Charlie Sheen, just to
[01:32.440 --> 01:35.920]  put it to you that way. So that's either gonna happen today or tomorrow. And if they want
[01:35.920 --> 01:39.760]  it tomorrow, I'm just gonna stay like it is and let Knight do the interview.
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.160]  But again, we don't really chase movie stars around here. It's just that when they are
[01:44.160 --> 01:48.400]  politically exposing things, things that are important, especially when they don't do a
[01:48.400 --> 01:55.840]  lot of that, it is certainly something that piques the interest a bit. I get a couple
[01:55.840 --> 02:00.000]  of butterflies thinking about it. Of course, I get butterflies when I see one of our articles
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.160]  linked up on drudgereport.com. And Drudge has linked, this is obviously very important
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.060]  to one of the main Russian ministers calling for a UN-run Internet kill switch.
[02:11.060 --> 02:17.840]  So that is all coming up today. Speaking of David Knight, in the next segment, he's going
[02:17.840 --> 02:30.420]  to be in studio with us on Michael Hastings, the award-winning associate editor over at
[02:30.420 --> 02:39.540]  Rolling Stone magazine who's broken a bunch of big Pentagon stories, muckraking stories.
[02:39.540 --> 02:47.080]  His car blew up two days ago, and it blew up Tuesday. It wasn't the news till Wednesday,
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.320]  and the police instantly said no foul play, which is always suspicious.
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.640]  The engine got blown down the road. Witnesses said the car caught on fire and blew up driving
[02:56.640 --> 03:01.900]  down the street. And the police are saying the opposite, of course. I mean, they can
[03:01.900 --> 03:05.160]  gun you down now where they have assassins, and they'll say you fell and hit your head
[03:05.160 --> 03:07.920]  like Benazar Budo on tape being machine gun.
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.300]  And they said she hit her head, and there's footage of her, was in the fire, just being
[03:11.300 --> 03:17.400]  sprayed with bullets. And they're like, she bumped her head. I guess Kennedy bumped his
[03:17.400 --> 03:25.080]  head 50 years ago in Dealey Plaza. Or a gnat, a gnat flew over, it was a convertible, and
[03:25.080 --> 03:27.360]  hit him in the head and blew his head off.
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.060]  And if you don't believe that, you're a conspiracy theorist. I mean, nowadays they would just
[03:31.060 --> 03:38.320]  say, the president hit his head today, boom, head blows off. The car, boom, blows up. And
[03:38.320 --> 03:44.720]  so before it was in the main news, I was reading, okay, his car ran into a tree, he's dead.
[03:44.720 --> 03:51.960]  And I thought on air, you had to dig, the fact you had to dig, I imaged like his car
[03:51.960 --> 03:52.960]  blowing up.
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.520]  And thinking, if the car blew up or something, they might have killed him. But I go, people
[03:56.520 --> 04:03.280]  die in car wrecks. It's the number one cause of death under the age of about 55. So I said,
[04:03.280 --> 04:10.680]  maybe, maybe he just did die. And then sure enough, he had a big story on CIA corruption
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.800]  coming out. He was in contact with WikiLeaks and was about to do a big data dump.
[04:15.800 --> 04:20.700]  And the official WikiLeaks has come out and said, they talked to him one hour before his
[04:20.700 --> 04:26.480]  car blew up. And he said, the FBI is after me, they're investigating me. We've gotta
[04:26.480 --> 04:31.100]  hurry up and get this done. Well, they got you done. The FBI should have just brought
[04:31.100 --> 04:34.480]  him in for questioning and shot him in the top of the head, like they did the guy that
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.120]  knew the Zarnatt brothers.
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.880]  I mean, that's the new thing. No judge, no jury, the FBI comes to talk to you, you shoot
[04:42.880 --> 04:49.760]  yourself in the top of the head. Bada beep, bada boop, you know. What happened to Michael
[04:49.760 --> 04:56.360]  Hastings? You won't see him no more. His car blew up. But the police say no foul play,
[04:56.360 --> 05:02.380]  kind of like when they torch Dorner's cabin. Are we choosing our own destiny or has it
[05:02.380 --> 05:07.520]  been pre-selected for us? As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand
[05:07.520 --> 05:13.740]  the potential of information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly
[05:13.740 --> 05:20.520]  looking at how to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state education to the Hollywood
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.880]  media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape
[05:25.880 --> 05:30.560]  our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it
[05:30.560 --> 05:34.560]  out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.240]  happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the opinion of the
[05:39.240 --> 05:44.880]  American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war. Oh, there's another
[05:44.880 --> 05:50.360]  one, another plane just hit. State of Mind, because there's a war on for your mind. Get

[08:11.880 --> 08:30.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.480]  Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm Central, we're here live back weeknight, 7 o'clock
[08:35.480 --> 08:42.020]  Central with Infowars Nightly News. Find all the details at Infowars.com forward slash
[08:42.020 --> 08:48.320]  show. Big broadcast lined up today. We're probably, well, they say it's set. I have
[08:48.320 --> 08:52.920]  a big Hollywood movie star on for about 30 minutes in the third hour getting into some
[08:52.920 --> 08:53.920]  political issues.
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.780]  That should be quite interesting. I'll just leave it at that. See if it happens. It fell
[08:57.780 --> 09:03.420]  in our lap this morning, so we'll see what unfolds on that front. Always surprises here
[09:03.420 --> 09:08.800]  on the broadcast. The Gang of Eight, the El Jefes, say they have a Senate agreement to
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.560]  bolster border security. The border is wide open, ladies and gentlemen, wide open. I've
[09:14.560 --> 09:18.920]  been down there. I've been all over it. I've been the border in California, Arizona, Texas,
[09:18.920 --> 09:20.620]  New Mexico, you name it.
[09:20.620 --> 09:24.760]  It is wide open. The illegals walk right by. The Border Patrol will just arrest a few a
[09:24.760 --> 09:30.800]  day for PR purposes. They're ordered not to stop the illegals. Obama has already legalized
[09:30.800 --> 09:34.940]  all the illegals by fiat because that's what the establishment wants to drive down wages
[09:34.940 --> 09:37.360]  and create a new voting block that's pro tyranny.
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.080]  So we're going to be getting into that situation. I think it's newsworthy that Ron Paul was
[09:42.080 --> 09:45.720]  on yesterday and said he would not vote for this bill. But Rand Paul's been making noises
[09:45.720 --> 09:51.700]  like he is. And I understand Rand Paul's a hardcore libertarian. I respect a lot of that.
[09:51.700 --> 09:55.840]  But you can't if they're all getting free welfare like Ron Paul said. It just doesn't
[09:55.840 --> 10:00.280]  work. I can't go to Mexico and get all this free stuff. So we're going to be getting into
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.820]  that.
[10:01.820 --> 10:07.760]  Huge NSA developments, huge police state developments, huge Google developments. It's all coming
[10:07.760 --> 10:17.840]  up today. And we're going to be taking your phone calls as well coming up in the second
[10:17.840 --> 10:23.680]  hour. But right now I want to talk about the NDAA and the fact that the Pentagon is on
[10:23.680 --> 10:27.900]  record and Israel and other countries are on record saying they'll kill any foreign
[10:27.900 --> 10:31.920]  national in their own country anytime they want anywhere.
[10:31.920 --> 10:38.400]  Our so-called government goes around the world violating the Geneva Convention, international
[10:38.400 --> 10:47.560]  law and our own law bombing sometimes entire buildings or whole villages just to supposedly
[10:47.560 --> 10:52.440]  get one guy that claims a terrorist while they publicly run the majority of Al-Qaeda
[10:52.440 --> 10:58.280]  worldwide. So it's a complete oxymoron.
[10:58.280 --> 11:02.880]  Our lives are seen not as cheap, but actually as garbage to be taken to the curb. And there's
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.280]  always been political assassination throughout history. And the more corrupt a nation is,
[11:07.280 --> 11:13.840]  the more assassination type garbage you're going to have going on. And the naivete of
[11:13.840 --> 11:16.600]  the public is what is allowing this to go on.
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.680]  Remember Dorner, the supposed cop who was running around shooting people in Southern
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.720]  California. Who knows if that's even true? I don't know if it's true because they lie
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.560]  so much. And they were shooting up innocent people's cars that didn't even look like white
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.000]  women and he's a black guy.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.720]  This is the type of craziness and then the police say on six different radios, we're
[11:38.720 --> 11:42.920]  gonna burn him down. Okay, burn that cabin down, bring in the fire, got it set. It's
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.960]  burning, good job, we burn him down. And then they said, we didn't say that, we did, but
[11:47.960 --> 11:49.440]  we didn't mean burning down.
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.720]  And that sets the precedent to sit there and burn somebody up in a house and say we're
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.600]  gonna burn it down. And then burn it down, and then stand back while it burns down, and
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.320]  then say we didn't burn it down. And there's so many cases, Pat Tillman says, I'm gonna
[12:06.320 --> 12:09.160]  come home and talk about how we're growing opium over here and actually run Al-Qaeda
[12:09.160 --> 12:10.160]  in the Taliban.
[12:10.160 --> 12:15.440]  It's all fake. I came over here to help my brother. I gave up a $7 million contract.
[12:15.440 --> 12:18.400]  He wrote these letters back to family. I've talked to his brother. He goes, I'm coming
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.120]  back going public. And they're like, no, you're not. Well, how do we recycle this guy? Well,
[12:22.120 --> 12:25.360]  he's claiming charged the hill fighting Al-Qaeda and we kill him.
[12:25.360 --> 12:28.440]  And they shot him and he fell down behind a rock. And they came over and in front of
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.780]  some of the rest of the squad that had Pentagon hit men inserted that they were able to then
[12:33.780 --> 12:41.900]  testify. And the coroner came out and said that Pat Tillman was murdered. The army colonel
[12:41.900 --> 12:42.900]  would not lie.
[12:42.900 --> 12:50.960]  He said he was shot at a few feet away with a triple burst right across the forehead.
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.800]  And they shot him and then from 100 yards away that they came up, he got upset. I'm
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.080]  Pat Tillman. They shot him again. He fell down. He said, what are you doing? And they
[12:59.080 --> 13:04.160]  came up and they executed him and that all came out.
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.480]  They executed him, but then said he died battling Al-Qaeda. They blew up 23 Navy SEALs of SEAL
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.720]  Team 6 that were in on the fake raid. No one on the ship, they've now testified, shaw the
[13:14.720 --> 13:21.240]  body of bin Laden thrown in. It's all fake, folks. Now, two of the FBI agents that arrested
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.040]  the younger of the Boston bombing patsies, they fall out of a helicopter and die.
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.600]  Four SEAL Team 6 fall out of a helicopter and die. They're killing them all. Then the
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.080]  friend of the brothers who was telling people it was all fake and staged, the FBI goes to
[13:35.080 --> 13:38.440]  question him. He says they're coming to kill me, and then they shoot him in the top of
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.440]  the head.
[13:39.440 --> 13:44.680]  And then say, we were injured. It turns out they weren't injured. They yelled at them,
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.760]  so they shot him in the top of the head. They don't even hide it now. They could come here,
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.880]  say I yelled at them. I probably will yell at them and shoot me in the top of the head.
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.880]  And folks, if they do, they murdered me, okay? And most of you know this. When I was at the
[13:57.880 --> 14:10.360]  BBC a few weeks ago, the Times of London writer, after I had debated him on air, as I'm walking
[14:10.360 --> 14:14.140]  out, I say, look, the NSA is real.
[14:14.140 --> 14:16.740]  They call my house up sometimes and tell me what I've been talking about on the phone,
[14:16.740 --> 14:21.520]  so I know it's them and they threaten me. And he goes, well, you scare people. You basically
[14:21.520 --> 14:29.720]  deserve it. I mean, there wasn't even off record a denial of all this. The Esquire writer,
[14:29.720 --> 14:34.800]  whose gab was a famous CIA section chief over South Vietnam and killed Viet Dan, this is
[14:34.800 --> 14:35.800]  all on record.
[14:35.800 --> 14:40.600]  Yeah, he told me, well, you scare the government. He's got a big probably hit piece coming out.
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.400]  We'll see. He's a famous profiler. He doesn't usually do hit pieces. Did the definitive
[14:44.400 --> 14:49.040]  Charlton Heston with him right before he died, all of it. Hundreds of big pieces. We'll see
[14:49.040 --> 14:50.420]  what happens with that.
[14:50.420 --> 14:54.960]  The point is, folks, they're assassinating my character in the media right now. They
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.600]  can do that, then they can kill me. And I'm not saying that people would Esquire even
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.800]  conscious of that or the guy with the Times of London. It's just that the attitude is
[15:04.800 --> 15:07.240]  there with the system and I'm a scary guy.
[15:07.240 --> 15:14.760]  So whatever happens, happens because the government's building a better world doing this good thing.
[15:14.760 --> 15:23.400]  Now enter the new article at infoawards.com. Evidence indicates Michael Hastings was assassinated.
[15:23.400 --> 15:30.120]  This is the associate editor of Rolling Stone, Michael Hastings. He brought down McChrystal,
[15:30.120 --> 15:36.520]  who was embedded in black ops and CIA operations in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.580]  This guy knew a lot of secrets. And he was reportedly, this is now confirmed, doing an
[15:40.580 --> 15:46.120]  in-depth expose that would blow the CIA wide open, is what he told WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.240]  said they talked to him. This is all confirmed. The official WikiLeaks, one hour before his
[15:51.240 --> 15:53.240]  car blew up driving down the road.
[15:53.240 --> 15:58.560]  And he said, the FBI is investigating me. We've got to get this story going quick here.
[15:58.560 --> 16:03.600]  He was getting info from WikiLeaks. And then his car, the witnesses, multiple witnesses
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.960]  said, was driving along and caught on fire and blew up. And the engines down the street,
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.280]  folks, you don't hit and then have the engine go past the tree down the street.
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.560]  And you have the police immediately saying no foul play. And then it didn't get any coverage
[16:15.560 --> 16:23.760]  and the media buried, took a day for them to bury. By the way, the car burned up. And
[16:23.760 --> 16:37.200]  then you think about the most decorated Navy SEAL sniper in the last 50 years. Chris Kyle
[16:37.200 --> 16:41.680]  is being sued for what's clearly a psy-op against Ventura.
[16:41.680 --> 16:46.960]  And then some windup toy comes and guns him down at a shooting range, a private shooting
[16:46.960 --> 16:53.200]  range. It's actually a resort up outside Dallas. And folks, there's so many of these deaths.
[16:53.200 --> 17:00.800]  I talked to Gary Webb, Pulitzer Prize winner, for his Dark Alliance book exposing CIA drug
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.440]  trafficking. They tried to discredit him, said he'd been exposed, none of it was true.
[17:04.440 --> 17:08.320]  He had a new book coming out, and he was gonna come on my show. I talked to him a few months
[17:08.320 --> 17:12.280]  before he died. And I've talked to his friends that talked to him weeks before. He moved
[17:12.280 --> 17:16.040]  his kids out of his house because Special Forces would break into it.
[17:16.040 --> 17:20.360]  He'd pull into home, they wanted him to see it, and they'd be sliding down the drainage
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.920]  pipes on his two-story house, digging through his house. So he moved his kids out with his
[17:24.920 --> 17:29.720]  ex-wife, moved into another place, and they came and shot him twice in the back of the
[17:29.720 --> 17:36.040]  head. And the police, again, instantly said that it was a suicide. That's what the Tell
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.800]  Tell sign, instantly. Breitbart, well, Breitbart had health issues.
[17:40.800 --> 17:46.520]  They always tailor it to look like what happened. He was at a bar with a bunch of people, folks.
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.000]  The police instantly said before one hour, 45 minutes after he was announced dead, dead
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.380]  on arrival basically at the hospital, the police said no foul play. That's always the
[17:57.380 --> 18:01.480]  Tell Tell sign, they're in on it. They've been given the order, shut this down.
[18:01.480 --> 18:04.820]  Same things with Hastings. We're gonna come back for the next couple of segments with
[18:04.820 --> 18:12.320]  an in-depth expose on this with the actual FEMA and Department of Transportation numbers
[18:12.320 --> 18:20.760]  on 2% of people die in a car fire, 2%. My dad was in a car fire with my sister, had
[18:20.760 --> 18:27.360]  a Volkswagen that the gasoline hose came off when I was in high school.
[18:27.360 --> 18:30.600]  Big fire in the back, they got out, car burnt completely down before the fire department
[18:30.600 --> 18:40.320]  got there. 2%, 98% of people don't get killed in a car fire. And his car, again, they said
[18:40.320 --> 18:44.120]  hit a tree and then caught on fire. The witnesses say, drive down the road and explodes into
[18:44.120 --> 18:45.120]  flames.
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.720]  When you really wanna get rid of evidence, ladies and gentlemen, they've got little chip
[18:50.720 --> 18:54.620]  computer programs. They can slap right on a car that will then remote control them with
[18:54.620 --> 18:58.840]  their electronic system with the cars made in the last decade. This is how the CIA does
[18:58.840 --> 19:00.260]  it. This has been declassified.
[19:00.260 --> 19:05.640]  They put you in a car and then remote control it and then blow it up to get rid of the fact
[19:05.640 --> 19:12.280]  they already killed you. Because people survive car bombs sometimes as well. And it's not
[19:12.280 --> 19:16.120]  shaped just right. That's why they also, even if he was alive, like to go with explosive
[19:16.120 --> 19:23.460]  fire bombs, because they also tend to burn the person up.
[19:23.460 --> 19:31.280]  And I would give it, my gut is 98% chance they killed him, 98% chance. And again, yesterday
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.880]  I said, we don't know, managed out in a car wreck. And then sure enough, he's coming out
[19:35.880 --> 19:36.880]  with a big story on the CIA.
[19:36.880 --> 19:40.640]  He tells WikiLeaks that basically the FBI is after him. Why didn't the FBI just go to
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.520]  his house, tie him up, shoot him in the top of the head like they normally do? That's
[19:44.520 --> 19:50.440]  all it is, is the mafia. We have a mafia government in this country right now. And you better
[19:50.440 --> 19:54.520]  be praying for info wars and yours truly. Cause let me tell you something, they've had
[19:54.520 --> 19:59.840]  many discussions about killing me. You can absolutely bet your bottom dollar. We'll be
[19:59.840 --> 20:00.840]  right back.

[21:41.980 --> 21:45.380]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than

[24:08.860 --> 24:13.820]  Alex Jones here back live. We're going to get into a special report now, the evidence
[24:13.820 --> 24:18.460]  that Michael Hastings was killed. And now the media will go along when they burn down
[24:18.460 --> 24:21.940]  a cabin with somebody in it. When they shoot somebody in the top of the head during questioning
[24:21.940 --> 24:25.380]  at their house, it's not being questioned.
[24:25.380 --> 24:28.580]  And that's when you go into a real tyranny. They'll start killing thousands of people.
[24:28.580 --> 24:34.240]  They'll start arresting people. And at that point, media and journalists have to start
[24:34.240 --> 24:38.860]  taking precautions to protect ourselves. And then if it goes too far, things go on the
[24:38.860 --> 24:44.220]  offense. That's the only way to stop things like this. And they want to start a war. They
[24:44.220 --> 24:45.900]  want to have a secret war against journalists.
[24:45.900 --> 24:53.460]  They've been having one with the whistleblowers, all of it. I mean, if they kill me, folks,
[24:53.460 --> 25:01.820]  you know who did it and you know what to do. Just gonna leave it at that. Now, David Knight,
[25:01.820 --> 25:05.200]  you're here with us. One main reason they haven't killed me yet and they've beat me
[25:05.200 --> 25:08.180]  up and threatened to kill me plenty of times is they know if they kill us, I have a media
[25:08.180 --> 25:09.700]  organization left behind.
[25:09.700 --> 25:13.460]  That's why you're here, buddy. I've told the crew that privately. You're here. So if they
[25:13.460 --> 25:18.180]  kill me, it continues on. And I want justice. I want reporters there. If they blow me up,
[25:18.180 --> 25:22.420]  they put me in a room with a hooker. You guys work with me, you know I don't do that stuff.
[25:22.420 --> 25:28.020]  They killed me. They killed me, period. I don't do drugs, none of it. So bottom line,
[25:28.020 --> 25:29.380]  if this happens, they killed me.
[25:29.380 --> 25:33.720]  This is so obvious. We've got newscasts. They're local, but not on the national news where
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.300]  explosion engine flies down the road. I mean, this is incredible. We're gonna get to that.
[25:37.300 --> 25:40.500]  This is a short segment. We're gonna have you in a long segment coming up, which is
[25:40.500 --> 25:46.020]  a larger subject of political assassination. But I mean, this thing absolutely stinks to
[25:46.020 --> 25:47.020]  high heaven.
[25:47.020 --> 25:50.760]  You know, last night when I was getting ready to the nightly news, I started looking at
[25:50.760 --> 25:55.300]  this and I didn't even get into why this might happen. I didn't even get into the conspiracy
[25:55.300 --> 26:00.380]  theory aspect of it. I'm just looking at this as an accident. And it made absolutely no
[26:00.380 --> 26:01.380]  sense to me.
[26:01.380 --> 26:05.860]  You know, first you hear, oh, it's a fiery crash, high speed crash. He hits into a tree
[26:05.860 --> 26:12.340]  and the car catches on fire and burns. That's the way people typically die in a fiery crash.
[26:12.340 --> 26:17.660]  They get pinned in a car that then is somehow compromised mechanically. A fire starts, they
[26:17.660 --> 26:19.660]  can't get out and they die.
[26:19.660 --> 26:23.980]  That's not what happened here. If you look at the eyewitness report, the only one they've
[26:23.980 --> 26:28.240]  got is a guy named Luis Cortez. And he says he's driving down the road, sees a car coming
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.380]  at him at high speed and it jackknifes. Now, I don't know exactly what that means because
[26:32.380 --> 26:37.240]  jackknifing is typically what you're talking about, a truck doing this, articulated semi-trailer.
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.860]  But he said jackknife and pieces flew everywhere.
[26:40.860 --> 26:42.500]  You look at the report-
[26:42.500 --> 26:43.500]  That's an explosion.
[26:43.500 --> 26:48.840]  Yeah, it's an explosion. If you look at the report from the people that were there, they
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.200]  said that it sounded like a bomb, shook their whole house, rattled their windows. And then
[26:53.200 --> 26:57.820]  another guy points to the engine that he said flew 50 to 60 yards down from the point that
[26:57.820 --> 27:03.480]  it had stopped. And it makes absolutely no sense that an engine is going to fly out of
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.180]  a car at a right angle to the point that it's going when it hits a tree.
[27:08.180 --> 27:11.860]  Then if you look carefully at the pictures, you see that the car is not really crashed.
[27:11.860 --> 27:13.700]  It's came to rest up against the tree.
[27:13.700 --> 27:16.060]  Yeah, it's not even really run into the tree. It's up against it.
[27:16.060 --> 27:18.060]  Yeah, it's up against it. It's kind of beside it. You can actually-
[27:18.060 --> 27:20.420]  You can see the car's exploded. The engine's flown down the road.
[27:20.420 --> 27:24.580]  And you can see the nose, what's left of the frame of the car sticking out beyond the tree.
[27:24.580 --> 27:27.700]  So it's kind of like it's beside the tree after the fire is out. You can see this in
[27:27.700 --> 27:32.360]  this picture from the LA Times. And the nose of the car appears to be sticking out from
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.940]  beyond the tree. The fire seems to be concentrated around the passenger area. But there's absolutely
[27:37.940 --> 27:41.500]  no way that the car's going to veer off to the left or to the right.
[27:41.500 --> 27:42.500]  And-
[27:42.500 --> 27:45.300]  Well, I've seen 100 photos of car bombs. That's what they look like.
[27:45.300 --> 27:50.220]  Right, absolutely. Absolutely. There's a tremendous impact there. But the car was not compromised,
[27:50.220 --> 27:54.940]  as you would expect, what hits a tree. And the fact that the engine flew down the road,
[27:54.940 --> 27:59.280]  and the fact that this one person who saw it said the pieces went everywhere. I mean,
[27:59.280 --> 28:03.580]  that tells you that it blew up while it was going down the road. It did not hit a tree,
[28:03.580 --> 28:05.340]  catch on fire, and then-
[28:05.340 --> 28:08.420]  We're going to get more into this and get into the statistics. But tell people about
[28:08.420 --> 28:09.420]  this clip.
[28:09.420 --> 28:13.860]  Oh, this clip, this is from the nightly news. So we had this last night. It was a local
[28:13.860 --> 28:19.140]  news story that had this on there. And you'll hear the eyewitness's reports on here. Let's
[28:19.140 --> 28:21.340]  take a look at that clip.
[28:21.340 --> 28:25.560]  Rolling Stone magazine called Michael Hastings a fearless journalist who refused to cozy
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.820]  up to power. His death at 33 came by way of a fire fueled and explosive crash.
[28:30.820 --> 28:36.400]  It sounded like a bomb went off in the middle of the night. My house shook. The windows
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  were rattling.
[28:37.400 --> 28:38.400]  Oh.
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.100]  Wouldn't have written a scene like this for a movie where the engine flies from the car,
[28:42.100 --> 28:49.100]  which was about, I don't know, 50, 60 yards up, right down here to this telephone pole.
[28:49.100 --> 28:54.340]  Unbelievable. And in the national news, it's no foul play, ran into a tree. They blew that
[28:54.340 --> 28:57.780]  car up. Maybe we should say a car crashed into the Oklahoma City building.
[28:57.780 --> 28:58.780]  Yeah.
[28:58.780 --> 28:59.780]  A car did.
[28:59.780 --> 29:03.460]  Well, and when you look at that picture, the car, the engine doesn't look like it's on
[29:03.460 --> 29:04.460]  fire, right?
[29:04.460 --> 29:05.800]  No, it's been blown out.
[29:05.800 --> 29:08.700]  It's been blown out. And it looks like it's going back part of the transmission there.
[29:08.700 --> 29:09.700]  You see the alternator-
[29:09.700 --> 29:12.680]  Well, you're an engineer, but you notice it's all aiming back from his trajectory being
[29:12.680 --> 29:13.680]  blown out.
[29:13.680 --> 29:17.460]  Well, you're not going to send the engine down the road at a right angle to the point
[29:17.460 --> 29:20.900]  at which it hits a tree, even if it hit the tree. But when you look at the pictures again,
[29:20.900 --> 29:24.980]  you don't see the body being smashed up against the tree. And so when we looked at this last
[29:24.980 --> 29:25.980]  night-
[29:25.980 --> 29:29.020]  It puts a bomb in the dash. You can see it right there. So it blew back towards him and
[29:29.020 --> 29:30.220]  blew the engine out the front.
[29:30.220 --> 29:31.220]  That's right.
[29:31.220 --> 29:32.940]  Then the car flipped down the road up against the tree.
[29:32.940 --> 29:33.940]  That's right. Absolutely.
[29:33.940 --> 29:38.420]  Man, I tell you folks, they could just blow me up and just say, oh, fire. Everybody could
[29:38.420 --> 29:43.140]  be like, oh, it blew up. You know, there's an engine 50 yards down the road. No big deal.
[29:43.140 --> 29:47.020]  Nothing to worry about, Mr. Gover. Just a plastic explosive. We'll be, we're going to
[29:47.020 --> 29:49.660]  have a little catty shack there. This is really scary, folks.

[33:08.420 --> 33:28.460]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.460 --> 33:32.900]  David Knight is our guest in studio. I'm Alex Jones. Again, David is an InfoWars Nightly
[33:32.900 --> 33:39.540]  News reporter, an engineer and he's also an investigative reporting in North Carolina.
[33:39.540 --> 33:42.340]  And now, of course, he's been here with the InfoWars team, what is it, six, seven, eight
[33:42.340 --> 33:43.340]  months now?
[33:43.340 --> 33:44.340]  About eight.
[33:44.340 --> 33:45.340]  Yeah, you're doing a great job, man.
[33:45.340 --> 33:46.340]  Thank you.
[33:46.340 --> 33:51.020]  Seriously, when I talk about people know what to do if they start rounding us up, disappearing
[33:51.020 --> 33:58.940]  us, I have worked as hard as I can to be nonviolent. I have done everything I can and if they kill
[33:58.940 --> 34:05.100]  me, I don't want people to just go out and randomly be violent. I want you to aggressively
[34:05.100 --> 34:07.260]  get the word out cuz I'm not afraid to die.
[34:07.260 --> 34:11.700]  I'm afraid of these people running the world because once you get into a mafia culture,
[34:11.700 --> 34:16.980]  it just starts taking over and expanding until there's no society and you collapse like all
[34:16.980 --> 34:20.960]  those third world countries. And then the argument is, well, even if you're not a bad
[34:20.960 --> 34:25.740]  person work with the evil cuz you'll have a better lot in life.
[34:25.740 --> 34:32.960]  It's the disease of our civilization. And obviously, if they start disappearing people
[34:32.960 --> 34:36.420]  in the night, Alexander Shultz and eats and talked about it, how they burned in the camps
[34:36.420 --> 34:40.100]  later wishing they would have done something. I don't think we've gotten to that point yet,
[34:40.100 --> 34:42.180]  but we need to have a real debate.
[34:42.180 --> 34:48.000]  Not just about NSA spying and persecuting the Tea Party with the IRS and persecuting
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.640]  pro-life groups who stand up for little babies. Look how evil these mafia people are, that's
[34:53.640 --> 35:03.180]  all it is, we're being muscled. They are killing people, and David Knight covered it last night.
[35:03.180 --> 35:06.860]  Authors come out with the history, and the New American Magazine wrote about it, about
[35:06.860 --> 35:10.500]  how the Pentagon admits their main tool now is assassination.
[35:10.500 --> 35:16.060]  Well, it's been like that for at least 60, 70 years. I mean, I know a lot of army officers,
[35:16.060 --> 35:26.420]  Texans, who were in secret assassination groups here in the US. And it's not like the people
[35:26.420 --> 35:32.100]  I know are something special, ladies and gentlemen, it's giant. Do you understand that? And they
[35:32.100 --> 35:38.820]  have got, let's be conservative, more than 10,000, I would guess, to make current domestic
[35:38.820 --> 35:43.180]  assassins that are Army, Navy, you name it.
[35:43.180 --> 35:47.180]  When you become a Navy SEAL, or Green Beret, or any of this stuff, or even Delta Force,
[35:47.180 --> 35:52.580]  then there's levels above that, okay? And those levels are called the dark side, and
[35:52.580 --> 35:58.700]  it's the narcotics, it's all of it going on. And these are like made men, I don't know
[35:58.700 --> 36:01.220]  if you can tell the story about your Navy SEAL friend, you were just telling me, you
[36:01.220 --> 36:02.220]  don't wanna tell it?
[36:02.220 --> 36:03.220]  No.
[36:03.220 --> 36:09.900]  But I mean, these guys, it's disgusting, it's not cool, it's not tough, and they kill each
[36:09.900 --> 36:14.420]  other too. I mean, no doubt they did a hit on Chris Kyle. No doubt, all this stuff's
[36:14.420 --> 36:18.220]  going on, they will flush you down the toilet in a minute. Remember, hundreds of thousands
[36:18.220 --> 36:21.740]  of Gulf War troops got the Gulf War illness, at least 50,000 have died in the 20 years
[36:21.740 --> 36:22.740]  since.
[36:22.740 --> 36:26.980]  They knew when they detonated those 200 plus chemical dumps, that it was all gonna rain
[36:26.980 --> 36:31.740]  down and soft kill people. And that's now confirmed for 20 years, the brain stems, it's
[36:31.740 --> 36:38.700]  back on the New York Times last Friday. Again, there's no honor in this, and it's cowardly
[36:38.700 --> 36:42.820]  to blow up this journalist. I know he lied to McChrystal and said it was gonna be a puff
[36:42.820 --> 36:43.820]  piece.
[36:43.820 --> 36:46.620]  And in their mafia rules, let me tell you, I would not be led in by the Pentagon to something
[36:46.620 --> 36:51.100]  and lie to them. If I told somebody, I'm not gonna expose any of your confidences, cuz
[36:51.100 --> 36:56.420]  reportedly that's what he did. Cuz I mean, it's not just that, I don't tell people I'm
[36:56.420 --> 36:58.620]  gonna do something and then not do it.
[36:58.620 --> 37:01.780]  I'll tell the globalists I'm gonna try to bring them down. I'll tell them I'm coming
[37:01.780 --> 37:07.180]  for them. In these mafia rules, this is how they operate. I'm telling you, you mess with
[37:07.180 --> 37:11.140]  their families or you work with them and then lie to them. And that's what Hastings did,
[37:11.140 --> 37:12.140]  your free game.
[37:12.140 --> 37:16.740]  Now, I'm not saying it's good they blew him up. But it's another issue here, if they can
[37:16.740 --> 37:20.620]  burn down somebody in a cabin, say they did it, and then not get in trouble. And they
[37:20.620 --> 37:26.660]  can say that they're gonna kill people and blow them up. And people see a bomb go off
[37:26.660 --> 37:32.400]  and kill Pat Tillman, and then kill five members of Private Lynch's unit who said that she
[37:32.400 --> 37:33.400]  was cowering in fear.
[37:33.400 --> 37:37.700]  They went out and killed them. And I told Lynch through channels, I said, you better
[37:37.700 --> 37:41.720]  go public and say it was all a lie. They'll kill you next, like Pat Tillman. She went
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.000]  public and said it was all a lie. That's the only reason she's still alive, folks. This
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.140]  is how they operate, you mean nothing to them, okay?
[37:50.140 --> 37:54.880]  Now you've got the floor, break all this down, go over the history of it, what we're facing,
[37:54.880 --> 37:55.880]  and then that-
[37:55.880 --> 37:59.620]  Well, Alex, like you were just talking about the LA police, what they said in the case
[37:59.620 --> 38:04.260]  with Chris Dorner. And how they were caught even, you could hear the transcripts, the
[38:04.260 --> 38:08.020]  audio of the police talking to each other saying, burn it down. They still denied that
[38:08.020 --> 38:09.020]  they burned it down.
[38:09.020 --> 38:12.940]  In this particular incident, we've got the LA police department, same police department
[38:12.940 --> 38:16.940]  saying, the engine's location is evidence that the driver was, quote, hauling Irish
[38:16.940 --> 38:21.020]  ass and lost control, unquote. And with the engine torn off, the gas lines would rupture
[38:21.020 --> 38:25.500]  and it would start a fire. Now, the engine's not gonna go flying, no matter how fast you
[38:25.500 --> 38:28.660]  go on a new Mercedes, the engine and parts are not gonna go flying-
[38:28.660 --> 38:29.660]  It's bolted in.
[38:29.660 --> 38:34.080]  Right, yeah, I mean, this is not some old rusting hulk with the engine mounts about
[38:34.080 --> 38:36.540]  to come off, this is a new Mercedes.
[38:36.540 --> 38:37.540]  And-
[38:37.540 --> 38:40.620]  Look, I flipped a truck doing 80 before and the engine didn't come out, rolled it three
[38:40.620 --> 38:41.620]  times.
[38:41.620 --> 38:45.820]  Right, and so, but they wanna say, they've got a couple of different narratives here.
[38:45.820 --> 38:49.380]  One of them is that it crashes into the tree, catches fire, but then you've got this engine
[38:49.380 --> 38:53.260]  hurled down the road. And they say, yeah, well, the engine hurled down the road is evidence
[38:53.260 --> 38:55.180]  that that's how the fire would have started.
[38:55.180 --> 38:59.140]  But you can't hurl the engine down at a right angle to the point of impact. And if the engine
[38:59.140 --> 39:02.300]  hurls down the road as he's going down the road, it's an explosion.
[39:02.300 --> 39:06.740]  You have the witnesses saying, boom, it woke them up, shook their houses.
[39:06.740 --> 39:13.020]  Right, right, this is a very rare occurrence too, as we're pointing out in FEMA, Department
[39:13.020 --> 39:15.860]  of Homeland Security, they were talking about highway vehicle fires and there's about a
[39:15.860 --> 39:20.960]  quarter of a million of them a year. Typically, nothing happens, only in about 2% of these
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.300]  do you have a fatality. Actually, the actual number is 2.6% out of every-
[39:25.300 --> 39:26.860]  Can we document, Cam, that, guys?
[39:26.860 --> 39:32.900]  Sorry, not 2.6%, it's 2.6 out of every 1,000, so it's 0.26.
[39:32.900 --> 39:35.740]  So I was wrong when I said 2%, it's 0.26.
[39:35.740 --> 39:37.740]  0.26, yeah. So that's-
[39:37.740 --> 39:39.320]  So it's less than 1%.
[39:39.320 --> 39:43.780]  Less than 1%, exactly. Of course, as Darren McBrain pointed out, the probability goes
[39:43.780 --> 39:46.780]  up if you're a journalist that they don't like. Now you were talking about-
[39:46.780 --> 39:51.020]  Yeah, they've done those studies on politicians, and not just that they fly more, they do it
[39:51.020 --> 39:55.620]  with other frequent flyers. I saw the statistic like 15 years ago, it's probably changed,
[39:55.620 --> 39:59.980]  either less or more, I don't know, where you were something like eight times more likely
[39:59.980 --> 40:04.300]  to die in a plane crash if you were a politician per capita than other frequent flyers that
[40:04.300 --> 40:05.300]  fly the same amount.
[40:05.300 --> 40:08.740]  That's right. Now, we covered this on the Nightly News last night, we didn't go into
[40:08.740 --> 40:14.420]  speculating as to who might this be, cuz he's really picked off a lot of people, from McChrystal
[40:14.420 --> 40:18.900]  to he was investigating, he had done investigative reports on the CIA, was working on one for
[40:18.900 --> 40:24.140]  the CIA. And as you pointed out, he had tweeted to Wicked Leaks that he was being followed
[40:24.140 --> 40:26.980]  by the FBI just hours before he died.
[40:26.980 --> 40:29.980]  So there were a lot of people in the government as-
[40:29.980 --> 40:34.040]  Just like cop of the year Terrence Yankee in Oklahoma City said, I got feds behind me,
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.460]  and they tortured him and killed him. Last phone call of his partner.
[40:37.460 --> 40:43.280]  And as you're talking about this assassination government that we've got going on, this book
[40:43.280 --> 40:48.020]  is Mark Mazzetti, Pulitzer Prize winning author, the name of the book is Way of the Knife.
[40:48.020 --> 40:53.220]  And what he's talking about in this is the fact that Obama is using not just the CIA,
[40:53.220 --> 40:58.660]  but he's using the military now for assassination operations that is becoming pervasive.
[40:58.660 --> 41:04.620]  And McChrystal was part of running that, McChrystal was head of the Special Operations Forces
[41:04.620 --> 41:08.820]  there, right? And McChrystal was also involved in the Pat Tillman cover up. He was the one
[41:08.820 --> 41:10.940]  who was there giving the awards and-
[41:10.940 --> 41:17.380]  Yeah, he's the main suspect, he strikes again. I forgot McChrystal ran the op and the cover
[41:17.380 --> 41:18.380]  up of Tillman.
[41:18.380 --> 41:19.380]  That's right.
[41:19.380 --> 41:20.380]  Boy.
[41:20.380 --> 41:23.900]  So you've got this situation where you've got this mass, as you pointed out, a massive
[41:23.900 --> 41:28.820]  amount of people, not just in the CIA, but now in special operations in the military.
[41:28.820 --> 41:33.300]  And you've got another author who has written an entire book about how assassination, and
[41:33.300 --> 41:36.940]  it's not just drone assassination, that's something that we look at and we say, wow,
[41:36.940 --> 41:41.500]  that's really cold. That's amazing that they're just raining death down on people from the
[41:41.500 --> 41:42.500]  air.
[41:42.500 --> 41:47.500]  That's just more visible, the invisible things that they're doing with all of these special
[41:47.500 --> 41:51.300]  operation forces and with the CIA. That, as you said, has been going on for a long time.
[41:51.300 --> 41:52.300]  But now-
[41:52.300 --> 41:53.300]  But they've just expanded it.
[41:53.300 --> 41:56.940]  They've expanded it, and they don't even try to cover it up much anymore. And you get these
[41:56.940 --> 42:02.140]  ridiculous statements from the LA Police Department with situations like Chris Dorner. And again,
[42:02.140 --> 42:04.900]  now with this car accident, it just doesn't make any sense.
[42:04.900 --> 42:09.980]  You know the LA system was the beta test. Daryl Gates, before he died, gave interviews
[42:09.980 --> 42:14.460]  that the CIA in the 60s came in as a beta test, put them in black uniforms, militarized
[42:14.460 --> 42:17.780]  them, make it sexy, spreed a core, all the other cops will want to be federalized.
[42:17.780 --> 42:19.780]  So they started the SWAT teams as an-
[42:19.780 --> 42:24.100]  SWAT teams, all of it. They started in LA, then in New York and Dallas of all places,
[42:24.100 --> 42:29.940]  then Houston, taking special ops hitmen and putting them into police departments. So that
[42:29.940 --> 42:34.020]  when they need to kill a CIA guy, like they did down in Houston a few years ago, they
[42:34.020 --> 42:39.660]  pull him over, the CIA section guy gets out, what Carney was his name, and they shoot him
[42:39.660 --> 42:42.220]  right in the head, under the helicopter.
[42:42.220 --> 42:47.080]  The guy's hands are at his side, boom, execution. And then he tracked back that cop, he was
[42:47.080 --> 42:52.340]  in black ops. So every major department has these federal hitmen on it now. And they're
[42:52.340 --> 42:56.180]  not even feds, they work for foreign banks. I mean, this country's just in so much trouble.
[42:56.180 --> 42:59.660]  And what's amazing about it is, like you said, you can get a video of it, you can get audio
[42:59.660 --> 43:03.180]  recordings of it, you can look at where the engine is, where the car is, the condition
[43:03.180 --> 43:04.180]  of the car.
[43:04.180 --> 43:05.740]  Witnesses sang and blew up?
[43:05.740 --> 43:06.740]  Yeah.
[43:06.740 --> 43:10.660]  Because I've seen cars crash outside my house, run into a tree, people have been hurt, killed.
[43:10.660 --> 43:13.940]  Everybody's seen it, you hear, it's a big noise.
[43:13.940 --> 43:14.940]  Yes.
[43:14.940 --> 43:19.980]  But it doesn't shake your house, only the explosive wave by high explosives sends that.
[43:19.980 --> 43:24.300]  Mm-hm, that's right. But even if it had been an explosion because of gas lines, the engine
[43:24.300 --> 43:27.740]  was ejected down the road, the engine is not on fire.
[43:27.740 --> 43:29.740]  Gasoline doesn't send those explosive waves though.
[43:29.740 --> 43:34.500]  That's right, you talk about a smoking gun. I mean, there's no smoking engine. I mean,
[43:34.500 --> 43:40.260]  that car was just really engulfed in flames, but the engine is down the road, not touched.
[43:40.260 --> 43:41.260]  So I mean, that-
[43:41.260 --> 43:45.420]  And the witnesses are saying it's driving down the road. I saw one where it's driving
[43:45.420 --> 43:46.420]  and bursts into flames.
[43:46.420 --> 43:49.620]  Yeah, that's what the witness says. He says, I was just coming northbound on Highland and
[43:49.620 --> 43:54.900]  I saw a car going really fast. All of a sudden, I seen it jackknife. I'd just seen parts fly
[43:54.900 --> 43:58.980]  everywhere and I slammed on my brakes and stopped and tried to call 911. That's Luis
[43:58.980 --> 44:03.100]  Cortez. That's the eye witness report, the only eye witness report because this happened
[44:03.100 --> 44:04.900]  at 4.30 in the morning.
[44:04.900 --> 44:10.580]  Now, statistically it being LA, it was probably the police that loaded the bomb. Yeah, but
[44:10.580 --> 44:13.860]  that's usually, it's kind of like a turf deal and they get their payment and that's how
[44:13.860 --> 44:14.860]  it works.
[44:14.860 --> 44:19.340]  Well, I tell you what, I mean, the LA Police Department, especially after the Dornan case,
[44:19.340 --> 44:21.940]  they just don't have any credibility-
[44:21.940 --> 44:22.940]  They're the Gambinos.
[44:22.940 --> 44:23.940]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[44:23.940 --> 44:32.020]  Look, I have had dinner with retired detectives and people that are basically with the Vikings.
[44:32.020 --> 44:36.460]  They made movies about that. It's real. And they're just like, of course, 911 is an inside
[44:36.460 --> 44:40.460]  job. Of course, they blew it up. I mean, they're like, what do you do? Everything's a mafia.
[44:40.460 --> 44:44.420]  I mean, I've been to a bunch of parties with them. I know some are famous cops. I mean,
[44:44.420 --> 44:48.000]  it's like, of course, it's all a big joke. I don't think this is cute. I don't want my
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.820]  kids growing up in a country like this.
[44:49.820 --> 44:55.260]  No, and it is really frightening that they can just do this out in the open and deny
[44:55.260 --> 44:59.420]  it. And no matter how ridiculous it is, another story that broke yesterday was the TWA Flight
[44:59.420 --> 45:04.620]  800, the new documentary coming out where they've got six investigators who were shut
[45:04.620 --> 45:06.260]  down by the FBI when this happens.
[45:06.260 --> 45:10.020]  They arrested journalists. We need to get them on who snuck in and got the samples in
[45:10.020 --> 45:13.300]  the hangar. It was an explosive continuous rod warhead.
[45:13.300 --> 45:17.580]  That's right. And in that case, you see the FBI is going out and interviewing people and
[45:17.580 --> 45:21.860]  just not putting down an official transcript, putting down a summary, not showing the summary
[45:21.860 --> 45:24.820]  even to the witnesses and say, did we get it right? I mean, they just went through a
[45:24.820 --> 45:25.820]  perfunctory event.
[45:25.820 --> 45:29.900]  There were 700 Army and Navy witnesses to the missile. They were having a drill then.
[45:29.900 --> 45:34.260]  Yeah, exactly. And you've got transcriptions of airline pilots.
[45:34.260 --> 45:37.020]  Of course, you know the plane was loaded with Egyptian military officers.
[45:37.020 --> 45:40.900]  No, I didn't know that. Yeah, I'm going to show you this.
[45:40.900 --> 45:46.020]  The rise of the killer drones, how America goes to war in secret. Michael Hastings, an
[45:46.020 --> 45:50.260]  inside look at how killing by remote control has changed the way of flight. And these are
[45:50.260 --> 45:51.260]  the articles.
[45:51.260 --> 45:56.100]  Here's a drone strike from above. See the wheels are still intact. Jeez, you and Etta
[45:56.100 --> 45:59.900]  just pointed that out. Is it possible this guy could have been hit by a drone as sort
[45:59.900 --> 46:02.700]  of a, you're writing about drones, now we're going to hit you.
[46:02.700 --> 46:03.700]  Yeah.
[46:03.700 --> 46:04.700]  McChrystal's out there.
[46:04.700 --> 46:11.820]  Yeah, that drone strike does look like that. But generally, I know it looks similar, but
[46:11.820 --> 46:16.100]  that would hammer the engine down or maybe it depends on where the missile hit.
[46:16.100 --> 46:17.100]  Right.
[46:17.100 --> 46:22.940]  I mean, it's much easier and easier to hide. Why would they go with something exotic or
[46:22.940 --> 46:27.900]  maybe they'll start having drones out in public and kill people. I mean, it's really a flaunting
[46:27.900 --> 46:34.820]  now of the psychopaths. It could be, but seeing other car bombs, the professionals put plastic
[46:34.820 --> 46:39.540]  explosives and a lot of times with an accelerant and with something that's flammable to burn
[46:39.540 --> 46:42.420]  up the evidence, it looks like a dashboard bomb to me.
[46:42.420 --> 46:46.260]  Right. Yeah, because that was a very intense fire. Like that looks even more intense than
[46:46.260 --> 46:48.700]  that would have been. I mean, that car was completely-
[46:48.700 --> 46:49.700]  Well, fragmentation.
[46:49.700 --> 46:55.420]  Yeah. I mean, Jeezy and Etta brought that to my attention and I'm like, we got to go,
[46:55.420 --> 46:59.140]  you guys are talking about this right now. And it's just so, he's writing about drones.
[46:59.140 --> 47:00.140]  Yeah.
[47:00.140 --> 47:01.140]  And-
[47:01.140 --> 47:02.140]  I don't know that drone strike, I mean, that does.
[47:02.140 --> 47:03.140]  Yeah.
[47:03.140 --> 47:06.620]  That's a drone, yeah. Let me show people on document cam that are watching on TV, go ahead.
[47:06.620 --> 47:11.740]  And also I sent the guys a link, McChrystal was on that billboard a while back that we
[47:11.740 --> 47:19.020]  covered. And it was when Colin Powell and a bunch of those guys came here to speak,
[47:19.020 --> 47:26.980]  Rudy Giuliani was the other guy. And somebody put up their Pat Tillman and the numbers on
[47:26.980 --> 47:27.980]  it, it was pretty crazy.
[47:27.980 --> 47:31.340]  They put a star on the guy's forehead. I don't know, it was pretty, and I just thought that
[47:31.340 --> 47:32.340]  was interesting.
[47:32.340 --> 47:34.300]  Some bad person climbed up on there and did that here in Austin?
[47:34.300 --> 47:35.300]  I know.
[47:35.300 --> 47:36.300]  I wonder who that was.
[47:36.300 --> 47:37.300]  I don't believe it.
[47:37.300 --> 47:38.300]  That's disrespectful.
[47:38.300 --> 47:41.780]  I just think that people already know the truth about this guy, and people have known
[47:41.780 --> 47:46.900]  it for years. And he's still walking around scot-free at that point.
[47:46.900 --> 47:48.980]  How dare someone climb up on a billboard and do that?
[47:48.980 --> 47:51.540]  I hate when people do that.
[47:51.540 --> 47:52.980]  We should just let these people kill everybody.
[47:52.980 --> 47:53.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[47:53.980 --> 47:57.300]  Because we should all be scared of them too.
[47:57.300 --> 47:59.260]  This Hastings thing is gonna get a lot deeper, definitely.
[47:59.260 --> 48:04.340]  Well, I don't even think they care now. I'm surprised they didn't have a drone fly over
[48:04.340 --> 48:07.580]  in broad daylight announced, we're now going to blow it up, kind of like Dorner. We're
[48:07.580 --> 48:10.020]  gonna burn it down. All right, bring the fire, burn it down.
[48:10.020 --> 48:13.180]  Yeah, well, and the guy said it's suddenly jackknife. I mean, that could be from a bomb
[48:13.180 --> 48:16.300]  or it could be from a drone strike. How do these things happen?
[48:16.300 --> 48:19.940]  Actually, when they hit one, they do kind of fly up and do that. Wow, it depends on
[48:19.940 --> 48:21.100]  what kind of missile they used.
[48:21.100 --> 48:22.300]  I mean, are they that brazen at this point?
[48:22.300 --> 48:26.200]  Well, if it was a bomb from underneath that had enough force in it to sever the engine
[48:26.200 --> 48:31.060]  and send it down 150 feet down the road, I mean, it would go up, lift up in the air.
[48:31.060 --> 48:34.660]  Yeah, that sounds like 8, 10 pounds of plastic.
[48:34.660 --> 48:40.700]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. But it's not a situation where it did not crash into
[48:40.700 --> 48:41.700]  the tree.
[48:41.700 --> 48:42.700]  No.
[48:42.700 --> 48:44.900]  Pan him in there and then catch fire. That is not what happened.
[48:44.900 --> 48:46.620]  But that's what the LA is saying.
[48:46.620 --> 48:51.500]  Here's the deal. If my car blows up, they killed me, okay? All right, good job, dude.
[48:51.500 --> 48:53.180]  All right, we'll be covering this more.
[48:53.180 --> 48:57.720]  Well, one other thing from McChrystal is, you may remember, he was also a big proponent
[48:57.720 --> 49:02.460]  of the universal service. So in spite of his criticisms of Obama that were reported by
[49:02.460 --> 49:07.100]  Michael Hastings that caused him to get fired, he really loves Obama's programs, right? He
[49:07.100 --> 49:12.740]  loves national service, and he hates citizens having weapons. He made the rounds of all
[49:12.740 --> 49:13.740]  the talk shows.
[49:13.740 --> 49:14.740]  He's an anti-gunner. He's a real authoritarian.
[49:14.740 --> 49:16.380]  Oh, yeah, and he was talking about-
[49:16.380 --> 49:18.820]  Better not talk too bad about him. I'll end up like Pat Tillman.
[49:18.820 --> 49:22.820]  So why do you want to have to have military weapons? And what he would talk about would
[49:22.820 --> 49:27.020]  be the velocity of the bullet. He wasn't talking about the fact that Homeland Security is getting
[49:27.020 --> 49:31.780]  hollow point bullets, which are far more destructive to people. He was talking about, oh, these
[49:31.780 --> 49:35.380]  military bullets, they travel this speed, you don't need that. And it's like, the speed
[49:35.380 --> 49:36.380]  of the bullet doesn't have to be-
[49:36.380 --> 49:42.900]  But these guys are such gangsters, illegally spying on us. And Alexander, the head of
[49:42.900 --> 49:46.340]  the NSA, says, hey, I'm gonna meet with the FBI director, and I'll have him a frickin'
[49:46.340 --> 49:50.540]  beer. I mean, it's all just, there's just such a bunch of goons.
[49:50.540 --> 49:52.820]  Yeah, yeah, but-
[49:52.820 --> 49:54.980]  They will destroy this country if they're able to.
[49:54.980 --> 49:59.940]  Yeah, it's just amazing to me, as I said, when I look at this, how the media is just
[49:59.940 --> 50:04.820]  falling in lockstep with this official narrative. And you can see the pictures, even that the
[50:04.820 --> 50:09.180]  media puts there, that contradict what they're saying. And they still go along with this
[50:09.180 --> 50:10.180]  L.A.
[50:10.180 --> 50:13.180]  Well, that's always the evidence, is there immediately, no foul blame, ran into a tree.
[50:13.180 --> 50:14.180]  Yeah.
[50:14.180 --> 50:15.180]  And the witnesses all say the opposite.
[50:15.180 --> 50:16.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:16.180 --> 50:21.500]  And again, he tells WikiLeaks, I'm being followed by the FBI. I gotta get this out quick. I
[50:21.500 --> 50:25.020]  mean, they'd be like, the government's following me, oh, and my car blows up. It's like, oh,
[50:25.020 --> 50:29.700]  nothing to see here, go on to sleep. And will the media stand up, you prostitutes of the
[50:29.700 --> 50:34.700]  globalist shelling out your families, even as they kill you? Do you have any spines?
[50:34.700 --> 50:39.060]  Do you have anything? I just don't get it. And I guess the system doesn't even care if
[50:39.060 --> 50:42.020]  we're out here talking about this, cuz they think the general public's cowards and will
[50:42.020 --> 50:45.060]  just roll over that much more to this gangster government.
[50:45.060 --> 50:49.840]  That's right. Yeah, if you look at him going at a high speed, it could be that they made
[50:49.840 --> 50:53.420]  sure that you knew that they were following him. Yeah, they could have been chasing him
[50:53.420 --> 50:56.620]  then blowing the car up. Who knows? I mean, we can speculate about that. But what we know
[50:56.620 --> 51:00.620]  is it did not blow up and catch fire because it hit the tree.
[51:00.620 --> 51:04.900]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[52:01.060 --> 52:05.820]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[52:05.820 --> 52:11.500]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes people panic. It would be wise to
[52:11.500 --> 52:17.100]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[52:17.100 --> 52:21.420]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really

[54:03.100 --> 54:09.220]  Alex Jones back live. You know, as we sit here and talk about political assassination
[54:09.220 --> 54:14.340]  by this criminal shadow government that will murder a million Iraqis for some no bid weapons
[54:14.340 --> 54:20.300]  contracts because they like it. A global government run by people like Bayer that on purpose puts
[54:20.300 --> 54:26.620]  HIV and hepatitis in the factor eight for people. I mean, of course, we're all in grave
[54:26.620 --> 54:32.460]  danger and are complying and groveling. Greece is the skids for them. Texas is known for
[54:32.460 --> 54:37.580]  being free because my ancestors and many of your ancestors would stand up to dictators
[54:37.580 --> 54:40.380]  instead of cowering in fear.
[54:40.380 --> 54:45.820]  And I just don't understand this living on the knees thing. It's disgusting. It's all
[54:45.820 --> 54:59.780]  a fear based society. Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen. Aaron Swartz, who was
[54:59.780 --> 55:06.020]  connected into WikiLeaks, fighting SOPA, CISPA, leaking a lot of data, leading the fight.
[55:06.020 --> 55:10.660]  He proposed to his fiance about a week before he was killed. He said, I'm going to beat
[55:10.660 --> 55:14.300]  this in court. I'm going to fight it. I'm very confident. And they came to his house
[55:14.300 --> 55:17.660]  and hung him.
[55:17.660 --> 55:25.060]  Came to his apartment and hung him. Killed him better than a hammer. And then said, the
[55:25.060 --> 55:30.180]  district attorney that's, by the way, running the Boston bombing cover up, she drove him
[55:30.180 --> 55:36.000]  to it. I mean, they could have all these media attacks on me right now and say, Alex got
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.500]  driven to suicide.
[55:37.500 --> 55:44.580]  I would commit suicide when hell freezes over. Never, never, never, never, never, never,
[55:44.580 --> 55:49.260]  never, okay? And they killed Aaron Swartz, folks, and they're killing you in the vaccines
[55:49.260 --> 55:54.780]  and the GMO. And you've got to realize it's like the plot of Elysium coming out.
[55:54.780 --> 55:59.160]  Matt Damon's been poisoned, radiated in a factory. His only hope is to get to the space
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.780]  station where they've got live extension technology. He's going to die in five days anyways. Why
[56:03.780 --> 56:08.700]  shouldn't he just get up there? I realized I had nothing to lose. I'm not lying to myself
[56:08.700 --> 56:10.960]  here.
[56:10.960 --> 56:14.700]  And I love my children more than anything. But they have no future if I don't beat the
[56:14.700 --> 56:17.980]  globalists. That's why they're beyond the globalist's reach. Because if they go after
[56:17.980 --> 56:22.580]  them, they're destroyed anyways if this thing wins. The globalists are gearing up to release
[56:22.580 --> 56:24.860]  bioweapons and wipe out almost everybody.
[56:24.860 --> 56:29.900]  What am I going to try to do, make $5 billion in gravel to the elite? And then try to go
[56:29.900 --> 56:33.900]  join them and maybe I'll be given a pass when all this comes down? I don't want to live
[56:33.900 --> 56:37.300]  in a world like that. I'm not going to sign on to killing all these people. I'm not going
[56:37.300 --> 56:42.500]  to sign on to putting cancer virus in little kids' shots and watching them get cancer.
[56:42.500 --> 56:47.220]  I mean, just every time I think about the innocents and the aborted children and all
[56:47.220 --> 56:53.820]  the evil going on, I just have no fear. As a man, I was born to just stand up to the
[56:53.820 --> 57:00.260]  tyrants so you can car bomb me, slit my throat, poison me, whatever. I am beyond you. I am
[57:00.260 --> 57:02.500]  in Jesus Christ's hands forever.
[57:02.500 --> 57:08.580]  And if you don't believe in God, I choose justice. I choose being a good creature, not
[57:08.580 --> 57:16.940]  a sneaking, stealing, murdering, nasty, fraud-driven New World Order. And I hope you'll stand with
[57:16.940 --> 57:24.540]  us in history for goodness, okay? Against all the cynics and all the rest of them.
[57:24.540 --> 57:29.780]  I hope that you will stand with us and I hope you'll promote infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[57:29.780 --> 57:34.020]  because I don't want to just do this halfway and get killed for nothing. I know we can
[57:34.020 --> 57:38.860]  change history. I know there's different forces in this world. And so I'm fully committed.

[58:55.220 --> 59:00.260]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The highest rates of diabetes,
[59:00.260 --> 59:07.460]  autism and every other major disease. It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[59:07.460 --> 59:13.140]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[59:13.140 --> 59:18.920]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[59:18.920 --> 59:23.800]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:27.140]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. We're going to open the phones up in the next
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:35.660]  segment on the opening of the borders and gutting of the country. We're going to get
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.420]  into jobless claims rise as manufacturing growth slows in the great new globalist economy.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.760]  We're going to look at some of the mental health bills going to different governor's
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.720]  desk that just allow them to take guns basically from anybody. SARS virus has high mortality
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.380]  rate in Saudi Arabia. Privacy officials from six countries request details on Google Glasses.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:01:00.060]  This is turning you into a Google agent going around spying for them. You bring the connect
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.760]  into your house and pay to have it, look through your walls and spy on you and report back
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:11.100]  to Northcom, which is global con. And then of course, we have the Michael Hastings, the
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.100]  witnesses saying his car just blew up all over the road. They blew him up. He said the
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:21.460]  FBI was following him about two hours, hour and a half before his car blew up. So unbelievable.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.100]  We're going to be covering that, recapping that, coming up in the hour. We just had David
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:31.300]  Knight in about 30 minutes breaking down the different angles of that. And then we've got
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:37.020]  a lot of other news. The UN is calling for a global kill switch and Russia agrees with
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:41.140]  them. That story is up in the middle column at DrudgeReport.com. And also if you click
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:47.380]  on the top stories tab of Infowars.com, it's already rolled off the main page. That's the
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:51.820]  only problem with Infowars. So many of our top stories are not long like Drudge where
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:57.140]  more can be up there on the front page, it rolls off. And then it's all just so incredibly,
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:01.420]  it's also super creepy. It's like, man, I better hurry up and expose these people and
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.420]  somehow have a breakthrough and back things off before they come for me. They've already
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:11.580]  come for my name, telling wilder and wilder lies, just at a level I've never seen before.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.480]  They're so angry. We've got reporters that go and take over their press conferences.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:23.100]  If they kill me for anything, it'll be sending Dan Vedandi. They might whack him too as a
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.460]  message, but probably not. They'd probably come after me if they go after anybody for
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.060]  going and taking over those press conferences. There's a reason hundreds of reporters were
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.220]  at those and the FBI said, you do not look at his photos and you do not listen to him.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.780]  They all said, yes, sir. And then privately came over and said, we agree with you, but
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.940]  we're all scared cuz they know, I'll just take you around back and blow your head off.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:50.180]  I mean, this country is mafia run, government runs Al-Qaeda. And again, you got FBI that
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:55.580]  investigate child kidnappings and bank robberies, they're the light side of the FBI. Joel Skalzen
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.260]  can break that down for you.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:02.480]  He's had family in the FBI and studied it. And you've got the real operators that sit
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.180]  there and basically let the regular FBI do their paperwork for them. That's the same
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.820]  thing at the ATF, same thing at the CIA, same thing at the NSA. You have the compartmentalized
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.100]  criminal group that now has gotten to be about half or more.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.060]  Skalzen estimates the last few years it's past the 50-50 mark. I mean, they've killed
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:25.100]  hundreds of army investigators and dozens of marine investigators who would go expose
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:30.100]  stealing and thieving going on. And they'll just shoot them three times in the chest and
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.740]  then have the army coroner say, they shot himself three times in the chest.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:41.780]  And if a general tries to stand up, they just kill them. Congressman stands up, like Hightower
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:48.620]  did that time, and blow up his airplane. I met his son at Charlie Sheen's house, that
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:52.860]  was pretty interesting. He said he'd come on the show, then I think I brought his card
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.660]  back. Do we ever call him?
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:00.060]  I just can't handle it anymore. It's just so insane, why? Why do we let the worst people
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:04.180]  holding on everything? Don't people get, it's not sexy and cool like the movies say, and
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:13.380]  that corruption grows? Corruption's like locking up 20 dogs in your house with all the food
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.780]  they can eat for a month and coming back.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:22.140]  What do you think it always looks like? It'll be knee deep and you know what? And they try
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:27.220]  to dress it up, gangsterism and all this is cool. It just makes me wanna throw up. It
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.820]  makes me wanna throw up as the system shakes down farmers and hardworking people and takes
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.340]  poor people's paycheck to give it to foreign banks.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:40.700]  And that's media propaganda, tell them in social envy, class envy, we're taxing to get
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:47.420]  the rich people. It's so sick as they work overtime. The globalists think of us as scum
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:53.500]  because we put up with all this. Maybe we are. Maybe humanity deserves to be ruled by
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:05:00.900]  a bunch of murderers because we don't put up with it. That's the attitude of the globalists.

[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:04.780]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us? As we've moved through
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:10.180]  history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:17.500]  dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche. From
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:23.180]  compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:28.500]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:32.500]  loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.340]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:41.500]  the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:07:06.860]  endorse but demand a war.

[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:16.740]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give out the
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:23.620]  phone number and get your take on the amnesty plan they're preparing. Evidence indicating
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.380]  Michael Hastings of Rolling Stone that had a big story coming out that was supposedly
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:34.100]  gonna shake the CIA. So his car blew up driving down the street witnesses said it was an explosion.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:39.820]  The engine went over 50 yards down the street with no fire. Looks like classic car bomb
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:45.380]  in the dashboard or under the car bare minimum type explosion. He said the FBI is after me,
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:51.680]  the FBI is following me an hour and a half before in a tweet to WikiLeaks.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.100]  So I mean, you're being followed, the feds are after you, your car blows up. And you've
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:01.820]  got all these other people like the Zarnav brother friend who was speaking out and the
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.060]  FBI comes to his house, shoots him in the top of the head. He's unarmed. Pat Tillman,
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:12.260]  the list goes on and on. Aaron Schwartz said I'm gonna beat these fake Justice Department
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.260]  charges.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:22.580]  I'm getting married. They come to his house and hanging and then say we drove him to suicide.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.700]  The DC madam said on this show a month before they hung her in her mother's shed, I will
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:31.380]  never commit suicide. I will never commit suicide. And then some guy that was proven
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.700]  she didn't even know on the other side of the country comes out and says she told me
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.380]  she was with no proof.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.980]  So if they kill me like that, they'll have someone pop up and say Alex said he was gonna
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:48.220]  do it. Whoever says that is a liar, is a liar. They could have a gun to my head saying they
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:52.980]  come after my children. If I didn't write a suicide note, I'm not writing nothing. You
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:53.980]  understand?
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:59.340]  And I'm never committing suicide. I want that on record. And again, they also haven't killed
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:04.500]  me yet because they know my media organization is going to come after this investigation
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:10.020]  and is going to go after it 110% and no one's going to shut up or stop. We know they're
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:16.340]  doing the NDAA. That's why Obama wanted on paper to be able to say he could kill US citizens
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:23.020]  anytime he wanted inside of the United States or worldwide, but we won't use it.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.460]  They are using it. Michael Hastings, award winning journalist and Buzzfeed reporter dies
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:34.180]  at 33. It appears he was driving at a high rate of speed at the scene of the crash. There
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:41.900]  were no skid marks. The car is not smashed up against a tree consistent with what said
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:48.140]  it's just up against one and the engine is down the road. Yeah, no, they blew the car
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.140]  off.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:54.620]  And there it is, an ABC local, there's no skid marks. It's just blown into pieces with
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.980]  the engine down the road. People said they heard a huge explosion and saw it burst into
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.020]  flames driving down the road. And we covered all that last hour. It's in Paul Watson's
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:08.900]  article on infowars.com right now. Here's some of the other news up on infowars.com.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:19.380]  People waking up to NSA spying, privacy search engines are booming. NSA capable of false
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:25.140]  flag attached by Kit Daniels. They're the ones wired into everything. Evidence indicates
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:33.020]  Michael Hastings was assassinated. Superman goes bad, joins the NSA. It's a satire piece.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.820]  Got some great graphics out that our crew put together by the way of Superman looking
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:44.020]  through walls and things. Tell TSA what you think about its surface mode Gestapo. And
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:51.940]  now on the streets of America, cancer survivor wins Supreme Court battle over gene patenting.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:58.700]  The dark side of Ray Kurzweil's transhumanist utopia. And then there's Kurt Nimmo's article
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:11:59.700]  from last night.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.540]  Is journalist Michael Hastings a victim of Obama assassination policy? That's some of
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:10.900]  the news up on infowars.com. Let's play a clip from ABC News local in LA talking about
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:17.300]  Michael Hastings and talking to witnesses about what they saw and what they heard. Here
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.300]  it is.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.580]  Rolling Stone magazine called Michael Hastings a fearless journalist who refused to cozy
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.860]  up to power. His death at 33 came by way of a fire fueled and explosive crash.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:33.540]  It sounded like a bomb went off in the middle of the night. My house shook. The windows
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:38.340]  were rattling. Couldn't have written a scene like this for a movie where the engine flies
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:44.160]  from the car, which was about, I don't know, 50, 60 yards up right down here to this telephone
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.500]  pole. Ladies and gentlemen, he could be going 150 miles an hour. I've seen a lot of wrecks,
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.140]  especially in a Mercedes, the way they're built. You're not going to have the engine
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:13:02.100]  fly down the road. They could blow up anybody. And people are just told, it just ran into
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.100]  a tree.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:08.900]  And then you look, it's been blown off the road, and it's up against a tree. Not sandwiched
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:20.980]  up against it, not an indent from it. It's just setting up against a tree. Unbelievable.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:27.980]  I'd say 95, 98% chance they killed this guy. And he says, I'm being followed by the FBI.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.580]  I've got a big thing coming out that could blow the CIA wide open. And they said, really?
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.620]  Think so, bud? We got something that's gonna blow you wide open.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:42.140]  And he founded the CIA, OSS, British Intelligence, and Skull and Bones at Yale, which was set
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:48.660]  up by the British East India Company in 1832 under the Russell Trust, who had the world
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:55.780]  monopoly on opium into the West. And who then lobbied to get opium made illegal so they
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:01.300]  could shut down all their competition in the 1930s.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:05.580]  The CIA has always been there to bring the drugs in. The CIA has always been there for
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.620]  the robber barons. People started fighting the robber barons in the 1850s, 60s, 70s,
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:14.260]  80s, 90s, right through the 20s. The robber barons would just show up with a railroad
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:21.860]  train full of Pinkerton Security and others. And it's just like in, what movie is that
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:22.860]  with Clint Eastwood?
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:30.500]  A toll free number to join us, folks, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And we'll start going to your
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:36.660]  phone calls here in a moment. My point is that it's not High Plains Drifter, but it's
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:41.980]  kind of a remake of it where Eastwood goes to the mining town. And they want the people
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.180]  to give up their claim where they found gold, the railroad does with the big miner company.
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:49.860]  And they send in the detectives to start killing people.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.620]  Folks, those are true stories. There were hundreds of events like that in Colorado,
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:15:01.300]  you name it. But also in New Jersey and places where they would show up with the army or
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:05.380]  they would show up with hundreds of Pinkerton or other security guys and just start gatling
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.140]  gunning towns.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.940]  Just taking property that wasn't even theirs. And people started arming, they called them
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:18.540]  sagebrush rebellion, started killing them. People started beating the army, beating Pinkerton.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:23.020]  People started organizing, going, you wanna start killing? Let's start killing. And people
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.700]  would also find out who the Pinkerton people's family were and other groups and they'd go
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.020]  to another state and kill them.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:35.180]  Not their family, but the people that ran it. Frontier people started going, you wanna
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:40.500]  hit us? We'll hit you right back. So it all went underground in national security. And
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:47.540]  then we say, America doesn't kill people. It's like in The Godfather where Kay says
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:58.780]  to Michael Corleone, says to him, okay, my dad has people killed sometimes.
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:03.340]  That's what presidents and senators do. And she goes, Michael, presidents and senators
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:12.200]  don't have people killed. He goes, who's being naive now? Okay, and see the argument is,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.220]  and it's really true cuz The Godfather is based on real mafia families, real names,
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.220]  they just changed them.
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:25.820]  That's on record, Mario Puzo. It's got all the main characters in it who are real people.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:37.580]  And when you expand on all of this, the argument is, well, the old mafia just stood up when
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:43.460]  the police were their own mafia, they would stand up for you. But then notice how that
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:49.060]  mafia turned into something just as bad or worse, and that's how this gang society operates.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:17:02.640]  And pretty soon, that's all you've got left. Pretty soon, all you've got left is gangs.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.020]  And then what gang are you in? And then gangs tend to stop working. And everybody joins
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.960]  a gang and then society collapses or they go out and grab the peasants and put them
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.000]  in slave camps to produce for them.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.020]  But then slave camps aren't very productive. So it gets to the point where even the heads
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:27.220]  of the countries can't even get good food or good clothing, like North Korea. And they
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:32.100]  will wreck everything if they have their way, they will wreck everything. Because why shouldn't
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:37.840]  big corporations, if they have a mafia government, why shouldn't General Electric give every
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.620]  year on average over $100 million to the Democratic Party, they also give the Republican, to have
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:47.580]  them come in and shut down every power plant they don't own, and then double and triple
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:48.980]  your prices?
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.300]  Why shouldn't they? Why shouldn't we have rolling blackouts now all over the country
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.620]  who don't have enough infrastructure? Why shouldn't they shut down our factories and
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:03.300]  pay $20 plus billion of taxpayer money to move General Motors, Volt, Cadillac, you name
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:10.060]  it, to China? So they can have robots replace the people and have the people go die in the
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:13.500]  streets starving to death, not even helping with Chinese.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:20.020]  I mean, why not? We'll put up with it, why not? Because they have disdain for us. You
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:26.300]  look at Rahm Emanuel, who was the real president, till he got kicked out by some other insiders
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:30.020]  because he was so arrogant and so mentally ill, reportedly, and sent to be the mob boss
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.940]  in Chicago, where I'm sure he can listen on 1530.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:37.780]  He routinely at Democratic Party events grabs butcher knives and starts going, just stabbing
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.980]  the table and thumbing at the mouth going, murder, everyone, murder, murder, the Republicans,
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:50.300]  murder, murder. And he'll be in meetings with Obama and just go, shut up. And literally,
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.660]  just slap Obama on the arm, just start stumbling around on a power trip.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:19:01.260]  I mean, this is what runs America. And then he gets up on TV and goes, we're gonna have
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:05.580]  national's conscription. Your kids are gonna serve in a domestic armed force in America,
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:10.980]  working for us. I mean, just crazy mafia, your kids work for us, we're gonna arm them.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:14.100]  And then you get the training manuals, and it's to fight gun owners. I mean, these are
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:22.660]  just Joe Stalin wrapped in Hitler, wrapped in the gangsters of old.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:26.940]  But now they've got satellites and drones and robots and weapons, and they're just running
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:33.300]  around with jets landing all the kidnapped kids on record, loading them up in Chicago,
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:38.820]  in Houston, they fly them out to Saudi Arabia, Thailand. Local cops try to expose it, they
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.300]  kill the cops. I mean, they just, you wanna know where your kids are going? It's going
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:50.020]  to these people. Why not? You put up with it. I'm telling you, folks, you gotta stand
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:55.460]  up against these people. They're a bunch of knuckle dragon gangsters who've got nuclear
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:59.100]  weapons. God help us.

[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.980]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:11.460]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:17.060]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:21.380]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really

[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:18.700]  Will we be freer slaves? Well, we act like a bunch of not-kneed cowards. The wolves will
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.820]  do that. They go out in the field at night and squeal like a dying bunny rabbit. Good
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.180]  chance coyotes are going to come over the hill. And if you roll over on your back and
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:33.820]  act like you're prey, they might actually kill you. Coyotes are now killing Americans
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:39.380]  routinely. Never before happened in recorded history. Only wolves would do that of starving,
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:43.220]  but people fall down groveling and crying when they see them in a park. They think,
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:49.980]  well, that's something to eat. The American people act like a prey animal.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:56.700]  And so we're growing predators faster than you can count them. And then they tell us
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.060]  how they're doing it for our safety. I'm gonna go to your phone calls, but up on Infowars.com
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:07.860]  and prisonplanet.com. Superman goes bad, joins the NSA. And I like to hijack popular memes
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.500]  to then illustrate that he has x-ray vision. He's looking through the building there at
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:18.100]  the lady in the shower. It's not a risque photo. It just illustrates that actually with
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.580]  Kinect systems and smart meters, Kinect can look through your walls and see you in the
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:27.100]  shower. We should probably add that to the write-up there. But Don Salazar heard me talk
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:32.060]  about this yesterday and put it out, and our great graphics crew came up with that graphic.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.900]  They did some others I guess they put on the cutting room floor, but they ought to add
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:40.620]  those to it. And I'm gonna send that out on Twitter at Real Alex Jones as well right now.
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:47.660]  But right now, speaking of right now, let's go to Truth Raider in Oregon, here on the
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.660]  air.
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:51.740]  Good afternoon, Alex Jones and all the influencers out there in the world. This is the Truth
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:56.180]  Raider. Getting in your face with the facts. We're talking about amnesty and talking about
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:01.940]  the borders being wide open. I have an issue with a next door neighbor. I completely don't
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:07.660]  want to have any contact with him. I leave him alone. I go out my back door to avoid
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.300]  them completely. I went out last night to go up to the store, get something to eat.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:16.300]  The guy's on the other side of the street heckling me, and he's whistling at me. So
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:20.940]  I ignore him. I come back, go around the other side of the building on the other side of
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:24.540]  the street. He's on the other side of the street ready to confront me. They say, hey,
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:30.140]  what's up? What's up? And I say, I don't want to talk to you. Oh, and then he starts cussing
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:36.100]  at me. Well, that's what you're doing to me and doing to all of us.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:41.340]  I told him I paid $4,000 and moved 1,000 miles to get away from you. I went into one of my
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:46.020]  Alex Jones rants with him. Oh, I'll call the police. I call the police.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.620]  What you're talking about an illegal alien that you think doesn't like you because you're
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:58.540]  a different skin color? Well, I think that he knows that I'm trying to avoid them. When
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:03.500]  I first moved into my apartment here, I tried to be friendly. I said, hello, how are you?
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:09.180]  And he just gave me a dirty look. Well, I haven't had problems with the illegals,
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.140]  whether they be from Mexico or Eastern Europe or whatever. My issue is that they tend to
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:19.060]  vote anti-gun, pro-government, pro-corrupt government, pro-mafia because that's the cultures
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.060]  they're coming from.
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.940]  Most countries are mafia driven. America's been mafia driven, gang driven. We're trying
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:30.700]  to get away from that and not supercharge it. But I think that I haven't had the experiences
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:35.480]  you're talking about. My experiences with the illegals that make me mad is they're like
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.660]  above the law. We have crew that live in apartments, some of them, and the illegals are allowed
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:40.660]  to do whatever they want.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.780]  But citizens, whether you be white, black, Hispanic, whatever, get the book thrown at
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.580]  you. So I think being in the system, we're seen as chumps by the mafia government, the
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:56.860]  mafia police. And my issue is, but some of you're saying you've had experiences, xenophobic
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:02.460]  experiences towards you because you're not the same as an immigrant group or what?
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:06.500]  I'm an American. I've been in the military, I'm from a retired military. I fought for
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:10.980]  the sovereignty and the freedom of this country. And it's being eviscerated. The Constitution
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:15.780]  and all the due process is being eviscerated. I'm not happy about that. I left California
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:21.200]  to get away from what's all that's going on down there. I mean, all the hosts of all the
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.940]  issues concerning illegal aliens, the gangsters, the gang culture, the crime along the border,
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:27.940]  all of that stuff.
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:33.580]  Trouble with a relative of mine, an elderly, my stepmother who had lots of troubles with
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:38.020]  them for years. They did damage to her property, broke into her place for years.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.780]  No, there's no doubt that there's a crime wave coming out of Mexico. And you're supposed
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.640]  to be politically correct and not talk about it. I mean, Mexico is a collapsed, failed
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:53.580]  state. And obviously then people think they're not liked and then you think you're not liked
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.700]  and the body language intensifies that.
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:01.100]  And I have run into the whole gang culture. And again, you find the gang culture everywhere.
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.760]  I've got family in East Texas and I've worked there and been there in the summer and people
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.060]  come over at the community pool and say, get out of here, you Yankee. Cuz anybody from
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:15.220]  Dallas must be a Yankee. But I hear you and it's just exactly the gang mentality I'm talking
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.220]  about.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.220]  And the gang mentality has a way of putting you into it even if you don't want to be what
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:26.180]  they call racist. It's really gang or tribal. And if you look at Latin America, Africa,
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:29.940]  Europe, whatever, you'd have one group of Scots killing the other group of Scots until
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.940]  the English invaded and then they'd unify.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:36.180]  And in Africa, you'll have animus killing Christians or Muslims killing Christians or
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:42.140]  vice versa. And it's just what humans do. And the globalist manipulate and play that
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:47.620]  I'd rather have a gang that's into science and liberty and freedom and justice and unify
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.060]  around those ideals.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:30:00.660]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:05.340]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:10.340]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The highest rates of diabetes,
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:17.540]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:23.180]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:28.980]  with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.

[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:46.020]  The question is, is the establishment flaunting it on purpose that the private Federal Reserves
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:50.900]  collection agency, the IRS, is targeting liberty lovers? Are they throwing it in our face that
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:54.700]  they're assassinating American citizens all over the world for no reason? Are they throwing
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:34:00.100]  it in our face that foreign banks are taking $85 billion a month and Congress is told to
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.860]  sit down and shut up and not ask who's getting it?
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:08.340]  I think the answer is yes. The globalists just can't help but steal everything. Nobody's
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:14.820]  stopping them. And so they have a method of the madness of just temp us, break our will,
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:20.780]  teach us to accept it as we convert to a society of just groveling idiots who worship nothing
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:27.820]  but hype and foolishness. And any reporters that expose them or actually show the criminality
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:31.500]  they're engaged in, you just kill them.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:40.940]  And that's the future we leave our children. Not a very good society, not a very good future,
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:44.060]  my friends. We're gonna go to your phone calls here. I'm gonna move to a bunch of them. So
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.300]  I have your question and comment ready.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:48.700]  I wanna try to take a lot of calls when you hear somebody hang up. That'll be your chance
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:57.060]  to get involved on air 800-259-9231. Very interesting movie star that I'm a big fan
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:06.640]  of. I've talked about that some before. Ran into some of my people in California while
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:13.020]  they were out there last week and is actually shooting a movie right now in another country
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.700]  and is in character and doesn't ever do interviews when he's in character but said he'd like
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.700]  to come on today.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:24.660]  We kinda got back with them late just because they're in a country where the time zone is
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:31.980]  earlier than us. It's later there. So they'll either be on today or tomorrow because they
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.380]  said that they would like to come on. They like to come on the broadcast. We have some
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:41.140]  very interesting questions here that I sent them.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:44.860]  They said, well, what type of questions would you ask me if I came on? And we sent these
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.140]  and said, oh, I like those questions. I think those are interesting. So obviously, it's
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:53.260]  not even that it's that big of a deal to get a big movie star on the show. I like doing
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:58.100]  that when they talk about political things especially. But it's then wondering if you're
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:35:59.300]  going to get them.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:04.740]  It's almost like having a big, beautiful fish right up to the boat and you're wondering
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:10.140]  if you're gonna get it into the boat. So it's right there at the side of the boat and we'll
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.900]  see what happens coming up. And plus then I have another guest that was already set
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:19.060]  in the next hour, a Second Amendment advocate, really cool guy here in Austin. And so I don't
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.720]  like having to move him around, have him waiting. So we'll see what happens. A lot's coming
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.060]  up here today on the broadcast.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:29.340]  Now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, I wanna tell you about some of the sponsors

[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.060]  go ahead and go to Rod in France. You're on the air, Rod.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:59.540]  Hello, Alex. Good to talk to you again. Wanted to ask you your opinion on the elections that
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:04.620]  will be coming up. As you know, there will not be an incumbent for the presidency. And
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:09.220]  it's, I don't know what you think, but it's for me, it's looking like Rand Paul is going
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:16.380]  to be a serious candidate if he decides to run. And I was wondering, I had heard you
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:24.100]  mentioned something about the, about the electronic voting and maybe, you know, the global have
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:31.740]  their hands in that possibly. And if it came down to the wire and Rand Paul, hypothetically,
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:43.860]  Rand Paul was in the running for the presidency and it was close. And do you think that they
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:48.980]  could play around with the, with the electronic voting and if he did make it in, do you think
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:51.980]  that it's possible that someone would try to take him out because he doesn't have a
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:54.260]  globalistic agenda?
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:40:02.300]  Well just to be clear and I appreciate your call, it's a great question. Just to be clear,
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:08.020]  we get 60% turnouts or close to it, like 57% of the average, I think last four elections
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:14.300]  I saw that a few months back in the newspaper. But it's around 60% turnout in national presidential
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:21.700]  elections and about 45, 50% off year elections. And then on average, you get about 8% turnout
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:26.420]  locally in the country. Travis County happens to be right at the national average, like
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.780]  8.4% last time I saw the numbers where I live.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:33.700]  And in places like Travis County, I've been to the election board at the state. They've
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:40.460]  certified election fraud, but they still rubber stamp it. There is no voting in Austin. And
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:45.540]  that's why it's so fraudulent and socialist and communist and globalist and insiders robbing
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:51.360]  everybody and taking people's private property and out of control zoning boards and just
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.380]  hell on earth.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:57.640]  Because they have been proven over and over again to steal elections. They've had county
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.060]  commissioner elections where somebody's 20 something points ahead and then the county
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:06.780]  commissioner who's friends with the county clerk is in the paper, throws fits and collapses.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:11.340]  And then the county clerk says, it's okay, hun, I'll make it better. And then suddenly
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.340]  they win.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:17.700]  I mean, it's just, they don't even hide it. It's kind of like the CIA publicly brings
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:21.980]  in the drugs or they publicly killed Pat Tillman and it comes out and they don't get in trouble.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:28.740]  I mean, it is just lawless evil. 35, 40% of the country's got certified fraud systems
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:34.060]  in. And if you're voting the way they want, they'll let you actually have it.
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.980]  They've been caught all over the country, die bold, all of them. They have pre-programmed
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:42.180]  algorithms. They have live feeds in the programs to go in, change the votes and then have it
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:47.340]  covered up for them. And that's on record. That's been testified in Florida legislature,
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:51.100]  Ohio, Texas, it's well known.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.840]  Just like it's well known the NSA spies on you without warrants. Just like it's well
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.440]  known they put cancer viruses and all the major vaccines. Just like it's well known
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.660]  sodium fluoride lowers your IQ around 20 points, give you seven fold increase in bone cancer.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:02.540]  I keep going for a couple hours.
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:06.860]  It's just all well known, well known people that know how to tie their shoelaces. And
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:12.180]  so from the experts we've talked to like Bev Harris and many others, I need to call your
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:16.060]  brothers before they died and their daughter and all of them first really exposed it 30,
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:17.540]  40 years ago.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:27.220]  They have trouble fixing big, massive landslides. But they could still do that. So that's why
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:34.800]  they're so arrogant. That's why they pass the NDAA and say we'll kill you if we want.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:40.900]  That's why they run the narcotics. Why they take over a million kids every year. Why state
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:43.860]  and federal courts are ruling they can take your kids for no reason.
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:47.700]  That was in the news yesterday. This is how tyranny works. They've got a group, an army
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:51.040]  of criminals, an army of scum, an army of control freaks who will do whatever they're
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.100]  told or they'll be replaced. And they're marching against us and they're stealing and robbing
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:56.660]  and destroying everything.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:00.500]  And they will accelerate it until everything is destroyed and sewage is running down the
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:04.280]  streets and you are completely poor. They will destroy healthcare. They will destroy
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:08.300]  our borders. They will rob everything. It's what they do unless we stand up to them and
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:13.980]  just basically we've eaten poison. We're gonna get very sick if we don't vomit the poison
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.240]  out.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.820]  And we may not make it even if we were to vomit it all out now. So much of it's in the
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:25.220]  bloodstream. And this is how society dies and people wanna die. And in a way we've killed
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:29.580]  53 million babies in America and say they're not humans. Well, you're not human either.
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:33.780]  And you let them go kill Iraqis and take everything they've got so the bankers will take everything
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:39.500]  you've got. That's how it works. It's the spiritual law of the universe. It's a law
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:40.740]  of quantum mechanics.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:48.100]  It's a law of physics. That what comes around goes around. That's why you have empathy.
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:53.500]  I don't need to cold bloodedly say I'm against killing Iraqis, over a million of them just
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:57.820]  so globalist make money because it'll come back on me. I have empathy. I'm hard wired
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:04.500]  to not like it in my gut, in my spirit.
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:10.580]  But that hard wiring is also there as a survival mechanism. And people think not caring is
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:17.660]  tough. They're gonna find out. No one is immune. No one is immune. Everyone will drink from
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:22.900]  this cup. And there's not gonna be a big fake rapture. The Bible doesn't say that upfront
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:28.300]  to get us out of all this. We're gonna go through it.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:34.180]  So I hope everybody gets that through their heads, okay? You want excitement, folks, you're
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.100]  gonna get it. But people are so brainwashed, they won't even know. People think they're
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.660]  bored. You're bored? You're living in the middle of a science fiction movie. They're
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:47.440]  blowing up Rolling Stones reporters on the streets of LA in car bombs.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.940]  They burn down police officers in cabins. Who knows if Dorner even did what they said
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:58.220]  and then say, we burned him up, but we didn't burn him up. They just do whatever they want.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:07.580]  Let's go to, I don't know about Rand Paul. Rand Paul's good because he puts out liberty-based
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.860]  ideas and criticizes tyranny. Scott in Vermont, you're on the air.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.460]  Yeah, hi, Alex. Yeah, you won't see, I don't think you'll see Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:22.540]  talking about conspiracies regarding Hastings. But anyways, I wanna bring up-
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:25.420]  Cuz everybody knows the US government doesn't kill anybody.
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:31.100]  I wanna bring up General Ben Parton. He was so great on the Oklahoma bombing years ago,
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:38.140]  exposing the truth about that. He's a bomb expert. And Flight 800. But the thing is,
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:42.620]  and he's on the film Noble Lie, which is great. I don't know if you've had him on your show,
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:45.380]  but, and you've probably been asked this before. I've been meaning to ask you this-
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.940]  I've had Parton on many times, get Ben Parton on. If you guys don't have his number on the
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:53.260]  computer, he's been on 20 times over the years. Had been on about five years. Former head
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:59.060]  of Air Force weapons development, former head of HARP. I want him on, and you can call the
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:01.140]  Noble Lie guys to get his number if you don't have it.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.420]  Yeah, go ahead. He's denying the very missile that he said,
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:06.340]  the continuous rod warhead missile that he says took down Flight 800-
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:13.060]  No, I know. And reporters heard him. They broke in, got the samples. It was US government
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:18.020]  explosive using that missile, so they arrested them. And where was the media when that happened?
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:20.980]  No, they blew that up because it was full of Egyptian military officers.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:26.220]  Why has he never talked about 9-11? You know, I talked to him after 9-11, and
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:31.380]  he just said, I'm not going there. Going there, huh? Well, maybe sometime before
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:36.580]  he, maybe, you know, worried about it. I wish he would. But you know, the media said yesterday
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:40.940]  that conspiracy, they brought out this new story about these researchers on the original
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:45.420]  investigators now coming out, now that they're retired, got their pensions, coming out and
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.460]  saying that there's a cover-up. They said, you know, conspiracy theorists
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:53.980]  have long thought there was a sinister plot there. No, we were talking about, they were
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:58.540]  talking about an accident. The Navy, and it's come out, the people that were on the inside
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:00.380]  have told their family. I know somebody who knows somebody from the Navy.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:04.900]  Yeah, it wasn't an accident. They routed the aircraft over the drill to get rid of the
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:09.860]  Egyptians. They blew it up. It had a bunch of other military officers on it as well.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:13.340]  Boy, and all those kids- They blow up aircraft full of military all
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:19.020]  the time. I don't know why these governments fly a bunch of top generals together on the
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:23.820]  same aircraft. In Pennsylvania that were learning French
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:30.140]  and going over to France there, and they died too. Well, that's too bad, Alex, but we gotta
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:34.300]  expose that and everything else too. And don't worry about them calling us conspiracy theorists
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:39.700]  or whatever, because a lot of it's true. Notice this is all coming out now, though.
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:43.980]  All these scandals that were already there. It's not that Snowden isn't a hero, and I
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:50.260]  think he's a real person. It's that they knew months before, and Washington Post and Guardian
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:57.700]  were sitting on it. And then they got the green light to go with it, because Benghazi
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:58.700]  will bring them down.
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:03.580]  They had two drones and other aircraft with high def video of the six plus hour stand
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:09.260]  down. And they had those people murdered using the Al-Qaeda security force over Benghazi.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:15.660]  And this wakes up the mafia, who themselves are- I mean, these guys sit around. I have
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:23.580]  sat around with old army black ops operators and people, and they're all the same. They've
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:35.180]  got literal paintings of Western characters on the wall.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:43.580]  They read Louis L'Amour books. John Wayne's on the wall. And they just absolutely think
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:47.980]  we're America, we're the tough guys, we kill everybody, and we use evil tactics cuz we're
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:55.540]  protecting the good. And this whole thing of publicly running Al-Qaeda has really freaked
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:56.540]  the military out.
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:02.260]  I mean, it's like half the military, 40 to 50% now of the non-commissioned officers and
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:05.700]  below are my listeners. That freaks out the system, to the point of they're saying the
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:09.580]  military is the enemy. And you've got all these guys that have done all this bad stuff,
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:12.980]  but they believe and justifies the means, they're now all getting it.
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:19.200]  Something like Benghazi could bring them down, cuz their own hit men, believe me, folks,
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.980]  the army doesn't just go fight battles. They go around killing people 24-7 all over the
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:27.860]  world. And it's mainly the army. That's why whenever Pacini comes in, he goes, the SEALs
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.800]  like to brag about what they do. That's kind of a public unit for PR for the Navy.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.020]  The army doesn't talk about what they do, and the army doesn't like it being talked
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:43.620]  about either, Alex. Cuz it is, the army, from my research, is just giant, giant. I mean,
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:51.260]  just huge secret armies of hit men and saboteurs and just everything else is just mind blowing.
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:55.460]  And the army's got you sat there and killed all these people, and they all know, and hundreds
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:00.100]  of people are in situation rooms watching this. So Benghazi is what they're really afraid
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:06.500]  of, ladies and gentlemen. Benghazi is what they're afraid of.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:10.700]  Because you've got all these guys that think they've done all this stuff for John Wayne
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:16.060]  and to fight the commies and all this stuff. And now they see the country being destroyed,
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:19.540]  everything being devalued. They're being told they're the new enemy. Yeah, cuz they're done
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:24.300]  with you guys now. They're done. They're gonna bring in the drones, the robots. They're gonna
[01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:28.300]  bring in Interpol. They're gonna bring in foreign hit teams now.
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:32.300]  They're done with you. Night of the long knives. And if you guys don't know what that is, you
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:37.260]  better look it up. They're done with you. You're the SA that helped bring Hitler to
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:43.060]  power and now you're gonna get knives shoved into your gullets, okay? They're gonna take
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:45.580]  you and they're gonna kill you and they're gonna poison you and they're gonna slit your
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.660]  throats and they're gonna kill you, okay?
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:53.420]  So go ahead and go kill innocent people and bring drugs in and load little kids on C-130s.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:58.300]  Just remember, you're all dead too, okay? You're dead. We'll be right back with more
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:27.780]  phone calls. Stay with us.
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:34.740]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:38.980]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:43.100]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:46.500]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:47.500]  army?
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.300]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary

[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:35.300]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills? What do you think I'm broke? Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:46.420]  we are back live, butchering Dave Mustaine as we come in. Say hi to Dave and Pam. You
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:51.460]  know, when he comes to town with Iron Maiden, I am going to go see that. People are so stupid
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:56.820]  they think Iron Maiden's satanic. It's the opposite. That's why they like Dave to play
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:01.220]  because he's Christian too, and of course, big draw with Gigantor.
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:05.660]  I was listening to Two Minutes to Midnight, the anti-abortion song, driving into work
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:11.780]  this morning. That's very satanic. A lot of those bands, they say are satanic are actually
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:15.620]  the opposite. They're trying to get you to look at what's going on, to be aware of it.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:20.860]  The real devil comes disguised as an angel of light. By the way, Kurt Nemo just posted
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:28.300]  some breaking news, and this is confirmed. Michael Hastings assassinated for work uncovering
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:33.180]  surveillance state. The journalist Michael Hastings, who died in what authorities have
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:38.580]  described as a high-speed car crash, was an active member of Project PM, a crowdsourcing
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:41.740]  research effort to expose government intelligence creators.
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:47.780]  Yeah, a big Anonymous group has come out and said that they're going to investigate him
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:51.460]  being murdered, so Anonymous knows what's going on. And we've got that article up on
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:58.660]  infoatwars.com. The login screen for Trapwire, software used for intelligence gathering on
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:05.420]  US and global citizens, and made public in WikiLeaks data stamp, data dump. And they've
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.460]  gone public with the fact that he was working on Trapwire with them.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:12.820]  And he did have the FBI, quote, following him when his car blew up. Just how much more
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:18.380]  obvious does this get? And we told you they killed Pat Tillman. And it came out that old
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:23.100]  McChrystal was over that cover-up, and I'm sure over more than that. And it did turn
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:32.180]  out he was murdered. And who did Michael Hastings burn? McChrystal, the head of Army Special
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.420]  Operations.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:42.340]  That's as gangster as it gets. By the way, we have another former head of Special Operations
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.260]  who said he wanted to come on the show, and I just got so busy, I never even called him
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:52.380]  up. That's how pathetic I am. And there's a lot of security concerns, though, that the
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.060]  person has to go through every day.
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:57:02.220]  I mean, these guys are living in prisons, basically. What a horrible world. I mean,
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:08.140]  the most insecure thing you could ever be part of is a tyranny. We've taken a free open
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:13.480]  society that wasn't perfect, but that was not one-tenth as corrupt. And we have just
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:22.500]  absolutely burned up our republic. We have pitted it out, we have wrecked it. And what
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:27.980]  is the establishment doing? They're accelerating down the black hole.
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:33.620]  I've studied history, folks. I mean, the road we're going down is horrible, horrible. It
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:41.500]  will destroy productivity, it will destroy our society. And it's going the way it always
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:46.780]  does, it's accelerating now. Like you've seen the corruption in the last 50 years intensify,
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.660]  it's gonna get more corrupt in the next five than it has the last 50.
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:54.180]  Then it'll get corrupt in the next year after that than in the previous five. It's like
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:58:01.180]  a singularity of evil, a singularity of just orgies of corruption. As psychopaths try to
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:05.960]  get caught and just act out and dominate more and more. This is the criminology, this is
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.940]  the psychology of them. They will destroy themselves because even though they're evil
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:17.940]  and corrupt, their subconscious mind and their human hardwiring wants them to be destroyed.
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:22.120]  And they're going to destroy themselves with us right along with them.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:27.620]  Not a very pretty picture, my friends, not a pretty train we're on. We need to get off
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:36.340]  the train right now. We need to turn this around right now as fast as we can. We'll
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.220]  be right back. Stay with us.

[01:59:53.820 --> 02:00:10.820]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:18.420]  It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:27.580]  and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain
[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:36.860]  halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:46.540]  power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:54.540]  they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:01:02.020]  fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control
[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:09.420]  all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:29.980]  all life. One ring to rule them all. The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:31.980]  on for your mind.
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:37.620]  All right, we've got a guest coming up in studio on the Second Amendment. I want to
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:41.940]  continue with your calls. We have another surprise guest that wanted to come on at one
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:46.180]  today, but I don't know if we got in contact with them soon enough to make sure it happens
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:51.060]  now. It may happen in overdrive or it'll happen tomorrow. But I'm excited about that as well.
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:54.940]  So who knows what's coming up in this hour? Mouse Link in New York. You want to talk about
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.940]  Ray Kurzweil? Welcome to the airwaves.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:59.260]  Hi, Alex. How are you today?
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:00.980]  I'm all right, brother.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:05.540]  You know, I listen to you a lot, and I think that there's a lot of different ways that
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:10.260]  you could be described as a libertarian, as a constitutionalist, a lot of different ways
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:15.940]  that you analyze reality. But the way that I've never heard you described and the way
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:22.100]  that I'm really starting to come to think of you is as a futurist. Maybe the dark futurist.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:27.380]  But if you're following Futurism News and people like Kurzweil, I've seen Kurzweil speak.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:33.460]  I attended the Singularity Summit down in New York City, and I read his book, Fantastic
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:43.660]  Voyage. Futurism is very much kind of rosy. You know, it's kind of saccharine rainbows.
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.660]  And when people get together and they talk about futurism, I don't feel like there's
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:49.500]  a lot of realistic discussion.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:56.780]  No, they sell a dystopic transhumanist system that's really eugenics. It's a prison. They're
[02:02:56.780 --> 02:03:01.260]  on record in their more internal documents as a wonderful new thing, and they're gonna
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:05.740]  be gods. And if you don't get with the program, you'll be left behind. And he's kind of the
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:11.420]  high priest of this new religion that they're selling to make it trendy.
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:17.340]  I'm not even so much a futurist as I'm chronicling what the globalist social engineers are trying
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:22.780]  to build. You understand? I'm warning people. I sound like a futurist because what I talked
[02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:27.260]  about 18 years ago, a lot of it's come true because they're building it. Their blueprints
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:32.860]  are public. They change things a little bit as they try to accentuate it over time and
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:33.860]  they tweak things.
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:40.660]  But I'm here watching an admitted program that they're trying to build. And it's basically
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:50.060]  an Elysium-type world. And there's a lot of people in the system warning the public. I've
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:53.460]  talked to some of these directors off record, some of these big films, and they're saying,
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:56.780]  hey, look, we're awake. We're trying to warn people. This is not propaganda.
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:03.280]  And then I see it come out in some of these films, and it's not. These people are awake.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:11.580]  But they're only allowed to do it in a fiction form, which then the higher level social engineers
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:16.900]  believe is just preparing everyone's mind. But yes, I think that people say, Jones has
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:23.600]  a dystopic futurist view. They're building this. I don't want to have them set my destiny
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:24.600]  and your destiny.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:29.060]  We should have a debate about what do we want our destiny to be, Mouse Link?
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:36.260]  Well, I totally agree with you. And I think that the fact that you hammer this idea of
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:42.260]  normalcy bias a lot, I find that to be really useful when I'm talking to people about futurism
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:48.660]  stuff. We the world is changing. It's changing so rapidly, but we all keep acting like it
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:49.660]  isn't.
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:55.700]  You want to say more? Are you done? I got one of the questions. We'll stay there. We're
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:05:01.700]  going to come back to you. Then more people will see if our surprise guest calls us.
[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:06.460]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:12.140]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:17.740]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:22.060]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:27.220]  be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll

[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:08.640]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.020]  of information.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:17.020]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your

[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:23.540]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:27.140]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:31.340]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:35.220]  verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is happening
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:37.220]  so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:42.220]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:44.180]  but demand a war.

[02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:13.220]  Hello this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:17.660]  Infowars.com
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:32.660]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:39.100]  Monday through Friday baby, we're here for three hours in the face of the global tyrants
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:43.940]  as they assassinate and murder people, openly ship in the drugs, hit foreign banks, $85
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:49.180]  billion of our taxpayer money a month and just are involved in every form of crime.
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:54.660]  We're desperately trying to get humanity off its knees and to stop worshiping illegitimate
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:59.140]  authority. The authority in this country is the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.920]  Declaration of Independence. That's what made this country great. What made all the other
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.700]  countries a bunch of knuckle dragon third world cesspits is the people were slaves and
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:12.740]  never had any freedom.
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:18.500]  Now we have a big guest that again just fell in our lap, who's in another country shooting
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:25.500]  a big movie. And the shooting went a little bit over, so they're gonna be calling in the
[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:29.780]  next 10 minutes is what I've been told. We'll see if that happens. And I had another guest
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:32.700]  who was already scheduled in the studio, we'll do an hour overdrive with them, this is so
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:36.500]  important and he's on the nightly news with Sha'Carri Jackson.
[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:39.740]  We just had a caller who we just tuned in named Mouse Link, he's been to the Ray Kurzweil
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:45.500]  events where he has thousands of people, futurists there, pushing this rosy view of transhumanism.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:50.300]  And I'm not saying machines couldn't augment humanity and actually empower us, for the
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:56.580]  blind to see, to live longer, whatever, I like technology. The problem is, is that the
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:01.740]  ghost in the machine that the globalists are programming in, anything we're given is not
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:07.300]  to augment but to enslave and to shutter reality, Google Glass is all of it.
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:14.300]  That is the direction that this whole system is going. So, at a fundamental level, we need
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:25.180]  to have a discussion about this. You see the new Matt Damon movie by the great director
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:30.900]  who grew up in the middle of tyranny in South Africa of District 8. He's got a Matt Damon
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:34.860]  movie coming out, and I don't like Matt Damon's anti-liberty politics, but I like him as an
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:38.020]  actor, so it's a paradox.
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:45.020]  And we now know the script, he's a slave worker basically, building robots that are used by
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:49.940]  the globalists that live in compact cities and space stations, who basically have eternal
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:56.420]  life and everybody else is dying of toxic waste and cancer. And when he gets radiated
[02:10:56.420 --> 02:11:01.500]  in an accident in the factory, they just tell him, okay, here's your pain pills, go home
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:05.140]  and die. And that's actually what they do with the troops.
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:09.300]  That's what they do with people that are exposed to this stuff. This is how we're seeing. It's
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:16.220]  not gonna be in the year 2,154 that all of this is going to happen. This is going to
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:23.220]  happen in the next 25, 30, 40 years everywhere. In China, the three major companies, Foxconn
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:30.220]  and two others, are now putting in orders with robot factories in China and North America
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:35.060]  to build 15 million.
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:40.620]  The first 5 million just got delivered last month. Look it up, 15 million robots are being
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:47.460]  delivered that are worked on by robots, that are built by robots. And the goal is get us
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:53.360]  out of the equation. Why are we allowing the engineering of a future where we're not needed?
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.760]  And it's not that things come out so the horse is obsolete cuz the automobile. This is where
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:06.040]  things are being designed to where humans will fight for less and less resources. And
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:09.460]  then the economy will be slowly imploded.
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:15.360]  And then they'll use the fact that we're poor to social engineer us to get us in line socially
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:22.360]  for mass extermination via bioweapons. So if you wanna know the future, it's 12 Monkeys
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:29.820]  meets Elysium, meets The Running Man, meets Brave New World, meets 1984. And you ask,
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:37.380]  why is all the stuff written in the 30s, like Brave New World, why is that what they've
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:38.600]  now built?
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:45.340]  Because the writer of that was part of a government genetic engineering program that failed for
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:52.340]  from 1860 until then. Most of the children died or were totally insane. A few had super
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:57.180]  high IQs like Aldous Huxley and his brother Julian Huxley went on to run the UN. And he
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:59.700]  gave speeches saying this is the real plan.
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:06.700]  You go read 1984, that's what it as a British MI6 agent and before that OSS, that's what
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:13.700]  George Arwell was told was gonna be built. And he gave speeches, and on his deathbed
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:21.760]  confessed to all this. You better find out folks that all the stuff I talk about isn't
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:28.760]  coming true because I am psychic, even though we've all got a little of the touch.
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:35.940]  It's that this information is all admitted. The decision has been made to build this utopia
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:42.220]  for the establishment that is a dystopia for us. And we need to get involved and get informed
[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:48.260]  and change society for the better of everybody. And I have no doubt they didn't assassinate
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:53.260]  this Rolling Stone reporter who we now learn was about to break how bad the NSA spying
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:54.060]  was.
[02:13:54.060 --> 02:14:01.060]  Michael Hastings car blew up in front of everybody in Los Angeles. It did not run into a tree.
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:07.120]  And with that incredibly heavy issue, we are joined by someone who's actually on set. And
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:13.200]  we appreciate him taking time off to come on for some humanitarian purposes in a film
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:17.120]  that he's promoting, dealing with just unbelievable horse slaughter.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:22.440]  But he's also dealing with a lot of other social issues and that's Viggo, of course
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:27.920]  Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen of so many huge films. I am a giant fan, my wife is a
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:34.920]  huge fan. Everybody I know is a huge fan and he joins us. Where do you join us from, sir?
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:41.440]  Hi, I'm back in California for the first time in many months. I'm actually at a photo lab.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:47.320]  I'm working on, I have a publishing company too, and I'm fine tuning some images for a
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:48.640]  new publication of ours.
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:51.840]  Yeah, I knew that you'd just been on a plane recently and then we're doing some shoots.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:55.440]  Well, it's great to have you with us. Thank you. Thank you for coming on. There's so much
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:00.720]  to, so much to talk about. I know that you just were given the Dennis Hopper Award at
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.720]  the AM-FM Festival.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:10.600]  Yeah, that was a big honor and it was a lot of fun. The AM-FM inaugural festival down
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:16.160]  in Cathedral City by Palm Springs. It was a good event. A lot of really interesting
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:22.840]  artists and thoughtful people and people I know have a good time too. It was probably
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:29.600]  the most unpretentious film festival or award ceremony I've ever been to. I think it has
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:37.560]  a great future. I think real artists are going to go more and more to that festival, I think.
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.840]  Well, I appreciate you coming on the broadcast to talk about independent festivals, independent
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:48.120]  film, music. I know you're a huge supporter of that. What is your view on the growth of
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:49.360]  independent culture?
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:54.840]  Well, it's always been there and it's always going to be there. It's just how much attention
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:16:00.240]  it gets. When people don't hear about it very much, they think it's dead or they think artists
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:07.560]  have sold out or something, but there's people making original art all the time, interacting
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:13.880]  with each other. The great thing about something like the AM-FM Festival down there is that
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:21.160]  it wasn't just about movies. It was about photographers and painters, sculptors, writers.
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:28.040]  There were these gatherings where people would be on stage or in different venues talking
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:35.600]  about their artwork and getting a lot of ideas from other people working in a different medium
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:43.760]  that can inspire you a lot. I mean, I'm someone who I think that the reason that they offered
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:49.680]  me was not just because I was a friend of Dennis Hopper's and had worked with him in
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:57.040]  a couple of movies, but because we had a life, a long friendship where we shared a lot of
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:03.800]  ideas about painting and art and work together and that, not just acting. And Dennis was
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:08.480]  always curious. Towards the end of his life, he would always want to go see a new artist's
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:14.280]  show or a new independent movie. He was curious. And curiosity is something that we all have
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:21.800]  as kids. It's something that either gets beaten out of you or you somehow become ashamed or
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:27.600]  are led to be ashamed of the way you draw or your ideas or dressing up or playing make-believe
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:34.640]  and all that sort of stuff. And I think the function that artists have is to keep people
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:41.600]  childlike in a positive way, to keep open to the world. I think that apart from traveling
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:48.240]  to different countries or different communities, different parts of your city, I think that
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:56.400]  art is one of the greatest anti-war and anti-poverty weapons there are. When your eyes are open
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:02.520]  and you see how other people live and how other people think and create, it's a lot
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:10.160]  less likely that you're going to be convinced by your army captain or your president or
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:17.080]  your politician that it's a good idea to go bomb this or that country. It's a good idea
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:22.960]  to forget about this or that community or this group of people in your own country.
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.920]  I just think that that's something that kids play together. They don't look at what color
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.800]  the other kid is. They don't judge the other kid's drawing. They say, oh, you drew that?
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:37.680]  Let me draw this. Let me show you what you could add to that drawing or look at this
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:42.800]  thing I found. What do you think of this? And comparing in a positive way, I think that's
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:48.120]  something that kids naturally do. When we get older, I can speak for myself as an artist
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.400]  or as an actor even, they make-believe kids when they're playing when they're five, six,
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:19:00.400]  seven years old and they believe that they're cowboys or princesses or Robin Hood or Lakota
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:05.800]  chiefs or whatever they're doing or Superman or Iron Man. You don't have to direct them.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:09.800]  You don't have to say, let's do another take because I didn't really believe that you were
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:18.520]  convinced yourself. It's that joy of discovery. Yeah. But as actors, when you're an adult,
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:21.640]  you do need to direct them once in a while and say, I didn't believe that. Did you believe
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:27.200]  that? Well, you can do better. Come on. And it's because we get stiff, just like our muscles
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.320]  get stiff. You have to exercise your creative muscles just like you have to exercise your
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:33.320]  body.
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:37.720]  Well, Viggo Mortensen, international superstar, joins us. I know a few people out in Hollywood
[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:41.840]  and they've all told me you are the most down to earth, cool person they know. You speak
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:47.080]  what is it? Six, seven languages. You're a writer, painter, musician. I've seen some
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.560]  of the amazing YouTube interviews you've done and there's so much I want to ask you in the
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.560]  limited time.
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.160]  I want to get into the sequel, Rise of the Renegades, dealing with the insanity of what's
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:01.840]  happening with wild horses with you. But shifting gears, the NSA, what do you make of the fact
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.440]  that just a few years ago people would say, it's a conspiracy theory that they're listening
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:07.440]  to us.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:13.040]  And now we learned they're targeting political dissidents. Aaron Schwartz was being harassed.
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:17.120]  We're learning that they're using the IRS against political groups. Do you think there's
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:22.160]  an awakening happening or do you think that now the system just doesn't care if we know
[02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:24.080]  that we're slaves, basically, Viggo?
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:28.720]  I think that there is an awakening because all these things are being talked about right
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:35.560]  now, today. But, you know, people have very short attention spans nowadays. You know,
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:43.600]  the more gadgets we have, the more phones and apps. And then you started with the onslaught
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:49.240]  of cable TV way back when. And then the Internet. And the more access we have, you would think
[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:52.240]  the more informed we're going to be and the more connected we're going to be with each
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:53.240]  other.
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:58.600]  But people tend to go to the information that supports what they already believe. You know,
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:05.640]  and so people seem to get more disunited and more united, unfortunately. And when I say
[02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:13.640]  short attention span, yeah, the whole stuff about the NSA or about the IRS, about the
[02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:17.080]  drone strikes. I mean, how much are they talking about drone strikes right now? Not really
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:23.560]  at all, but like another fab that just went away in the news cycle. And I think the problem
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:29.800]  is, and I think that politicians count on this, is that people can be swayed. It's like,
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:34.440]  here's a piece of cheese, follow this piece of cheese and go over there and pay attention
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:38.520]  to that for a while while I take care of this other business. The problem with Obama, and
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:43.320]  I support a lot of things about him, I think he's been a very intelligent man. I supported
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:50.360]  him more times. There wasn't much of another option, obviously. But the thing is that the
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:55.200]  people that he appointed, like this started to begin with in 2008, people he announced
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:22:02.600]  that were going to be part of fixing the economic disaster, the push left, were the same people
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:08.080]  that caused the problem on Wall Street, for example. So I didn't expect much there. His
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:15.280]  behavior in foreign policy, whether it be Iraq, Guantanamo, Afghanistan, you know, people
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:20.440]  still think that Afghanistan is a good war. It's not any more of a good war than Iraq
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:28.280]  was. It's not any more of a sensible use of our resources and our young people's lives.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:36.440]  And, you know, not to mention, what about Obama getting a peace prize and then now putting
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:45.280]  al Qaeda in Syria? That's ridiculous. I mean, unfortunately, Obama's government has not
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:52.160]  really been much different than Bush is in a lot of areas and not just in foreign policy.
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:56.840]  Foreign policy is the most egregious, you know, like if we go into if we go into Syria
[02:22:56.840 --> 02:23:04.080]  now to try to help get rid of Assad. People in the Arab world aren't going to say, oh,
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:08.400]  isn't that great, the U.S. is doing something good, because the way they have seen the United
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:13.280]  States, the way they judge the United States is based on how they behave in the Israel-Palestine
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:19.760]  situation, the way they have behaved since 1948. And every single president, including
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:26.160]  Obama, has given special treatment to Israel. And that's obvious to Arab people. So it's
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:31.120]  going to be hard for us to be considered the good guy, which is something that our government
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.120]  and I think our people, we all want people to like us and think, oh, we're the good
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:40.520]  guys. We're the guys from World War II. They handed out candy bars on the streets of Paris
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:45.360]  and Rome. You know, we're the guys with the Marshall Plan. People don't see us that
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:51.920]  way, unfortunately. They see us as the bullies. It's not these Americans that are any nicer
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:57.120]  or less nice than other people in the world, which is people. But our government, which
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:04.000]  represents us, has not been a good player, very rarely has been a good player overseas.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:12.320]  Viggo Mortensen is our guest. Going back to the NSA here, Peter King, Dick Cheney, others
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:16.400]  have called for his arrest. There's been news in the Daily Mail where they're talking
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:25.760]  about killing him. I think that Snowden is a hero leaking the NSA info. Viggo Mortensen,
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:28.440]  what would you like to say on that subject?
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:35.360]  I think he's definitely a very brave person. I also think it's ironic that all the Bush
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:41.760]  team, you know, attack Obama and against Obama for doing exactly the same thing they were
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:51.280]  doing, you know? I mean, it's pretty hypocritical, that behavior. I know this seems like a small
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:55.320]  thing, but it starts locally, you know, activism.
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  Oh, I agree.
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:01.320]  And common sense community activity. I have to say something additionally about the AMF
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:02.320]  Hunt Festival.
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:03.880]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:15.200]  Which is that the mayor of Cathedral City, Kathleen De La Rosa, she did something very
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:21.720]  clever, the government down there, City Council, whatever. They allowed a lot of building,
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:29.080]  you know, as a consequence of what happened in 2008 with the economy and with real estate
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:37.560]  all over the country. There was a lot of retail space that had been built. You know, businesses
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:42.320]  just left there, and there's all this empty space and a lot of communities. And what they
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:48.760]  did in Cathedral City is that they donated or gave very low rent to people who wanted
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:54.800]  to open galleries and art spaces. And those spaces down there are being used in a really
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:59.120]  good way. And it's not just that it's nice to look at or it's good to take the kids to
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:00.120]  see artwork.
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:04.640]  Well, that's what made New York the head of culture worldwide, was in the 30s them doing
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:05.640]  that.
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:12.640]  Exactly. And that proactive stance from the local government down in Cathedral City has
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:17.960]  not just made life richer for people, but it's also improved the economy. There's people
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:22.680]  opening, you know, places to eat. There's a lot of activity down there, rather than
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:26.800]  just being another urban wasteland, you know.
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.120]  That's what's great about what you do, Viggo, is you're so down to earth and you use your
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:35.200]  mind. You're obviously a really smart guy and also you're a celebrity all over the world.
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.880]  You just go around actually trying to help people instead of just going to a photo op
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:42.360]  and doing it. And it's so exciting.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:48.720]  Speaking of the new film, Rise of the Renegades, a sequel to Wild Horses and Renegades, these
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:54.640]  beautiful horses out there. And I saw in write ups of the film, I want to see it. And you're
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:58.360]  out there obviously promoting it, trying to bring attention to this, that they gave the
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:03.480]  horses to a guy who was going to take care of them and get them homes, who was a known
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:05.800]  horse meat guy.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.480]  It's just ridiculous how transparent the government is. Your take on that?
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.080]  Well, it's a long story and you probably don't have time for it, but I do recommend you see
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:26.720]  this movie by James Kleiner. The Bureau of Land Management and the government in Washington
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:36.840]  in general has not had a very good history with wild horses and burros. And a lot of
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:42.280]  attention is being brought to the subject by this film, but also by a lot of other activists.
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:50.440]  Neda DiMaio is a woman who is tireless, probably has done more than anyone else on the subject.
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:56.680]  And it's connected to a lot of other things. You know, one of the reasons that they want
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:01.480]  to get rid of these horses, what happened during the Bush years when Cheney was in charge
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:07.840]  of that, was handing out free passes to corporations, whether it was legal or not, to go into protected
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:15.120]  areas where these horses are to extract resources and building roads when you weren't allowed
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:22.040]  to build roads. And the judicial system was so clogged up with all these violations that
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:27.920]  these people knew that they could go in there and root havoc on our public land, which belonged
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:33.320]  to all Americans, and that it would take years for them to be processed and they could extract
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.760]  the resources, ruin the place, and move on, and probably later start a lot of court or
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:43.560]  something. Now, it's a big problem. There's a lot of issues involved. It's not just about
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.280]  protecting wild horses, which is a great thing in itself.
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:54.480]  So folks need to see the film. I encourage people to see the film and just put Google,
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:29:00.920]  put wild horses or wild horses preservation. Do a little homework. That's the great thing
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:04.440]  about the internet. If you use it wisely, you can learn a lot of things. I mean, I learn
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:08.920]  things every day from it. But, you know, as far as the news, the things that you talk
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:14.560]  about on your program all the time, you know, your listeners will often, I'm sure, be surprised
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:18.720]  that really that's what's going on. And then they'll go look it up. When I say that people
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:22.000]  tend to go to what they already know, it's what they do. You know, you go look at the
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:28.080]  news about your sports team, not others. Well, they go, my broadcast, listen to CNN or the
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:34.320]  Fox, or you'll listen to and watch MSNBC or whatever. You'll listen to your show only.
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:38.240]  I think it's good to, I try to read papers. I totally agree. Vigo, do five more minutes
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:43.800]  with us on the other side. Sure. Sure. Fantastic. And guys, let's boost our audio to him. I
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:46.800]  can tell he's having trouble hearing us because I've been a guest on my own show before he
[02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:52.360]  can barely hear. We're right back with Vigo. Stay with us. We're on the March, the empires

[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:20.000]  I was told that he heard the show sometimes and I was talking to him during the break
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.560]  that that is the case. I'm very flattered as I am a huge fan of his work and the rumor
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:28.680]  was out there last year. I just asked him during the break, Vigo, you were offered the
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:35.960]  part of Zod and didn't take it. I wasn't available at the time. Unfortunately, it probably would
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:40.520]  have been a lot of fun to play that part. Although I have a lot of respect for Terrence
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:46.640]  Sams portrayal, I got to say. Oh yeah, I saw him in the Iceman chilling. He's an incredible
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:54.160]  actor. He's very good. Yeah, he can do everything. You know, you just try to follow your instincts
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:34:00.520]  and you know, my philosophy is prepare the best you can for accidents to happen because
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:07.040]  they always will. And something good can come out of an obstacle all week. Oh, who knows?
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:10.880]  Absolutely. But I would love to see you, see you play a villain. I mean, I've seen you
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:15.480]  play like mobsters trying to be reformed and things. Have I missed a film where you're
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:22.320]  a villain? Well, I played Lucifer once in a movie called The Prophecy. That's right.
[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:29.040]  I saw that. Chris Walken. Yeah, that's a good movie. You never know. I mean, I just try
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:36.520]  to follow my nose. You know, if I like a story, I'll go do it. I don't really think about
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:42.400]  the budget or where it's being shot or anything. And you know, fortunately since I can speak
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:47.560]  more than one language, I've been able to work the last couple of years. I did two really
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:51.480]  interesting movies down in Argentina. One that came out recently here called Everyone
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:56.240]  Has a Plan, where I play twin brothers who don't like each other very much. That was
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:01.920]  an interesting kind of thriller. And you know, I might go do a movie that's set in a very
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:06.480]  interesting... Have you ever seen a movie called Battle of Algiers by Punta Corvo?
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:11.400]  I love that movie. It's almost like a documentary. You're watching it and you think it's real.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:15.920]  Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's set during the fight for independence in Algeria from France,
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:23.080]  which has been a colonial occupier for 130 years. And imagine if the United States had
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:30.000]  stayed in Iraq for 130 years straight. That's how fed up the people were there. But it was
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.200]  a complicated subject. Anyway, there's a movie that's being shot that takes place during
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:43.480]  that period, late 50s, in North Africa. There's Paul and Uma back in that one. But I gotta
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:46.360]  bone up a little because I have to speak French and Arabic.
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:48.360]  I can't wait to see that.
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:52.000]  Well, I hope it gets over here. The problem is those little movies have a hard time getting
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.720]  destroyed over here. But you know, I figure if you do your best, you do a good job, eventually
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:35:58.720]  it'll get seen somewhere.
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:03.040]  Well, we're seeing a resurgence of arthouse films because of the smaller theaters. I just
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:09.420]  love it. Moving quickly, because I know you've got to go. Bob Anderson, the greatest swordmaster
[02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:15.280]  ever who died last year, said you were the greatest swordsman he ever trained. And I
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:19.360]  think he said not just in movies. I mean, how good are you with a sword, Viggo?
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:24.360]  Well, I'm probably a little rusty now, but that's high praise coming from Bob Anderson.
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:34.480]  He's a legend in Swordmaster Circle. He was something else. He's been in movies. He was
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:40.880]  in the Olympics. That's how he started out. He was a fencing champion and a great person.
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:45.840]  He was an incredible teacher. Very strict sometimes, but he had a good sense of humor.
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:51.720]  And he was tough, but he was fair. And I learned a lot from him. He's the one who taught me
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:55.160]  to do all the fighting for Lord of the Rings. That's where I met him. And then I subsequently
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:37:03.240]  did a period movie, I think Spanish epic, 17th century, where we fought with two blades,
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:05.880]  you know, with rapier and dagger.
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:10.920]  So bottom line, don't get in a knife fight with Viggo Mortensen. I want to give out the
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:15.640]  name of your publishing company, where you also publish a lot of photos, articles, videos,
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:19.760]  things you're doing. I've been at the site before, so many great things on there. It's
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:25.680]  percivalpress.com, and we'll email that out at The Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:28.240]  Going back to what you said right before the break, and then I've got one other question,
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:31.720]  and I'll let you get out of here, Viggo. You're a sweetheart to come on with us, your busy
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:36.160]  schedule. You were talking about getting outside the box. Google admits they now on YouTube
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:44.320]  tries to keep you in what they think you like, and they admit to balkanize the population.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:45.920]  And I agree with you, the greatest solution-
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:48.160]  How do they do that?
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:54.120]  They take what your surfing history already is, and they admit that if you're searching
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:59.640]  or on YouTube or anything they own, then they try to keep you on a digital plantation of
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:01.880]  only what you're already into.
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:07.440]  Yeah, it's true that you have to push yourself. I mean, it's the same as getting off the couch
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.320]  and at least going for a walk. It's not always the first thing you want to do. You'd maybe
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:18.600]  rather stay on the couch and eat another bag of chips, but you know it's good for you to
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:23.440]  get out and go for a run or go for a walk or go talk to somebody, get off the phone,
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:28.200]  get away from the TV and so forth once in a while, or regularly. And it's the same with
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.120]  looking for, if you're curious about what's going on in your community and what's going
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:39.040]  on in the world, you've got to make an extra effort. Go listen to people and read people
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:45.680]  that you know you probably won't agree with, just to get the other side of it. Make up
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:54.240]  your own mind because the left, the right, all journalists, all commentators have their
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:59.800]  motivation. Get out of the rut, get out of the rut, expand.
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:03.960]  Make up your own mind, but you've got to make an effort. It's not just going to be handed
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:08.120]  to you by a computer without you making an effort to go look elsewhere.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.920]  Wow, Vigo, amazing. In closing, most horror movies, I'm not a horror fan. I like science
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:19.520]  fiction that has some violence in it or whatever, just because that makes it more real. But
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:25.240]  since I was a child, no movies have scared me. And I've seen movies before that are action
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:27.520]  adventure and I want to watch them again.
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:34.680]  The road touched me like no other film I've ever seen. And because I've studied history
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.760]  and things and had some experiences, it's so real. And I know within 10 days, most people
[02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:48.760]  become cannibals in Pentagon studies. In closing, that's a film that I am physically afraid
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:55.360]  to watch again because of almost the ancestral fears that it rises.
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:40:00.780]  And what if there's a nuclear war? What of our atmosphere? The road, what can you say
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:01.780]  about that?
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:07.840]  Well, it's true. It's a harrowing experience to watch it, but it's also beautifully made.
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:14.680]  And John Hill directed that movie and John did a great job with a tough subject matter.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:21.080]  And as a boy in it, Cody's dignity is now, he's over six feet tall. He's a man now, but
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:26.680]  he was fantastic in that movie. And it's unfortunate that at the last minute they decided
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:31.720]  not to distribute it as widely as they were going to. But like I say, good work eventually
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:39.200]  gets seen. And a lot of people on the street, as many people comment on that movie as they
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:46.920]  do any other movie, they really touch the nerve. And it's kind of, like you say, it's
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.320]  a good warning in a way. Like if we don't want that to be that way, you gotta take an
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:52.320]  action.
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:59.080]  Well, the most touching part is, in closing, is when Robert Duvall, you and your son are
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:05.840]  there, and he explains that boy's a god. In this ugly, destroyed world, he doesn't say
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:11.080]  that, but that's what I got in the poetry, is that this youth, this energy, the creativity,
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:18.040]  the green shoots in a dead world, children are our future. And I mean, what did you take
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:20.160]  away by that writing?
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:26.320]  Yeah, beautiful. I mean, I would paraphrase in a way what he was saying, or how I would
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:34.160]  put it is, children are God, pay attention. That doesn't mean spoil your kid, or it doesn't
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:37.840]  mean that you're talking specifically about the kids, but remember what you felt when
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:43.680]  you were a kid. Remember your creative instincts, remember your instincts for peace, remember
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:51.000]  your instincts for fellowship, and for making something beautiful out of life, not destroying
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  the world and not destroying the lives of others, as adults often do, unfortunately.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.840]  So remember kids, remember yourself as a kid, and you're gonna be on the right track.
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:07.080]  Well Viggo Mortensen, you are a beautiful person and I hope to meet you someday in person.
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:10.560]  God bless you for sharing your time with us, and for trying to help humanity, you're an
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:14.080]  example to us all, and I look forward to speaking to you again.
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:15.400]  Thank you very much for your time.
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:23.800]  Thank you, Viggo. Wow, that was a powerful interview. That is really amazing, and it's
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:28.880]  amazing to know that we've touched Viggo, that he listens to the show, and it's just
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:33.600]  another example of how many amazing people there are out there that know what's happening.
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:38.240]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, I've read too many accounts of war and collab society
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:40.120]  seeing something like The Road.
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:49.000]  That movie, it's like Godfather 1, where it's like it's real, or the battle for Algiers
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:55.360]  he mentioned. You watch that and you think it's a documentary, it's done so good. And
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:01.480]  there's parts of Godfather where it's not magic like that. The road is magic from the
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:05.520]  start to the end, and Viggo is a artist.
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:12.280]  Oh, man, I'm having a good day right now. I'm talking to Viggo off air too, man, that
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:18.280]  is awesome. That is awesome, and we're influencing him, he's influencing us, and he explained,
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:21.280]  we guys bring the chair in and bring the next guest in who I apologize to. Is he here or
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:26.680]  is he doing the interview with Giacari? He's here, let's bring in our guest who I apologize
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:29.000]  moving him so Viggo could come on.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.560]  I heard last week that Viggo would be happy to come on, but then he had to go down to
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:41.000]  Argentina and he was coming back, so he couldn't do the video interview. And he as well doesn't
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  do interviews when he's in character shooting a film. And then I said, whatever, if he wants
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.800]  to come on, we'll hear from him. And we heard from him this morning, and so that happened.
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:55.400]  And next time I'm out in LA, and he's out there, I'm invited out to LA a lot, I still
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.600]  have time to go out there. I need to get out to LA, there's a lot of unfinished business.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:04.800]  The Joe Rogan podcast, a bunch of TV interviews I gotta do, a couple people I gotta meet with,
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:10.760]  and people like Viggo Mortensen, that is just unbelievable. Because I could care less about
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:15.480]  getting some Hollywood star on that I don't admire, and I don't admire many of them. But
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:19.760]  that's the guy that turned down the role for Zod, I mean, think about that.
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:25.200]  I gotta tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I need to get my folder on our next guest. We're
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:29.760]  gonna go into overdrive with, and who I wanna apologize to, but I think he can understand
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:35.800]  getting moved for Viggo Mortensen. This guy I'm a fan of, I see him do these open carry
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:40.520]  demonstrations, I see him on the news, I see him in town hall debates nationally and locally.
[02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:44.600]  And this is a guy who is a leader, Michael Cargill, and he lives here in Austin, I'll
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:45.600]  just do it right here on air.
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:48.320]  But you're gonna have to kind of chase us cuz we get so busy we forget. I'd like to
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:55.240]  invite you once a week to come in and do a gun report for us. Hell of a way to meet you,
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:59.440]  I'm like, get in here and come work for us right now. Michael Cargill, and of course,
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:06.000]  he's one of the honchos over there at centraltexasgunworks.com.
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.520]  And he spent 12 years in the US Army and studied criminal justice at Detroit State University.
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.080]  And while he was in the Army, he was awarded the Army Commendations Medals, eight Army
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:17.200]  Achievement Medals, and four Army Good Conduct Medals. I'm not gonna go through this whole
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:18.960]  bio, we'll run out of time with him.
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:23.880]  He's a qualified expert marksman, both in rifle and hand grenades, and is an airborne
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.560]  qualified parachutist. And I hope he doesn't send to assassinate me, I'm joking, we were
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.440]  talking about the Army earlier. And after his honorable discharge, he works in telecommunications
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.440]  and now works in the Second Amendment and everything else. And he just does a lot of
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:38.960]  amazing work managing huge accounts.
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:42.540]  I'm not gonna get into your whole bio, it's a very interesting bio. And we're just excited
[02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:49.280]  to have you here. You're a NRA certified safety range instructor, officer. And just defend
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:54.840]  the Second Amendment's while we've got you here. And it's very exciting to see us defeating
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:59.080]  their last raft of gun grabbing, but I'm concerned after the next event, they're gonna come after
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:00.220]  us yet again.
[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:02.040]  So Michael Cargill, good to have you here, sir.
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:04.120]  Thank you, sir, thank you for having me, I really appreciate that.
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.920]  You bet, we're gonna have you on the Nightly News with Jackari Jackson at 92 as well. So
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:13.760]  again, wow, so much going on. What would you say is the state of our Second Amendment?
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:18.320]  I tell you, well, we have a serious problem here, especially after the midterm elections.
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:24.920]  I actually expect this current administration to come after our Second Amendments again,
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:25.920]  for sure.
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:32.080]  Yeah, they've said, I mean, don't pause or I'll talk over you the whole time, man. The
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:37.600]  gargoyle up there, Senator Feinstein said, there will be other events and work, and then
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:38.600]  she smiled.
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:42.840]  Right, right, and see, the reason I got into this business in the first place is back when
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:47.120]  I was in the military, my grandmother at 70 years old decided that she was gonna travel
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:51.400]  back to college to get a college degree. My grandmother only got a high school education,
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:53.560]  so at 70, she wanted to become a nurse.
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:56.900]  And while my grandmother was traveling back from a college library sitting at a bus stop
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:47:00.680]  waiting for a bus to come, a guy came along, mugged her and raped her.
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:01.680]  My gosh.
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:05.360]  And I decided at that point that I would make sure that every female in my family had the
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:06.640]  tools they need to protect themselves.
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:08.240]  Is that scumbag in prison?
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:12.200]  No, he is not, unfortunately. But we, I think-
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:14.200]  He's not gonna fall down and hit his head, is he?
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:15.200]  No.
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:16.200]  If anybody rips my grandmother, they're gonna-
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:22.120]  Right, right, I know. And I just want to empower women to defend themselves because they can't
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:24.360]  have a police officer on their backs 24-
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:28.480]  Exactly, these feminists are against women having guns. They're not feminists, they're
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:29.480]  scum.
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:34.360]  Exactly, 100%. And so that's why I support the Second Amendment. I support all our constitutional
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:36.760]  rights, but I really, I'm pushing for the Second Amendment.
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:40.120]  Well, there's also this thing with women that they go, I wouldn't be good with guns. Women,
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:43.960]  as you know, statistically are as good or better than men with guns.
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:45.160]  Right, and I'm totally-
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:46.640]  Have you found that as an instructor?
[02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:51.960]  Oh, yeah, oh, yes. We get, it takes me about two minutes to get, I sit there and talk to
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:57.900]  a lady and coach her into what to do, what to look for, and then bam, she hits it, hits
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:01.120]  it right out of the park, and it will do a lot better than the men in our class.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:05.520]  Well, that's what we see in Olympic shooting. They're as good as the best men at shooting,
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:07.880]  and just generally, women are easier to train in firearms.
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:10.440]  Right, right, I agree 100%, yeah.
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:16.920]  Oh, I tell you, we had, it doesn't matter, we had a rock star's daughter out with a shooting
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:21.640]  out of Steiner Ranch, the real Steiner Ranch, and she was shooting bullseye at 300 yards
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:26.400]  with a Lapua that we hadn't even sighted in properly immediately. And we were all shooting
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:30.040]  around it till we got it sighted in. It's like instinct, she was shooting even though
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.040]  it wasn't sighted in properly.
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:32.040]  Right.
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:33.760]  We were like, how are you doing this?
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:40.000]  Yeah, I tell people, it takes me about, I don't know, nine hours and 45 minutes to actually
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.840]  sit there and talk to a person and teach them how not to pull that gun out, but it takes
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:48.080]  me all of a good five minutes to actually teach them the action specifics of-
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:52.320]  Exactly, a good gun trainer will teach you when to use the gun, that's the key.
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:53.320]  Right.
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:57.920]  But they've mystified guns. Like in these movies where you shoot a.357 and it blows
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:02.160]  you back. I mean, I can shoot 250 cals standing up. It's hard to pick them up, but if I can
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:03.600]  pick them up, I can shoot them both.
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:08.320]  Correct, and they always focus on the wrong things. They're focusing on targeting lawful
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:12.320]  gun owners rather than just the criminals. And it's about getting rid of these criminals
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:18.000]  and empowering the people. It's not like where the president is from, Chicago, Illinois.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:22.120]  They call it Land of Lincoln, I like to call it Land of the Lawless. Those failed gun laws
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:27.080]  in Connecticut didn't work for them in Connecticut. The failed gun laws in Chicago, Illinois,
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:30.080]  not working for them there, and they're not going to work for us here in Texas.
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:35.400]  Man, I don't know who these guys are that go around raping women. I mean, how does it
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:38.680]  even come in your mind to want to do that? And I just want to see them all get killed.
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:39.680]  Right.
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:43.060]  I mean, let me tell you, somebody does something to my wife, they're going to get a snub nose
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:46.760]  .357 pulled out, jammed in their chest, and they're dead.
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:52.080]  Right, right. And it's important that we educate our community and how to-
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:57.080]  To empower themselves, to protect themselves, because we shouldn't need law enforcement
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.560]  to hover over us and protect us. I want government to get out of our business, get out of the
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:05.120]  people's business, and government should be transparent so we can see what's going on
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:07.800]  with government, but then the people's business should be private.
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:13.000]  Absolutely. Well, listen, I want you to reenact what I saw you in like a town hall that was
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:16.240]  local but then it went national, and you were in there just tearing them up the other day.
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:17.240]  That was you I saw, right?
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:18.240]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:21.120]  Okay, I'm just remembering because I said, get that guy. I'm always saying, get him.
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:25.760]  I haven't got him yet. They're like, your car interviews him all the time. So I'm like,
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:28.800]  so here you are. What do you want to talk about when we come back? Because I'll consider
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:30.280]  and ask questions all day.
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:36.160]  Right. Well, I think we need to get our federal government to focus on the correct things.
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:39.900]  Stop focusing on universal background checks. As a gun store owner, I actually should be
[02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:43.840]  in support of universal background checks, but I'm against universal background checks.
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:47.600]  I'm against having the federal government get involved in private sales.
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:50.920]  That's right. I should add, you're the owner of Central Texas Gun Works, aren't you?
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:51.920]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:56.120]  And that's a great outfit. I never have time to go up there, but I'm going to do it. centraltexasgunworks.com
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:51:01.280]  if you're in Central Texas, get over there and get some shooting in today.

[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  Well, Michael Cargill is the American dream. He's got a big shooting range, big gun store,
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:41.760]  very popular, one of the most successful people in Central Texas. And you can go to CentralTexasGunWorks.com
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:47.400]  and also CargillforConstable.com. What's going on with that?
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:51.440]  We're actually not running the Constable race anymore. That was something that we did last
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:52.440]  year.
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:53.440]  To educate people.
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:57.960]  Right, we were actually running against Adon Ballesteros, AKA the cocaine Constable. And
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:03.080]  he actually, when he used to work for DPS, he allowed 4,000 kilograms of cocaine to cross
[02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:07.680]  over from Mexico to the United States. So DPS actually fired him. And then he actually
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:14.600]  got a job for the Constable and then eventually ran for Constable. And so we actually ran
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:16.160]  against him in that election.
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:23.160]  But since I ran as a Democrat, and since I was a Second Amendment supporter, the local
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:28.200]  leadership in the Democratic Party decided that they were not going to support me in
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:29.720]  that race because of my stand.
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:30.720]  Disgusting.
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:31.720]  Right, my Second Amendment stand.
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:33.360]  Doesn't matter though, you got to expose them.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:34.360]  Right.
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:35.360]  That's what matters.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  Yes, so we expose them.
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:39.320]  That's what it's about. I mean, a lot of times running is about getting on the news and fighting
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:40.320]  the new world order.
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:41.320]  Right.
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:43.320]  What is your view on politics worldwide?
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:50.200]  Well, I think we need to get out. The President promised that our people would actually, our
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:54.040]  troops will return home. He will bring the troops home, and he has not held up to that
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:55.040]  promise.
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:57.760]  They're still in Iraq, and they say they withdrew. They didn't.
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:01.040]  Yes, and we need to return our troops back to the United States. We need to take care
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:02.840]  of the United States, take care of our people here.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:04.320]  You're like a Ron Ball type guy, right?
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.320]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:07.440]  I've heard you on the radio and stuff. I just don't want to speak for you.
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:08.440]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:10.280]  You're like in the extremist club, basically.
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:11.280]  Well, you know.
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:14.440]  You love freedom. Mom and apple pie, you're a bad guy.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:18.600]  Well, my motto is, you know, when they come for your guns, give them your bullets.
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.240]  Absolutely, and that's why we're fighting so hard. You know, for me, it's the line in
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.560]  the sand. It's slavery. I mean, I'm not bringing this up because you're black. I bring it up
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:27.560]  all the time.
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:30.840]  The first gun laws, as you know, were against black people in the South after the Civil
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:35.680]  War on record, and then they have all these commentators on BET and CNN and Fox, black
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:42.480]  and white and Hispanic, saying the NRA is the Klan. And I mean, where do they? That's
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:43.800]  the opposite of the reality.
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:49.120]  Oh, no, exactly. The exact opposite. The National Rights Association focuses on training. They
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:53.560]  may not be as extreme as some people would like them to be because they're trying to
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:55.120]  work that political process.
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:56.120]  They're sure not the Klan.
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:58.160]  Exactly. They're not the KKK.
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:02.840]  But I mean, that's obvious. I don't know why they don't. I'm not a shoe guy, but at a certain
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:06.880]  point you got to sue people. I mean, I'm surprised Fox hadn't been sued for them having their
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:11.000]  people on there saying the NRA is the Klan and wants to kill black people. How do you
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.880]  come up with that?
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:16.460]  The people they need to focus on is the current administration because this administration
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:20.400]  wants to come up with universal background checks. When you do universal background checks,
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:24.160]  what that's going to do is, first of all, we have over a million people that are locked
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.080]  up in jail right now in this country. Out of that million people, the majority of them
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:29.600]  are African Americans.
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:33.700]  So when you come up with any new laws, new gun laws, those laws are going to focus on
[02:57:33.700 --> 02:57:34.700]  that community.
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:35.700]  You know they are.
[02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:38.460]  Exactly. You're going to give the police more power to come out of those people and put
[02:57:38.460 --> 02:57:40.000]  more blacks in jail.
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.440]  Who need the guns to protect themselves.
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:45.200]  That is correct. So this president will actually be the person that is more responsible for
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:48.240]  putting more black people in jail instead of doing the exact opposite.
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:51.320]  Look at what he's doing with AFRICOM invading Africa. They're not there to help. I'll tell
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:52.320]  you that.
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:53.840]  You're absolutely right.
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:57.120]  It's unbelievable what they get away with. I tell you, it is unbelievable. And not that
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:01.280]  I like John McCain or, you know, the other guys that he ran against meant Romney. It's
[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:06.200]  that there's no choice. It just gets worse and worse. But with Obama, this is a guy raised
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:07.200]  by the weatherman.
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:12.440]  I mean, it's just creepy, right? And you got to be careful because one of his big supporters
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:17.300]  is a gun guy. You know, he's, he's being supported by a gun manufacturer. So you got to be careful
[02:58:17.300 --> 02:58:18.300]  with that too.
[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:19.300]  Who is?
[02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:21.560]  The president is one of his big supporters.
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:22.560]  Who is that?
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:24.840]  Oh man, I can't even think of the name right now. I apologize.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:29.280]  No, I forgot. I remember reading that. I forgot. You forgot. That's why I was asking you.
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:33.120]  Michael Cargill is coming up. We're going to take your phone calls all over the map,
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:37.760]  but then let's get some gun calls in here. Very exciting to have a pro second amendment

[02:59:07.940 --> 02:59:12.260]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really

[03:00:25.400 --> 03:00:33.080]  We've got second amendment advocate par excellent Michael Cargill of centraltexasgunworks.com.
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:42.520]  And I know the callers been holding before Viggo Mortensen was on Aragorn of Arathorn,
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:46.400]  but we are going to go to your phone calls. A mouse link who's been patiently holding
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:52.100]  on to get his comment and questions. Melinda Frank, Aaron will be all over the map and
[03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:56.140]  then we'll open the phones up for everybody that calls in after that for second amendment
[03:00:56.140 --> 03:01:01.800]  points with our guests. But Michael, I was riveted by the town hall meeting I saw you
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:05.680]  and you were really tearing those people up and I love how they take a few anti gun politicians
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:09.680]  and call them moms against guns like moms are against guns.
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:13.800]  They're not against the government having guns. No, and the main goal of these people
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:18.920]  were is actually to strip us of our gun rights. You know, we asked a young lady that was sitting
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:22.720]  next to me, you know, what were some of the things that she wanted to do? And she said
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:28.140]  her main thing is she didn't believe that anyone should be able to have access to firearms.
[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:34.120]  So there's, you know, and what do you say to a person like that? You know, and I told
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:39.040]  her that some of the things that we need to focus on, as far as Travis County in the state
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:44.760]  of Texas, we need to focus on, you know, I get a person that will walk into my gun store
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:49.280]  and that person would want to sell me a gun. And then do you know that there's no way for
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:54.000]  a gun store to verify if that gun stolen or not? You know, so those are some of the things
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:57.440]  they need to focus on. They're always focusing on the wrong things. They're always focusing
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:01:59.240]  on individuals and privacy rights.
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:02.920]  Well, that's because they're all getting kickbacks out of it. That's what the pawn shops are
[03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:07.600]  for. I mean, I can drive down a mile from here and show you drugs being sold. Cops drive
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:08.600]  right by it.
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:14.120]  Right, right. And it's funny you say that because I actually, you know, contacted, you
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:19.360]  know, the local law enforcement. I also contacted the mayor's office and said, hey, you know,
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:24.040]  what can we do about this problem with someone walking into the gun store and wanting to
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.560]  sell a gun and me, a gun store owner, being able to verify that gun is stolen or not?
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:33.800]  While that person is standing right there at the counter, I can actually call the local
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:34.800]  law enforcement.
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:38.400]  They don't want to make citizens proactive to then call and check and see if it's stolen
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:40.360]  to shut down the stolen gun market.
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:41.360]  Exactly.
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:42.360]  They don't want real solutions.
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:43.360]  Exactly, no.
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:44.520]  Why do they want us to live like in Chicago?
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:48.320]  Honestly, I do not know. And, you know, next thing they're going to do is they're going
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:50.040]  to, what, send National Guard into Chicago.
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:51.440]  Yeah, they're saying that now.
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:52.440]  Right.
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:55.520]  I interrupted you. I'm bad about that. What did the city council do when you wanted a
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:02:56.520]  real plan?
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:02:59.920]  Well, I let them, you know, I told them here, here's our situation. Here's what's going
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:04.440]  on. You know, a pawn shop, they have rules. They do certain things, but a gun store, you
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:08.720]  walk into a gun store, you try to sell a gun, the gun store, you know, can't tell, you know,
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:11.980]  the local law enforcement and verify that serial number to see if that gun is using
[03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:15.280]  a crime or reported as stolen or anything like that.
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:19.280]  And the, you know, the response I got was, I'm sorry, I know you're trying to run an
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:23.160]  honest business, but there's nothing that we can do about it.
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:26.800]  And again, they should just have a program where stolen guns, people can tell the police,
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:28.800]  put it in a database.
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:29.800]  Right.
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:33.040]  And do you ever have what look like meth heads or crack heads come in that are obviously
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:36.360]  super seedy, have a weird story and you refuse to buy a gun?
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:40.480]  Yes, we've had that situation happen probably about a month ago. Young man walked into the
[03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:44.000]  store and he was really high strong and he wanted to buy a gun. He actually wanted to
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.720]  buy a gun to kill somebody. And he actually told that to someone down the street there
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:52.600]  in a sporting goods store and they sent him to us.
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:58.080]  And so when he walked into the shop, my staff actually contacted me and I hit the sound
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:01.360]  alarm. We had the police show up and they actually pulled him out and sent him to do
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:07.760]  a medical eval done. But that does happen, you know, and it's up to, it's our responsibility
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:13.320]  as citizens to, you know, protect us, you know, from things like that.
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:14.600]  Obviously out of his mind. Right.
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:16.800]  Walking in, I'm going to go, I need a gun to kill somebody.
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:17.800]  Right.
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:18.800]  And then send them to you.
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:19.800]  Right.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:20.800]  Oh no, don't do, go to him.
[03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:21.800]  Cowards.
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:22.800]  See.
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:23.800]  Right.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:26.320]  That's another thing. Most people are such cowards now are not all everybody, but a large
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:30.600]  segment that they just never stand up to bad guys. So they just run rampant.
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:35.600]  Yes, sir. I agree with you 100%. So that's why it's up to the people, you know, to protect
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:41.080]  ourselves. We need to arm the people in. And it's like I said, when they come for your
[03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:44.080]  guns, I say, give them your bullets.
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:46.960]  What does the guy do when I want to hear when the cops shut up? What did you do?
[03:04:46.960 --> 03:04:50.520]  Well, when they showed up, they actually pulled them outside. When they pulled them outside,
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:54.560]  about 10, you know, officers showed up. Someone else in his family showed up. There's a big
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:58.600]  fight outside in the parking lot. Not in my shop. It's up to me to make sure that the
[03:04:58.600 --> 03:04:59.760]  people in my shop, in my car.
[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:03.600]  I want to hear this. Hold on. We're going to break introducing pro wine, all of your

[03:08:01.240 --> 03:08:07.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:29.240]  a war on for your mind.
[03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:35.200]  Michael Cargill heads up centraltexasgunworks.com. It's in South Austin right off of Ben White
[03:08:35.200 --> 03:08:39.880]  right by Chuck E. Cheese. Got a bunch of Marine Corps former instructors in there and all
[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:44.040]  I hear is great stuff. In fact, he's like, yeah, we cleaned a couple of your 50 cals.
[03:08:44.040 --> 03:08:47.360]  We're a big gunsmith too. And I never have time to mess with this stuff. Weldon took
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.080]  him in there. Those are some pretty rifles, huh?
[03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:54.200]  Oh yeah. Didn't want to test them for you.
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:55.520]  So you liked them?
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:08:56.920]  Oh yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[03:08:56.920 --> 03:09:00.020]  All right. Well, it's good to have you here with us. We've got callers calling in that
[03:09:00.020 --> 03:09:03.760]  are all over the map and I want to go to some of them, but more about that town hall I saw
[03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:09.480]  you on TV with last week and how they use this playbook. I mean, this is all about disarming
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:10.480]  us.
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:16.060]  Did you see the video we got of the mayor pro team at the Capitol where people had signs
[03:09:16.060 --> 03:09:19.680]  saying no gun ban? He said, listen, after we get them registered, you're going to need
[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:24.720]  that sign. Then we will confiscate them, but we're not doing that now. That's next. Feinstein,
[03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:26.000]  all of them are on record.
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:31.240]  They want our guns and they're so disingenuous when they're on CNN going, we don't want your
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:35.920]  guns. I mean, it should be game over. They're disingenuous. And I think that's why they're
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:39.720]  losing their gun control debate because people know they're a pack of scum, right? They're
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:44.160]  actually traveling around the country trying to find out different ways to come after individual
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:45.160]  firearms.
[03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:49.200]  And I tell them, focus on the things that you can actually control. You know, those
[03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:52.400]  little things, you know, why don't you go after the, where the criminals located, you
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:56.200]  know, we don't need gun control. We actually need criminal control, you know, and I'm not
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:09:59.600]  cause I'm not giving you my farms. You're not going to get them. You come out to my
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:02.480]  farms, you knock on my door and I'm just, I'm giving you my bullets first.
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:08.960]  Which 50 Cal do you like the, uh, the Navy version or the, uh, army standard? I liked
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:12.240]  the Navy version. That was actually pretty nice. Well, we got to take you out shooting
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:16.960]  sometime, man. Yes, sir. I'm just so busy. I want to do the gun show. I shot like three
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:21.460]  shoots with the Steiners. Three great videos coming out soon. It's going to be about us
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:23.440]  out there with 50 cows around to figure them out.
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:27.340]  Never shooting those particular ones. Uh, I had them for a long time. Now the price
[03:10:27.340 --> 03:10:33.760]  has gone up so much. Thank God I got them a while back. Uh, but if Obama has done anything,
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:37.040]  they have certainly woken people up and I think it's backfired on them.
[03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:41.580]  Yes. Cause they're not focusing on safety. They're actually focusing on, you know, taking
[03:10:41.580 --> 03:10:46.680]  people's second amendment rights. It's about control and not about safety at all. They
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:51.440]  focus on the safety aspects of it. They focus on the things that they can do within the
[03:10:51.440 --> 03:10:57.520]  ATF and the FBI. Um, in that system, uh, focus on mental health. Those are the things that
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:00.880]  they can actually control, but they're not focusing on that. They actually want to just
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:05.200]  go after individuals guns and like a person gets deployed overseas. You know, we're, you
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:08.680]  know, instead of sending troops home, you know, we've got police, I'm sorry, troops
[03:11:08.680 --> 03:11:13.780]  deployed around this world. And when, when our troops come back, they're actually labeling
[03:11:13.780 --> 03:11:18.060]  them with PTSD and then once they label them with PTSD, then they want to take the farms
[03:11:18.060 --> 03:11:22.520]  away from them and then all of a sudden go back and redeploy them again. But take your
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:27.720]  firearm away from you while you're at home, but you're okay to fight when you're overseas.
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:32.320]  That is unbelievable. I've seen that. Yes. Well, look, I mean, any corrupt regime wants
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:36.000]  to go after the veterans. Hitler did it. Yes. He had nine of the long knives where he went
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:40.840]  after hundreds of thousands of soldiers and people. And this is what the Stalin did that.
[03:11:40.840 --> 03:11:45.720]  Lenin did that. Mao did that. I mean, the police and military better be the first ones
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:49.840]  to figure out that they better get on board with the people and just say no to tyranny.
[03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:55.760]  And I see that happening between 40 and 50% of the troops I run into are listeners and
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:59.420]  they say most of the people in their units are awake to the new world order. What are
[03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:03.760]  you hearing? I mean, the exact same thing. We need to bring our troops home. We need
[03:12:03.760 --> 03:12:09.280]  to pay attention to what's going on, going on in our federal government. Listen to what,
[03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:13.500]  you know, your, your commander in chief is saying, bring our troops home, bring them
[03:12:13.500 --> 03:12:16.760]  home. That's all I can stress enough. Bring them home.
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:20.720]  But the globalists have a problem with the military's awake. And how is it going to fly
[03:12:20.720 --> 03:12:25.640]  saying the troops are the number one terror threat with no evidence of that in these new
[03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:31.580]  training manuals? No, I disagree with that. But it's asinine. It's like saying Mary Poppins
[03:12:31.580 --> 03:12:36.880]  is the terror threat. Right? No, no. How about the crooks and government saying that are
[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:41.920]  the problem? Yes, government's definitely going to be the problem. Like I said, government
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:45.200]  should be transparent. We need to be able to see what government is doing. And the people's
[03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:50.280]  business should be private. Amazing. What is your concern? Because I know you're really
[03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:53.720]  on this issue at the Capitol. I mean, that's why I like it. I always see you popping up.
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:13:00.080]  You're the lead fighting this tyranny. And they're trying to now just label people to
[03:13:00.080 --> 03:13:04.720]  take our rights away. How do you think they're going to come at us next time? Well, just
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:08.640]  like we were talking about with the town hall meeting, you have a situation where a young
[03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:14.280]  man was at the Virginia Tech shooting. And the guy walks in, you know, the madman walks
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:21.440]  into the room and starts shooting. Well, he didn't get shot. So he picks up the only weapon
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:26.720]  that he had, which was his cell phone. He dials 911 on his cell phone. The shooter leaves
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:31.180]  the room, goes into a different room, shoots people in that room. And he's on the phone
[03:13:31.180 --> 03:13:37.120]  for about 20 minutes with the 911 operator. The shooter comes back into the room, starts
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:41.840]  shooting again. Only thing he could do is turn around and run. So he gets shot in the
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:48.320]  rear, trying to run from the shooter. As he goes down, a girl next to him grabs his phone
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:52.320]  and talks to the 911 operator for quite a while. The shooter leaves the room, goes out
[03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:57.840]  the room. The shooter comes back to the room, continues shooting. And they will sit here
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:14:01.280]  and they will tell you that they don't think that a concealed handgun license holder would
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:03.840]  have been able to do anything about that situation.
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:07.160]  Well, I just grimaced involuntarily when you were telling that story. I remember covering
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:11.280]  at the time. And I'm not just saying this because I've been in situations people have
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:15.640]  knives and stuff and I went after them. But it's actually a fear thing. I like attack
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:21.240]  instead of run. It's just it's what I do. And that feels a lot better. I can't do the
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:26.200]  other thing. It's actually a problem I have. And I was imagining if I was that guy, I know
[03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:27.200]  it.
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:30.640]  And I because I know about guns. If I've seen the guy turn his back or he's around the corner,
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.440]  I would have gone and hidden there. I would grab a desk and, you know, ran towards him.
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:39.960]  And that happens a lot of times now where people do tackle shooters. And I just can't
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:43.680]  imagine people getting in fetal positions to be killed. I mean, if you're going to kill
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:46.840]  me anyways, I'm going to fight you. Right. I mean, what would you have done if you were
[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:47.840]  there?
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:50.160]  I mean, I know you're not trying to say you're macho. God, you're a paratrooper and stuff.
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:54.920]  I mean, I think most Texans I know, even when you see if somebody pulls a gun out, people
[03:14:54.920 --> 03:14:58.800]  try to stomp them. Right. Susanna Hupp's dad tried to go stop the guy and rush him and
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:02.200]  got shot exactly at the lupus. Why not have them have guns?
[03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:06.480]  Exactly. We need to empower the people. The people need to be empowered. The people in
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:10.200]  Chicago need to be empowered. They don't need law enforcement because law enforcement's
[03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:11.200]  not doing it.
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:14.400]  The more they hire, it doesn't do anything. Exactly. Empower the people and return that
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:17.120]  power back to the people so the people can protect themselves.
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:23.280]  I mean, look at Chicago, where only the government has guns and the criminals. It's it's it's
[03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:28.780]  it's hellish. And it's one mile from the president's residence. One mile. That's where the majority
[03:15:28.780 --> 03:15:32.080]  of that crime takes place. What is it? Five hundred and thirty something people a year
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:36.560]  shot there. Right. Killed, killed, killed, killed. And there's something like three thousand
[03:15:36.560 --> 03:15:40.760]  shot. I mean, that is. So what you have a situation of the criminals having the guns
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:44.960]  and your law abiding citizens are at home cowering down, hiding because they can't go
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:47.080]  and purchase that for that firearm to protect themselves.
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:51.120]  And I think of Chicago, I've been there a lot of family lives up there. It's a nice
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:55.360]  city. Right. I mean, it's a famous city. Why have they allowed this? And that is the last
[03:15:55.360 --> 03:15:58.280]  state that does not have a concealed handgun license program. I know they're working on
[03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:01.320]  something right now and hopefully they will come up with something.
[03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:04.440]  Take Dallas. I mean, I remember when they first put the concealed carry and it was two
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:10.400]  days after it had gone and people had been able to do the the the program in the first
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:14.480]  were issued a few months into it. There was a carjacking that were happening all the time.
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:17.920]  I grew up in Dallas. It was dangerous. Right. There was a carjacking on Central Expressway
[03:16:17.920 --> 03:16:21.600]  during stop and go traffic. And a guy was dragging me out of a car and a guy stepped
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:24.000]  out behind and shot the guy dead.
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:28.880]  And and then immediately the carjackings just stopped because now there were guns. Right.
[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:31.800]  We need to learn something from Texas. The rest of the country can actually take this
[03:16:31.800 --> 03:16:35.780]  message where, you know, we started our concealed handgun license program here in Texas back
[03:16:35.780 --> 03:16:37.680]  in nineteen ninety five.
[03:16:37.680 --> 03:16:42.320]  Our crime actually dropped dramatically here in the state of twenty five percent. Yes.
[03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:48.940]  And you have your stats for the year of 2011. You have over sixty three thousand people
[03:16:48.940 --> 03:16:54.040]  were convicted of crimes in the year 2011. Out of that sixty three thousand, only one
[03:16:54.040 --> 03:16:56.880]  hundred and twenty were CHL holders. You know, so the program that we have here actually
[03:16:56.880 --> 03:16:57.880]  works for us.
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:01.600]  Our CHL holders are law abiding citizens. They're not the people that are going to.
[03:17:01.600 --> 03:17:04.880]  Well, let's just say it statistically, they're even better than the police because you've
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:08.960]  got psychos and criminals, not all of them. Twenty percent or so they estimate in criminology.
[03:17:08.960 --> 03:17:12.720]  That's a fact. We want to become cops. They want to do it so they can get away with crime,
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:13.920]  be a better criminal.
[03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:17.760]  You don't have that with CHL because the criminals is carrying on anyways. They like committing
[03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:21.360]  the crime. Right. Why? Why go all through that trouble of getting a license, doing the
[03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:24.640]  background check, paying all the fees just to commit a crime when you can just go and
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:25.960]  grab the gun and commit the crime.
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:30.260]  So the CHL are the best people. Yes. And they've they've they've been looking for problems
[03:17:30.260 --> 03:17:33.760]  and they just can't find. And because CHL holders have been vetted and these people
[03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:37.680]  want to do the right thing and protect themselves and their family.
[03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:44.680]  Well, it just shows they're people of common sense, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. What
[03:17:44.680 --> 03:17:48.960]  is for people that don't know in Texas, but also in other areas, what is the current law
[03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:51.160]  on carrying loaded firearms in your vehicle?
[03:17:51.160 --> 03:17:55.160]  Well, in the state of Texas, you can have a loaded handgun in your vehicle without a
[03:17:55.160 --> 03:18:00.280]  license. It must be concealed in the vehicle. Now, prior to 2007, you had to be traveling
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:07.380]  from one county to another. Well, after that, 2007, everyone became you everyone's traveling.
[03:18:07.380 --> 03:18:10.680]  So it became legal to have a loaded handgun in your vehicle. It must be concealed in the
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:15.000]  vehicle as long as you're not committing a crime, anything greater than a Class C misdemeanor.
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:21.160]  That's an ordinance regulating traffic or the gun is not openly it's not open. The problem
[03:18:21.160 --> 03:18:24.920]  is you got to get out of your car. Correct. Once you get out of that vehicle, unless you're
[03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:30.040]  traveling to and from your home, then you must have a CHL.
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:33.520]  I tell you, it's even pointless to even have laws on this. The criminals aren't going to
[03:18:33.520 --> 03:18:38.680]  follow anything anyways. It's just pointless. Well, me personally, I've never had time to
[03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:42.920]  go to the concealed carry, but I think I'm going to take it from you. And, you know,
[03:18:42.920 --> 03:18:46.960]  my wife obviously knows the law. She's a good shot, able to do it. She hasn't had time to
[03:18:46.960 --> 03:18:51.260]  go do it. We've got to go do it. Myself, of all people back before that law, I just carried
[03:18:51.260 --> 03:18:54.960]  a rifle in my car. But then with children, when you put them in the car and put it in
[03:18:54.960 --> 03:18:58.560]  the trunk or if I was getting death threats, you know, then I'd put the shotgun up the
[03:18:58.560 --> 03:18:59.560]  front with me.
[03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:02.980]  But that was only a few times when I had people actually after me. I want to get into those
[03:19:02.980 --> 03:19:07.300]  whole stories here on air. But the point is, I go to like places don't even have security.
[03:19:07.300 --> 03:19:11.400]  I kind of don't worry about it. But it's almost like I have a responsibility to go get a concealed
[03:19:11.400 --> 03:19:16.480]  carry just to be there in case I see a crime being committed. It's almost like a dereliction
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:18.600]  of a citizen's duty to not be armed.
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:22.400]  Right. You need to be armed. You need to know what the laws are, know what you can, what
[03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:26.440]  you can, you cannot do to keep yourself and your family out of trouble and to keep them
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:27.440]  safe.
[03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:30.480]  I want to come back and take phone calls all over the place. We'll do a whole hour over
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:36.840]  drive with our guests. We're gonna go to Mouse Link, Melinda, Frank and Aaron and Theresa.
[03:19:36.840 --> 03:19:39.720]  And I'll get to all of you. I apologize you've been holding so long. But hey, you got to
[03:19:39.720 --> 03:19:44.040]  hear Viggo Mortensen. Hey, do you ever think you'd be following Viggo Mortensen on the
[03:19:44.040 --> 03:19:45.040]  radio?
[03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.960]  Oh, no, no, sir. That's pretty amazing. That is really.
[03:19:47.960 --> 03:19:51.960]  And he's what you call kind of a real liberal. But the point is, we're we're getting him
[03:19:51.960 --> 03:19:55.280]  to think about what we're saying. And then we're thinking about what he's saying, getting
[03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:59.480]  outside those boxes and having true diversity. We'll be right back with our guest. I'm Alex
[03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:00.480]  Jones.
[03:20:00.480 --> 03:20:09.160]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we
[03:20:09.160 --> 03:20:15.800]  are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front. Infowars.com is leading the
[03:20:15.800 --> 03:20:22.080]  fight against the technocrats. But we can't do that without your help by getting the films,
[03:20:22.080 --> 03:20:28.400]  bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com. You will wake up people in your area and support
[03:20:28.400 --> 03:20:34.280]  our operation as we move to the next level. We need your help to spread the word like
[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:39.600]  never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces
[03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:46.520]  of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program
[03:20:46.520 --> 03:20:53.680]  of global eugenics, dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info
[03:20:53.680 --> 03:21:02.960]  war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. What's safer and cheaper than prescription
[03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:09.520]  drugs? Glad you asked. The answer is renovation teas. Herbal remedies are much safer and much
[03:21:09.520 --> 03:21:14.840]  cheaper than prescription drugs taste great. And most importantly, herbal teas are effective
[03:21:14.840 --> 03:21:20.680]  and non addictive. Renovation tea is especially unique. And here's why we spent years researching
[03:21:20.680 --> 03:21:27.600]  herbs and their beneficial properties. Renovation teas uses only 100% organic fair trade herbs.
[03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:32.360]  Our teas are blended towards specific ailments and health conditions such as diabetes, blood

[03:22:01.320 --> 03:22:04.480]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:09.720]  affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:14.160]  of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right
[03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:19.160]  to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:24.440]  Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin
[03:22:24.440 --> 03:22:29.840]  D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:34.340]  intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries
[03:22:34.340 --> 03:22:38.320]  of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading with

[03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:36.000]  I really appreciate the callers holding so long, Melinda and Mouselink. Everybody, I'm
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:39.040]  going to you right now. Then we're going to get more into the Second Amendment, take Second
[03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:44.720]  Amendment calls in the balance of the hour with the proprietor of centraltexasgunworks.com.
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:49.280]  He owns a gun shop, a gun range, a gunsmith shop. It's very popular. Everybody I know
[03:24:49.280 --> 03:24:53.640]  tends to use it here in South Austin. And then he's out there politically fighting for
[03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:58.240]  your freedom. That's what we need to see from gun shop owners. Not, oh, I'm not political.
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:01.280]  The ATF will come harass me. I'm going to talk to you about that coming up. But right
[03:25:01.280 --> 03:25:06.440]  now let's talk to Mouselink who's been a real trooper holding. Mouselink, you had a question.
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:07.440]  Go ahead.
[03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:12.720]  Well, given the current conversation you guys are having about guns in the Second Amendment,
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:17.480]  I thought we could segue from the Futurism stuff that we were talking about earlier into
[03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:22.880]  3D printing. I think I was the first guy to bring up this issue on your program talking
[03:25:22.880 --> 03:25:28.360]  to Mike Adams some months ago. And I just wondered if your guests had anything to say
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:29.360]  on that subject.
[03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:35.600]  Oh, yes, absolutely. I know Cody Wilson really well. I've actually gone to eat lunch and
[03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:40.480]  dinner with Cody quite a few times. And we sit back and we talk about the 3D printing
[03:25:40.480 --> 03:25:47.400]  and how it's not just about the 3D printer gun. It's about the access to that machine
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:52.800]  and for the people being able to do whatever they want in their home because that is your
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:56.800]  home and that is your property. The federal government, the government needs to keep up
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:25:57.800]  with technology.
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:02.520]  Well, they're using the international lines, but he's in Texas. He should be able to do
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:08.680]  whatever he wants with a Liberator gun, a 380 that they dropped over France to resist.
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:12.720]  I mean, what, people can't have in their own home and build a 380 single shot?
[03:26:12.720 --> 03:26:16.920]  Yeah, so if you want to sit at home and build whatever, if you want to build something to-
[03:26:16.920 --> 03:26:19.400]  But anybody could build a gun that knows basic metallurgy.
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:23.840]  Yeah, and their concern is about it getting through the metal detectors. Well, you know
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:30.240]  what? I guess they need to step up their efforts on technology to keep up with just like you
[03:26:30.240 --> 03:26:33.640]  have your Facebook, you have your online things. The government's got to keep up with what's
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:36.920]  going on and so they're going to have to keep up with the 3D printing as well.
[03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:40.720]  Well, the answer is if somebody sneaks one through, the pilots are armed. You're going
[03:26:40.720 --> 03:26:43.400]  to trust them to fly this plane but not have a gun?
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:46.960]  Right, right. Well, there's no way you can legislate crazy.
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:51.680]  Absolutely. Mouse Link, thank you for calling. Good to hear from you. Melinda in Florida,
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:54.040]  thank you for holding. You're a trooper. Welcome.
[03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:58.240]  Oh, thank you so much, Alex, for taking my call. I had called on a different subject
[03:26:58.240 --> 03:26:59.800]  but I'm going to talk about what you're talking now.
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:02.960]  No, no, bring up your immigration thing. You're polite. You can get into the gun thing after.
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:03.960]  Bring up the immigration.
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:09.400]  Well, I had called about an hour or so ago about the immigration thing in terms of the
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:14.520]  illegal immigrants that come into Southern California. I'm originally from Southern California,
[03:27:14.520 --> 03:27:19.960]  born and raised. The neighborhoods that I was raised in were American, mostly ethically
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:26.240]  black, that's what I am. Over the course of 20, 30 years, those neighborhoods are now
[03:27:26.240 --> 03:27:27.240]  gone.
[03:27:27.240 --> 03:27:32.920]  We've been chased out and now we are getting racist attacks by certain Latino Americans
[03:27:32.920 --> 03:27:36.400]  who do not like African Americans and they're killing us.
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:43.160]  Well, that actually came out even in mainstream news that you're having like 15, 20, 30 to
[03:27:43.160 --> 03:27:49.360]  10, the Hispanic gangs killing blackbirds or mayatas is the term. And again, all Hispanics
[03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:54.400]  I know aren't like that, but it is an issue that, I mean, Latin America, things are based
[03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:57.360]  on gangs killing each other, Latin killing Latin.
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:01.760]  And if America doesn't have a gang culture on liberty and freedom and justice, it's like
[03:28:01.760 --> 03:28:07.000]  we don't have an immune system politically. And then groups come in that are gang oriented
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:12.940]  and it's politically incorrect to say anything about it. That is a big issue. And then government
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:17.520]  also coming in and putting everybody on welfare has destroyed congruent communities.
[03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:20.560]  I mean, what was it like to see this happen in Southern California?
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:26.980]  It's a huge issue, Alex. I've been speaking, talking to people in my area to the point
[03:28:26.980 --> 03:28:32.280]  where I went to college, graduated, trained actually to be a teacher. I decided not to
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:36.000]  be a teacher because I saw what was gonna be the blueprint on the wall and I had my
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:37.920]  own children to take care of.
[03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:43.960]  I'm a homeschool mom. I've been homeschooling for well over 20 years. And I have educated
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:48.220]  and talked to other moms. I don't care what race they are, Hispanic, whoever they are,
[03:28:48.220 --> 03:28:53.540]  to get their children out of the indoctrinated schools here that want to dumb them down and
[03:28:53.540 --> 03:29:00.000]  don't want to teach them anything in pertains to how to just live and be human. In pertains
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:04.280]  to which our guest is talking about, my sons have been raised because they're homeschooled
[03:29:04.280 --> 03:29:08.800]  to protect humanity. My sons are out for the good.
[03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:13.160]  They are out for the good guy. If someone is being assaulted, somebody is being herded
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:17.560]  and they're bad, they're the bad guy. It's not about race. It's not about color. It's
[03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:21.520]  not about anything. If you are a human being, then that's what we're about.
[03:29:21.520 --> 03:29:26.080]  The system does use it from every angle and it's a nightmare situation. What was your
[03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:28.240]  comment on guns?
[03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:34.520]  My comment on guns is that as a female, who is a very small size female, can't afford
[03:29:34.520 --> 03:29:36.320]  to be toughing with men and other people.
[03:29:36.320 --> 03:29:40.280]  Stay there. I want to come back to you and then get your take on this because it's the
[03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:45.480]  equalizer. I mean, I've got two daughters and the women in my family are pretty tough
[03:29:45.480 --> 03:29:48.880]  so they're going to be tough. It doesn't matter. They need to be able to have a gun to protect
[03:29:48.880 --> 03:29:50.200]  themselves from criminals.
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:30:01.560]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:33:01.120 --> 03:33:04.880]  You've heard it here, I'm on television so everybody knows it. I believe in the Second
[03:33:04.880 --> 03:33:08.480]  Amendment. I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[03:33:08.480 --> 03:33:15.080]  We're going to find the people who are doing this, take them out and shoot them. No, you
[03:33:15.080 --> 03:33:20.120]  take them out, they are traitors of this country and shoot them. Shoot them dead. I'll pay
[03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:24.920]  for the bullet. Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic
[03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:27.040]  that you got legally and pop them.
[03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:34.040]  I'd love to see that. In uniform.
[03:33:34.040 --> 03:33:43.040]  I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I won't take your
[03:33:43.040 --> 03:33:44.040]  handgun away.
[03:33:44.040 --> 03:34:03.240]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:10.040]  Michael Cargill, entrepreneur, Army veteran, patriot. You can go to centraltexasgunworks.com
[03:34:10.040 --> 03:34:13.040]  and find out about what he's doing. It's a great website, a lot of pro-Second Amendment
[03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:17.640]  info there. And if you're in Central Texas, he's not a sponsor, but I'm plugging it. Go
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:22.200]  in there. We're going to go back to this lady, Melinda, to finish her story and get your
[03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:23.520]  take on that in a moment.
[03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:30.080]  But you were telling me during the break, your real passion is getting women armed and
[03:34:30.080 --> 03:34:34.660]  trained so they can protect themselves and equalize. And that is an incredible thing.
[03:34:34.660 --> 03:34:40.240]  Think about the civil rights, the human rights, the God-given right of self-defense and empowering
[03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:48.000]  women who for thousands of years have been dominated by bad men. Now you're empowering
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:51.680]  them. I would think Gloria Steinem and all these so-called liberals would be screaming
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:53.240]  from the rooftops to arm women.
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:57.920]  Yeah, I applaud Melinda because it's about empowering women to protect themselves and
[03:34:57.920 --> 03:35:04.280]  making it that equalizer. When you're walking from that building, going to your vehicle,
[03:35:04.280 --> 03:35:09.540]  whatever it is, you have tools within your means to protect yourself because you cannot
[03:35:09.540 --> 03:35:14.800]  have that law enforcement officer there to help you at all.
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:16.640]  And it's just common sense, isn't it?
[03:35:16.640 --> 03:35:21.760]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And I'll tell you, I love having the women come to our class at Central
[03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:27.400]  Texas Gun Works because the women, they actually, they listen and they want to do the right
[03:35:27.400 --> 03:35:31.560]  thing and they actually come out shooting a lot better than the men.
[03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:36.440]  What do you think is going to end up happening long term? Because you seem like a pretty
[03:35:36.440 --> 03:35:41.420]  smart guy who's got his ear to the ground. What's your gut on whether they'll be successful
[03:35:41.420 --> 03:35:45.320]  or not? Because when they wanted to get our guns, they were demonizing the Second Amendment.
[03:35:45.320 --> 03:35:48.820]  Now that they've lost for now, they're like, we never wanted your guns, so we all go back
[03:35:48.820 --> 03:35:49.820]  to sleep.
[03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:52.800]  But I don't see that happening, but I don't see them stopping. So it's like two freight
[03:35:52.800 --> 03:35:56.800]  trains speeding down the track towards each other. What do you think is gonna happen?
[03:35:56.800 --> 03:36:02.200]  I think after the midterm elections, they're gonna actually come back again a second time,
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:06.560]  a second wind because this president, the current administration is not gonna let this
[03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:07.560]  go.
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:12.360]  They took a big hit and he made a promise to the Democratic Party that he was gonna
[03:36:12.360 --> 03:36:17.360]  do something about guns. And so he's gonna come after them. He's definitely gonna come
[03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:18.920]  after them.
[03:36:18.920 --> 03:36:21.520]  Why do you think they want our guns?
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:26.240]  It's about control. It's about control and controlling individuals. It really needs to
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:32.560]  be about safety and they've lost that target, that eye on the picture there.
[03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:37.880]  Plug centraltexasgunworks.com. Let's say you're a woman out there or a man or somebody who
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:44.320]  hasn't been around guns. You believe all the stuff from Hollywood and mystifying it. How
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:48.120]  do you demystify it? How does somebody come in and take a basic gun safety class from
[03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:49.120]  you?
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:54.640]  Well, we actually focus on training. We don't focus on mainly selling the guns themselves.
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:36:58.400]  I want a person to come in, they wanna learn safety. They wanna learn how to keep their
[03:36:58.400 --> 03:37:04.360]  family safe. They wanna learn that we have a penal code 46.13 that says that if you allow
[03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:08.100]  your child to get access to a firearm in the state of Texas, they're gonna come after you
[03:37:08.100 --> 03:37:10.280]  and charge you with a crime.
[03:37:10.280 --> 03:37:14.520]  So we focus on that training and teaching them about the laws, making sure they're safe,
[03:37:14.520 --> 03:37:19.440]  make sure their kid's safe because you don't want your son actually going and sitting with
[03:37:19.440 --> 03:37:23.480]  your neighbor's son. We don't want dumb and dumber getting together learning gun safety.
[03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:27.880]  I want them learning that in our beginning handgun course or our concealed handgun course
[03:37:27.880 --> 03:37:29.360]  or our advanced pistol course.
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:33.000]  And then once you get that concealed handgun license and you're ready to carry to protect
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:36.320]  yourself and your family, it's about how are you gonna deploy that firearm? How are you
[03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:40.200]  gonna get out of your concealed carry position? Whether you're a lady and you're carrying
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:44.920]  inside your purse, how are you gonna get that gun out to protect yourself if needs be?
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:48.840]  Because you may only have four seconds to draw that firearm. And so those are some of
[03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:52.200]  the things that we go over and we teach you.
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:55.720]  You can always tell when women are carrying one because they'll put their purse around
[03:37:55.720 --> 03:37:56.880]  kind of on the front.
[03:37:56.880 --> 03:38:01.880]  Yeah, and they walk with confidence. You don't wanna mess with that person. And I give them
[03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:05.260]  some pepper spray. I make sure that every female that attends our course gets some free
[03:38:05.260 --> 03:38:10.280]  pepper spray. So I'll give them that cuz I say, if something happens, you have some pepper
[03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:13.080]  spray, you get a stun gun or something like that and something happens, you give them
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:16.040]  a good shot in the face of that pepper spray, that gives you a couple seconds to get to
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:17.040]  your gun.
[03:38:17.040 --> 03:38:20.120]  That gives you a couple seconds to run away and protect yourself.
[03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:23.880]  Well, it's that threat continuum where you don't wanna just cuz somebody runs up and
[03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:27.560]  says something, you shoot them. No, it's like once they start coming at you, then it's the
[03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:29.440]  pepper spray. And if they keep coming, that's-
[03:38:29.440 --> 03:38:32.560]  Right, getting a good shot of pepper spray in the face. Like I said, it gives you a couple
[03:38:32.560 --> 03:38:35.080]  seconds to run away or gives you a couple seconds to get to your gun.
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:39.760]  Well, what's amazed me is I've heard you on local radio, seen you on TV. Some of our reporters
[03:38:39.760 --> 03:38:44.020]  out the gun rallies have interviewed you, Jocari and others. But I just keep hearing
[03:38:44.020 --> 03:38:46.520]  people talk about Central Texas Gun Works.
[03:38:46.520 --> 03:38:50.200]  It's like Weldon goes, yeah, you don't think you're really cleaning these guns, good boss.
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:53.280]  Let me take them to a great gunsmith I know, and then I didn't even realize that was you
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:59.840]  till you told me. And then I heard other people talking about Central Texas Gun Works. You
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:01.200]  guys must be pretty busy.
[03:39:01.200 --> 03:39:08.000]  Yes, we stay pretty busy cuz we focus on training and customer service. People are tired of
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:09.960]  walking to that gun store and-
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:11.760]  They act arrogant like you don't know anything.
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:15.880]  Correct, and feeling uncomfortable. We actually have females that work for us.
[03:39:15.880 --> 03:39:19.360]  What is it about service places that are selling things that don't know how to give people
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:22.000]  hospitality? I don't know what that is.
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:27.180]  Yeah, and so we wanna give them that good customer service. I have a wide range of people
[03:39:27.180 --> 03:39:34.360]  that work for me. Like I said, I have military veterans, I have females. We're a nice, good
[03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:38.200]  and close knit family, and we believe in taking care of people and actually teaching them
[03:39:38.200 --> 03:39:40.240]  safety and the laws.
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:46.280]  Well, well said, very exciting. Let's go back to Melinda in Florida. Again, we commend you
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:50.480]  for having firearms, protecting yourself, that's awesome. Did you have anything else
[03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:51.720]  you wanted to add on that subject?
[03:39:51.720 --> 03:39:56.440]  Well, absolutely, I just wanna commend what your guest has said. And I would love to train
[03:39:56.440 --> 03:40:00.600]  under him just to know what to do the right thing to protect my family, not only my family,
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:06.400]  but my neighbors. I believe that as a female, being with our small stature and our small
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:10.020]  size and the fact that we have groceries and kids and babies, we really don't have a lot
[03:40:10.020 --> 03:40:13.080]  of time to be fighting other men and other bad guys.
[03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:18.540]  And we need to be able to have the drop or any sort of advantage that we have to be able
[03:40:18.540 --> 03:40:23.360]  to get the bad guys off of us, no matter who they may be, private citizen or government
[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:30.840]  carry. So I also train my daughters to, you gotta do what you gotta do. The females, no
[03:40:30.840 --> 03:40:36.080]  matter what, tend to get raped. And to have that happen to even one of my daughters would
[03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:41.080]  kill me. Certainly, Alex, with your daughters, you would feel the same that I feel, that
[03:40:41.080 --> 03:40:43.400]  it would absolutely rip my heart out.
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:49.160]  I can't take it. So I tell my daughters, you gotta do what you gotta do to protect yourself.
[03:40:49.160 --> 03:40:53.560]  Absolutely, well, it's key to go out and take a gun safety course, and then get demystified
[03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:58.040]  and then store it properly, and that's just the way to go. I appreciate you calling in.
[03:40:58.040 --> 03:41:03.000]  My issue is this, I'm so busy that I grew up around guns, grew up around basic safety.
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:09.840]  Four years old, you put some, and there's different ways to do it, but you go out to
[03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:14.280]  grandpa's house, out at the farm, and they shoot a watermelon and say, now you see this
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:17.640]  gun in the toy, you see what it just did.
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:21.920]  And then they take you out in bird season and shoot some birds, quail dove, and say,
[03:41:21.920 --> 03:41:25.520]  you see what that did to a bird, is when you're four years old. And then they set you down
[03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:28.660]  with a Folgers coffee can, I can't tell you how many people have been trained the same
[03:41:28.660 --> 03:41:34.760]  way, with a.410, and you shoot it. And then you're taught, now you don't touch this unless
[03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:38.440]  you're told you can touch it, and then you're taught the basic safety, and you're taken
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:43.060]  out five, six, seven times a year, cuz I lived in the city, I always loved to go shooting.
[03:41:43.060 --> 03:41:48.280]  And by the time you're 11 or 12 years old, I was shooting bullseye freehand with a 243
[03:41:48.280 --> 03:41:54.500]  at 300 yards. And that's an example of just basic marksman training that made Americans
[03:41:54.500 --> 03:41:59.480]  in warfare feared all over the world, and it's good to see that culture coming back.
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:03.840]  But I'll be honest with you, I keep my guns locked up in a gun safe, and I've got some
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:08.960]  instant access pistol safes, and my nine year old, ten year old are good shots now. And
[03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:12.880]  they know you just don't touch guns, and even the BB guns are in the garage in a locked
[03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:15.380]  up area, they get permission to get those out.
[03:42:15.380 --> 03:42:17.600]  And they're not allowed to really use them where other kids come over, because I don't
[03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:22.560]  know how they're gonna act around them. And that's my basic safety, but I should probably
[03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:28.120]  even do a better job of that, and explain to me the penal code on children and guns.
[03:42:28.120 --> 03:42:32.600]  Yeah, you have Penal Code Section 46.13. That's in Texas, but it varies.
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:36.880]  Right, it does vary from state to state. But the way it works is, if your child gets access
[03:42:36.880 --> 03:42:40.640]  to a firearm, no one's injured, is not discharged, you're gonna get off easy, you'll get charged
[03:42:40.640 --> 03:42:46.080]  with a Class C misdemeanor. But if your child gets access to a firearm, is discharged, someone's
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:49.480]  injured, you're gonna get charged with a Class A misdemeanor.
[03:42:49.480 --> 03:42:53.880]  If your child gets access to your firearm, and kills himself, shoots himself, or kills
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:58.960]  another one of your kids, the state of Texas will give you seven days to go and bury your
[03:42:58.960 --> 03:43:02.200]  child before they come and arrest you and charge you with a Class A. And what you just
[03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:07.000]  touched on right now is parenting. What a concept, raising your kids. I remember when
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:12.440]  I was a little kid, my mother would say to me, you better be in the house before the
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:13.440]  sun goes down.
[03:43:13.440 --> 03:43:18.920]  Don't let your shadow catch you, and she's not talking about the street lights. It's
[03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:25.960]  about parenting. Right now, you have babies raising babies, and that's gonna be part of
[03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:31.840]  the problem. If people focus on parenting and raising their children, then we're gonna
[03:43:31.840 --> 03:43:34.900]  have some of these other issues that take place.
[03:43:34.900 --> 03:43:38.200]  And now the state's coming and saying, don't worry about parenting, we'll do it, they do
[03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:43.960]  an even worse job. I'm really worried about society degenerating, and government wants
[03:43:43.960 --> 03:43:51.160]  us all to live like in New York or Chicago in these crime capitals. It's so sad. Also,
[03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:56.040]  they can dominate us and use the crime wave as an excuse to take over even more.
[03:43:56.040 --> 03:43:59.480]  Let's talk to Teresa in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:43:59.480 --> 03:44:07.360]  Hi, I just have a simple question for you. I saw on my news feed today on Facebook, and
[03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:12.200]  I looked at the article, but I had to get on the road really fast. It didn't seem to
[03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:17.280]  be a stew article or anything. They said that the government had ordered 30,000 guillotines.
[03:44:17.280 --> 03:44:21.640]  Is that true, and why would the government order 30,000 guillotines?
[03:44:21.640 --> 03:44:26.800]  Well, the United States has not really historically used the guillotine on execution. They've
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:31.960]  used hanging, the gas chamber, lethal injection, electric chair, things like that. This is
[03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:36.600]  a, and I'm glad you called in about this, this is a perennial thing I've heard for 18
[03:44:36.600 --> 03:44:38.160]  years on air.
[03:44:38.160 --> 03:44:42.520]  It's a rumor that got out that a truck dumped over, it's always in Kansas or Texas or New
[03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:49.200]  York. And it was martial law signs and guillotines. And it's this whole thing of the Antichrist
[03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:54.840]  is gonna use guillotines to chop Christian's heads off. And maybe that's gonna happen someday.
[03:44:54.840 --> 03:45:00.080]  My point is, is it's an urban legend, just like this National Stabilization Nacera Act.
[03:45:00.080 --> 03:45:04.560]  That's another made up thing. I mean, there are good people in government and there are
[03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:09.160]  white hats as they call them. But still that doesn't, it's just one of these urban legends.
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:13.920]  That is a true urban legend. And what they're buying is 2 billion hollow point rounds and
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:17.600]  other rounds and 7,000 armored vehicles and anti-mine vehicles.
[03:45:17.600 --> 03:45:21.200]  And they're trying to take on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, and they're trying
[03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:25.120]  as best they can to divide us along race, religion, everything else. So the government
[03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:30.100]  can play the part of the referee. And they're trying to get all sorts of just religious
[03:45:30.100 --> 03:45:35.840]  war, race war, social economic infighting, while these big mega banks drain the country
[03:45:35.840 --> 03:45:37.640]  offshore.
[03:45:37.640 --> 03:45:41.400]  So that's their goal. Does that answer your question, Theresa?
[03:45:41.400 --> 03:45:44.840]  Yeah, that answered my question. Thank you very much.
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:48.600]  Thank you, God bless. And don't feel bad that you called in about an urban legend, okay?
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:54.880]  And it doesn't mean I'm the final say on that. But that's something I can officially say.
[03:45:54.880 --> 03:45:59.480]  To be clear, I'm saying I'm not the final say on everything, okay? So don't just believe
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:04.120]  me. But on that, I can say that's definitive, this whole guillotine thing. And people are
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:09.120]  like, you're covering up the guillotines. Show me the proof. Frank in New York, you're
[03:46:09.120 --> 03:46:11.120]  on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:17.840]  Hi, Alex. There's actually an interesting C-SPAN video which aired on C-SPAN 1991. There
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:21.920]  was Jay Rockefeller at a roast of Pappy Kent. Actually, Newt Gingrich was actually in the
[03:46:21.920 --> 03:46:28.000]  audience in the crowd. And Jay Rockefeller was joking about the trial commission and
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:32.040]  Bill Deberg. And the video's on YouTube. He just typed Rockefeller roast into YouTube
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:33.040]  and it comes up. It's like a seven-minute video.
[03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:36.360]  I wanna play that. Rockefeller roast or is it Buchanan roast?
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:40.800]  Just a Rockefeller roast comes up. It's a six-minute, you'll find it. It's a seven-minute
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:45.360]  video. I'll play it a little bit right now here. It's pretty bizarre. It's very bizarre.
[03:46:45.360 --> 03:46:51.640]  It's the most bizarre. He confesses the new world order. He says, if you looked up the
[03:46:51.640 --> 03:46:56.240]  Bill Deberg in 91, you could hardly find anything back in the day. It was very difficult. Very
[03:46:56.240 --> 03:47:00.440]  few people on it. And so it was his mainstream. I'll play it like a little video right now,
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:01.440]  Leo.
[03:47:01.440 --> 03:47:09.800]  Kid playing with blocks. Pat Buchanan and I both had that experience together. Kids
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:15.600]  were like the ones you saw in the movie, a little round square blocks, colored ABC. Mine
[03:47:15.600 --> 03:47:19.600]  tended to be called 48th Street, 49th Street, Fifth Avenue.
[03:47:19.600 --> 03:47:23.040]  There's actually an interesting C-SPAN video which aired on...
[03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:30.880]  Well, they talked about Pat running for president. And if he did that, I would be very supportive.
[03:47:30.880 --> 03:47:31.880]  Hello?
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:37.720]  Yeah, it's very funny. And I heard you turned up your computer, so you were delayed 30 seconds.
[03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:41.040]  But yeah, we'll find that clip, play it on the nightly news tonight. Sounds very interesting.
[03:47:41.040 --> 03:47:42.040]  I was unaware of that.
[03:47:42.040 --> 03:47:47.440]  He also says, we own the politicians. The presidency has a bad reputation because the
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:52.440]  elite own the presidency and all the politicians. He actually said that in the roast of Pat
[03:47:52.440 --> 03:47:57.200]  Buchanan in 1991. This is so bizarre. He said, if you come to the president, why don't you
[03:47:57.200 --> 03:48:00.920]  join us? We will order and have total power, he says. It's very strange.
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:04.560]  Well, we're gonna play that tonight. That's big. So much stuff's being dug up now and
[03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:09.240]  put on the web. How do you think the establishment, Michael, is gonna get away with all this corruption
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:11.560]  as more and more stuff comes out?
[03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:17.440]  Hopefully the people will stay educated and actually hold their feet to the fire and say,
[03:48:17.440 --> 03:48:21.160]  hey, we're not gonna take this anymore. We want, like I said, the federal government
[03:48:21.160 --> 03:48:25.520]  to be transparent. The federal government is not designed to always take care of all
[03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:31.480]  our problems. We don't always need the federal government. We don't need Big Brother to always
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:34.840]  take care of us. We can take care of ourselves.
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:38.760]  We're gonna go to more calls. Sounds like an American idea, how extreme. We're gonna
[03:48:38.760 --> 03:48:43.620]  go to more calls here before the show ends in about 15 minutes or 14 minutes or so. But
[03:48:43.620 --> 03:48:47.660]  I wanted to ask you, because I always intend to do this and I don't do it. But you're actually
[03:48:47.660 --> 03:48:52.160]  on my way to work in things. You're actually in South Austin, closer to where I live. I
[03:48:52.160 --> 03:48:57.840]  live south of Austin. How fast could I come do the concealed carry class?
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:49:02.440]  Cuz I've sent off to the DPS before, got in my packet like twice in the last decade, but
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.440]  never went and did it. And I've had other people that are friends of mine that are concealed
[03:49:06.440 --> 03:49:10.320]  carry saying, I'll give you a private class. I'll accelerate it all, whatever. But I almost
[03:49:10.320 --> 03:49:14.680]  don't even want that. I wanna go get the course, cuz it's always good to learn.
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:19.000]  If you wait until September, the law is gonna change where it's only gonna be four hours
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:22.440]  instead of the ten hours like it is now. So if you wait until then, you'll be able to
[03:49:22.440 --> 03:49:26.840]  take a four-hour course, do your shooting portion. And then right now, you can do it
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:31.780]  online. You go online to the GPS website, fill out the application, and pay the fee,
[03:49:31.780 --> 03:49:33.620]  and then we'll turn in your paperwork for you.
[03:49:33.620 --> 03:49:36.760]  Who has the best concealed carry law in the country?
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:40.920]  I think, well, I like Vermont. I actually like Vermont. You know why?
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:42.060]  That's what I thought was the best.
[03:49:42.060 --> 03:49:45.200]  Cuz in the state of Vermont, everyone can carry openly or concealed without a license.
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:48.300]  It's constitutional carry. So Vermont is gonna be the best state.
[03:49:48.300 --> 03:49:53.440]  And again, I'm not liking the fact that it's a law you go do this for concealed carry,
[03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:58.000]  because it kinda turns the right into a privilege. But I also do kinda like that this much training's
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:03.640]  going in, cuz my dad's done it. I've read the course online. It's really good. I mean,
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:07.600]  I think it instills gun culture in people and common law in people.
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:12.040]  Well, put your trust in people, because if you offer them a class, then they will actually
[03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:15.760]  come and take a class, rather than saying the government says it's mandatory to something
[03:50:15.760 --> 03:50:16.760]  that you have to do.
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:21.940]  No, I agree with that. I mean, I disagree with making you do it, but then at least it's
[03:50:21.940 --> 03:50:25.880]  good to make the government do something good. I mean, it's not perfect, but at least something
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:26.880]  good's happening out there.
[03:50:26.880 --> 03:50:31.160]  Right, right. And people are actually learning the laws. They actually are willing to take
[03:50:31.160 --> 03:50:33.800]  more classes to learn safety.
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:37.320]  I've also been told that the police treat concealed carry people with more respect.
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:41.120]  Oh, yeah, yeah. You pull your driver's license and your concealed handgun license out and
[03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:44.400]  show it to the officer, and the officer knows that you've gone through a thorough background
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:45.400]  check.
[03:50:45.400 --> 03:50:50.200]  Absolutely. I just wish the police on average were as good. I know a lot of them really
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:54.080]  are good, but I wish they were as good as concealed carry people on average, cuz there's
[03:50:54.080 --> 03:50:57.840]  definitely bad ones hiding in there. Just ask Serpico, who we're getting on soon. More
[03:50:57.840 --> 03:50:59.840]  calls coming up.
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:07.900]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:51:07.900 --> 03:51:12.960]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:19.920]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:20.920]  your help.
[03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:26.160]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:51:26.160 --> 03:51:32.720]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[03:51:32.720 --> 03:51:38.320]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[03:51:38.320 --> 03:51:45.560]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[03:51:45.560 --> 03:51:53.240]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[03:51:53.240 --> 03:52:00.560]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:52:00.560 --> 03:52:06.480]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[03:52:06.480 --> 03:52:11.160]  severe hot flashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard to work
[03:52:11.160 --> 03:52:16.680]  because it continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted and depleted
[03:52:16.680 --> 03:52:21.320]  after only three weeks on one world weight. I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally
[03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:26.880]  again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product. It is a little known fact
[03:52:26.880 --> 03:52:32.380]  that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione,
[03:52:32.380 --> 03:52:37.480]  but due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal
[03:52:37.480 --> 03:52:41.600]  cell function for your entire body? If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in
[03:52:41.600 --> 03:52:46.200]  your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work
[03:52:46.200 --> 03:52:51.040]  better. Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have. To order one world way, call

[03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:26.480]  Final segment with Michael Cargill. In rebroadcast, you're going to be able to hear Viggo Mortensen,
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:31.280]  listener of the show, on the show, amazing interview on a bunch of subjects. I want to
[03:54:31.280 --> 03:54:36.600]  jam in a few final calls here. But I think I asked a question before we went to break,
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:39.920]  and we were going to come back and talk about it, and now I don't remember. Michael, let
[03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:44.040]  me ask you this briefly. What is the best thing, ever since I was a kid, my dad would
[03:54:44.040 --> 03:54:50.680]  say the old pump shotgun, just because, for whatever reason, by semi-auto, with like bird
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:56.840]  shot in it, it was his idea that that was something that wouldn't kill neighbors necessarily
[03:54:56.840 --> 03:55:02.040]  as easily if he shot at somebody and it went out the wall, or it wouldn't kill somebody
[03:55:02.040 --> 03:55:05.440]  on the other side of the wall. And then he would also have a handgun with those what
[03:55:05.440 --> 03:55:08.200]  sheer safety slugs the air marshals would use.
[03:55:08.200 --> 03:55:12.400]  I think it's important, people, to also know, when you're doing stuff in your house and
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:16.560]  you've got a gun for self-defense, what is that issue? If there's a burglar with a gun
[03:55:16.560 --> 03:55:19.160]  and your kids' bedrooms are down there, what do you do?
[03:55:19.160 --> 03:55:24.080]  Anything that you're proficient in would be good to have for home protection. But I tell
[03:55:24.080 --> 03:55:27.560]  people to have a plan, just like taking a trip on an airplane. You take a trip on an
[03:55:27.560 --> 03:55:30.400]  airplane, they go over the security plan. In an event there's an emergency, we lose
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:33.560]  cabin pressure, this is going to drop down from the ceiling. Put it in your mouth, assist
[03:55:33.560 --> 03:55:36.400]  the person sitting next to you. In an event there's a water line in your seat because
[03:55:36.400 --> 03:55:38.080]  you may use the flotation device.
[03:55:38.080 --> 03:55:39.760]  But you don't want to use a.50 cal in your house.
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:44.240]  No, you do not. But you want to have a plan. And in my house, we actually have a safe room,
[03:55:44.240 --> 03:55:48.400]  a room that I want everyone to make it inside if something was to happen inside my home.
[03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:52.760]  If the alarm goes off, something that alerts us that someone's inside the home, I want
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:55.480]  everyone to make it into the safe room because I don't want to accidentally shoot one of
[03:55:55.480 --> 03:55:56.480]  my loved ones.
[03:55:56.480 --> 03:56:00.000]  So whatever that you're proficient with, that is what you use.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:03.880]  That's totally smart. And people say we're living in fear. No, we're living in power.
[03:56:03.880 --> 03:56:07.560]  We're living informed. We're not here just going to roll over.
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:13.080]  Right, you don't want to be like those people in a certain part of town where someone knocked
[03:56:13.080 --> 03:56:17.960]  on the door at 7.30, 7.45 in the evening and then someone opened the door and two guys
[03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:22.000]  went inside and robbed them with tasers and stun guns. You don't want to be like that
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:23.000]  person.
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:27.200]  You don't want to be like the person that worked at home at 12 noon in the afternoon
[03:56:27.200 --> 03:56:31.280]  on the second floor of his house. He has his bedroom, he has his office. At 12 noon, he
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:35.520]  stepped out of his, in the hallway out of his office and looked to his left and a guy
[03:56:35.520 --> 03:56:40.160]  stepped out of his bedroom. You don't want to be like that person. And then he looked
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:41.640]  at the guy and said, what are you doing in my house?
[03:56:41.640 --> 03:56:47.160]  And the guy ran to get his gun, came back out on the stairwell there in the hallway,
[03:56:47.160 --> 03:56:50.960]  looked downstairs and a separate guy came out of his kitchen. You want to be that guy.
[03:56:50.960 --> 03:56:54.400]  You want to have a plan of what you're going to do to protect yourself.
[03:56:54.400 --> 03:56:59.240]  I would have to be starving to death to break in somebody's house. I just do not, then I
[03:56:59.240 --> 03:57:02.840]  just come knock on the door and beg for the food. I do not get this breaking in people's
[03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:03.840]  houses.
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:07.600]  Those are the stories that we get in my class. People tell me some of the things that they've
[03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:10.600]  experienced. So we go over security plan. I give them a plan of what they're going to
[03:57:10.600 --> 03:57:14.120]  do. I want to make sure they protect them and their family. They have a safe room that
[03:57:14.120 --> 03:57:17.720]  way everyone in their family is accounted for.
[03:57:17.720 --> 03:57:23.040]  And I actually have cameras around my house. I'll help people set up security cameras for
[03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:27.400]  their home. And we have a little monitor where they can look at their cameras, see exactly
[03:57:27.400 --> 03:57:28.840]  where that intruder is.
[03:57:28.840 --> 03:57:34.040]  And cameras are so cheap now. This isn't Big Brother's cameras. These are ours. I got cameras
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:37.080]  as well. It's good to be out of town, be able to look and see what's going on.
[03:57:37.080 --> 03:57:40.520]  Oh, yes, I can look at my home. I can look at my shop. I can look at my parents' home.
[03:57:40.520 --> 03:57:43.980]  I can look at my sister's home because she's single right now. I can look at all their
[03:57:43.980 --> 03:57:48.520]  cameras and control their alarm systems from my cell phone. It's about me helping them
[03:57:48.520 --> 03:57:49.520]  say-
[03:57:49.520 --> 03:57:54.940]  You know what? I got a little, my gosh, I can't believe that the show has gone an hour
[03:57:54.940 --> 03:57:59.120]  in overdrive and I can't get to all these people. Real fast, Aaron in Nevada, you want
[03:57:59.120 --> 03:58:07.440]  to talk about car bombing evidence. Go ahead. All right, Aaron, go ahead, Aaron. All right,
[03:58:07.440 --> 03:58:12.480]  Aaron's gone and I can't go to Ronnie Ralph, Clark and Dean. I apologize. Again, I want
[03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:17.080]  to thank Michael Cargill for coming in, Viggo Mortensen, the crew, everybody doing a great
[03:58:17.080 --> 03:58:22.080]  job. Humanity needs to come together because humans like to be in gangs or clubs. Let's
[03:58:22.080 --> 03:58:27.000]  have a gang of liberty and freedom and justice and true equality and let's go to the stars
[03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:34.540]  together. That's the answer to 1984, to 1776 worldwide. My guest will be on the nightly
[03:58:34.540 --> 03:58:53.200]  news tonight, seven o'clock central.
