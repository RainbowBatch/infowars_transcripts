[00:00.000 --> 00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.680 --> 00:29.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:29.880 --> 00:37.360]  it's January 30th on this Wednesday edition 2013 we're gonna be live here
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.120]  for the next three hours and we had him on last week and the hour went by very
[00:42.120 --> 00:45.560]  quickly so I wanted to get him on for an hour today so you could question him
[00:45.560 --> 00:51.560]  Jim Garrow was talking about a quote a retired military living legend saying
[00:51.560 --> 00:56.080]  that the military brass that he knows has told them they're having a litmus test
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.880]  will you fire on US citizens well the military's training for that and that's
[00:59.880 --> 01:04.960]  in the news and General Boykin the former head of Special Forces he's been
[01:04.960 --> 01:10.280]  talking about plans for a police state he's been talking about our government
[01:10.280 --> 01:16.400]  giving al-Qaeda terrorist weapons gee I wonder what General Mr. Garrow is talking
[01:16.400 --> 01:20.800]  about but he has more to say today and he said the general not that we know
[01:20.800 --> 01:29.040]  it's Boykin did not want to go public himself but wanted to go through Jim
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.320]  Garrow and I looked up Jim Garrow he runs heavily in the big Christian circles
[01:33.320 --> 01:36.880]  as General Boykin does the same circles but he will not reveal the source I'm
[01:36.880 --> 01:39.440]  smart enough to know who it is and again people said well why are you
[01:39.440 --> 01:43.840]  revealing it then you know 99% chance because the NSA and the government
[01:43.840 --> 01:47.040]  already knows I don't live in an illusional world here ladies and
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.640]  gentlemen and I wasn't sworn to secrecy I can just tell who it is so dr. James
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.840]  Garrow PhD is gonna be joining us and then always informative I want to get
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.040]  his take on the entire police state and unconstitutional activities a con

[02:45.960 --> 02:52.760]  of really really wild news going on it just continues to confirm our worst
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.960]  concerns about what's happening in the society I've got reports here where
[02:57.960 --> 03:04.720]  couple facing 60 days in jail for rescuing injured baby deer the message
[03:04.720 --> 03:11.200]  is you don't do anything you sit there in a catatonic state and go along with
[03:11.200 --> 03:17.120]  whatever the system wants that report is up at info wars.com I've got to do a
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.760]  compilation of these in fact I'm going to go back and talk to my video crew
[03:20.760 --> 03:25.240]  about this during the break and we've got to think of all the examples the last
[03:25.240 --> 03:29.640]  month or two I mean there's got to be more than 20 where they say gun owners
[03:29.640 --> 03:36.200]  are Nazis gun owners must be dealt with like Hitler was at CBS News gun owners
[03:36.200 --> 03:43.080]  are the new Klan got everyone in the South is just scum and has to be overcome

[03:46.320 --> 03:52.520]  founding fathers are bad now MSNBC has their people on saying quote Finney
[03:52.520 --> 04:01.480]  says crazy crackers and again they want racial division in this country and I
[04:01.480 --> 04:09.200]  saw that article out of Newsweek last week Pierce Pressure I've talked about
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.840]  so much where it says the fight is not only brown and black against white now
[04:12.840 --> 04:17.480]  but our friends the Communist Chinese will help and so will Pierce Morgan it's
[04:17.480 --> 04:22.240]  globalism against the evil Southerners and Alex Jones let him prepare his
[04:22.240 --> 04:28.000]  flamethrower he's going down I mean these are the revolutionaries and again
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.600]  they don't want people living in peace they don't want it to be about ideas of
[04:31.600 --> 04:36.400]  liberty and freedom it's your racist cuz you want to own guns and property you're
[04:36.400 --> 04:39.840]  like what's it have to do with it shut up racist we're gonna arrest you for that

[08:10.820 --> 08:13.520]  network
[08:13.520 --> 08:31.600]  we are living on the edge of a designed controlled implosion they open three
[08:31.600 --> 08:39.520]  new coal-powered plants a week in communist China we are not allowed to
[08:39.520 --> 08:45.560]  open one new one a year in fact just this week multiple coal-powered plants we
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.480]  covered this on Monday were shut down more modern plants that are extremely
[08:50.480 --> 08:56.280]  clean and a new one that had been built over the last five years has
[08:56.280 --> 09:01.040]  officially been told they're not allowed to open on the Texas coast there was a
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.240]  supply Houston Corpus Christi and surrounding areas we now have to buy
[09:06.240 --> 09:13.480]  our power from Mexico that's on record who have completely dirty coal burning
[09:13.480 --> 09:17.960]  plants but again their globalist owned you see everything is about shutting us
[09:17.960 --> 09:23.200]  down with taxes and regulations and red tape so you can only operate in India
[09:23.200 --> 09:30.480]  and China and Mexico and it doesn't build up those people it actually lowers
[09:30.480 --> 09:37.560]  their standard of living on average as well don't look at it China has a lower
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.400]  standard of living Mexico has a lower standard of living India has a lower
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.400]  standard of living for the general population and they try to cook those
[09:46.400 --> 09:53.040]  numbers but it's clear that's why just in 2011 something like 48,000 farmers
[09:53.040 --> 09:57.760]  committed suicide in India and it was some huge number last year as well the
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.920]  official tallies aren't out yet statistics always come out six months to a
[10:01.920 --> 10:06.680]  year later Mexico don't tell you about Mexico its economy just the worst it's
[10:06.680 --> 10:13.120]  ever been close to 60,000 deaths the last five years this is the incredible
[10:13.120 --> 10:20.160]  situation that the world is facing and the globalist use poverty as a control
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.800]  mechanism let me just go over some of the headlines that we're going to be
[10:24.800 --> 10:27.920]  covering today and then I'm going to go to your calls because I'm shaking the
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.080]  show up because I like taking your calls ahead of the two big guests we've got
[10:32.080 --> 10:34.760]  joining us today I'll tell you about at the bottom of the hour they're also
[10:34.760 --> 10:40.000]  linked up on the front page of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com if
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.440]  you want to read more about the guests and some of the other issues we're going
[10:42.440 --> 10:47.920]  to be covering we've got more military and police drills terrorizing people
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.040]  first it was Miami and then Houston with the army and now it's going on in
[10:53.040 --> 10:59.600]  Chicago woman sues police over flash grenades swat raid to the wrong house
[10:59.600 --> 11:05.400]  police state gone wild couple facing 60 days in jail for rescuing injured baby
[11:05.400 --> 11:11.480]  dear Charlie Daniels as the nanny state politicos of this president will
[11:11.480 --> 11:17.200]  result in chaos and bloodshed that's the plan who runs the world solid proof a
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.800]  core group of wealthy elitist is pulling the strings I want to go over that
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.600]  article later it's pretty powerful you know you're no longer living in a free
[11:25.600 --> 11:28.720]  country when I've got to get to that article because it just goes through
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.920]  it's just just the latest amazing trampling of liberty
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.000]  fluoridation ends in another major city after 51 years of some good news on
[11:38.000 --> 11:47.040]  that front MSNBC's Finney rips crazy crackers on the right for very hateful
[11:47.040 --> 11:52.200]  language and again this is all about the so-called left who are really nothing
[11:52.200 --> 11:59.160]  more than authoritarians absolutely going crazy and getting in everyone's
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.680]  face and saying you're a racist you're bad if you don't accept higher taxes if
[12:03.680 --> 12:08.280]  you don't turn your guns in if you don't take force inoculations they now call
[12:08.280 --> 12:19.800]  racist for everything or everything and again it's a gang mentality and it's not
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.680]  even so-called minorities who are really the majority in this country now who are
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.760]  the ones pushing it it is the social engineers who want to divide Americans
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.760]  against each other I mean I see Obama supporters walking around and I talked to
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.160]  them as I see their their button pins or their bumper stickers and I talked to some
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.200]  yesterday in a parking lot I was with my son and I said hey I see you have an
[12:42.200 --> 12:45.880]  Obama sticker and they looked at me with a please look smiling the lady went
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.480]  Alex Jones and I went so you you feel like you're winning right now because
[12:51.480 --> 12:57.400]  of Obama she goes well he's better than Romney it was a older Hispanic lady
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.400]  with her husband and I said really I mean he raised your payroll taxes he lied
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.280]  about that and he he's very deceptive she's like oh whatever you're just mad you
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.320]  lost and it's always the same thing it's like feeling like hey I won you know my
[13:12.320 --> 13:18.000]  football team won or my guy won while he is a total globalist let me explain
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.440]  this people they've shut down over 200 power plants in the first four years of
[13:22.440 --> 13:27.960]  his administration they're set to quote shut down massive numbers more some
[13:27.960 --> 13:34.320]  estimates over a thousand that's about half of what we've got left now if you
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.120]  think the economy is bad now and the GDP shrinking now folks you ain't seen
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.680]  nothing yet and let me tell you the social engineers it's all in agenda 21
[13:43.680 --> 13:50.640]  it's all in the big sociology papers that we covered you know last week with
[13:50.640 --> 13:59.280]  Dr. Corsi in studio there it is industry group 204 coal power plants to be
[13:59.280 --> 14:05.920]  closed in next five years and what is that out of because that's a that's the
[14:05.920 --> 14:09.200]  environmental leader and when did they come out with that report well that's
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.720]  September 20 at 2012 they've already closed 200 plants what are they talking
[14:14.720 --> 14:19.160]  about I guess that's just their their estimate on on what what more is going
[14:19.160 --> 14:22.400]  to be closed regardless they already shut down 200 they said they're shutting
[14:22.400 --> 14:25.800]  down 200 more estimates I see as many as a thousand because see they say oh you
[14:25.800 --> 14:29.680]  can stay open just do these things but then that bankrupts you which you've
[14:29.680 --> 14:34.000]  all seen the clip or maybe you haven't in fact we're gonna play later the clip
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  of the racist stuff first but can you guys just pull up on YouTube the Obama
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.760]  we're gonna bankrupt coal clip from five years ago thanks I don't want to just I'm
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.840]  getting neurotic about I don't want to just say that and listeners go yeah right
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.680]  I want to I want you to hear Obama saying you can have a coal power plant
[14:49.680 --> 14:52.880]  we're gonna bankrupt you you know we've got enough clean burning coal that means
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.720]  it's absolutely clean without even having all the expensive scrubbers to run
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.520]  this country for over a hundred years and the studies they did in 1997 when
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.120]  Clinton laid off millions of acres in southern Utah and into one other state
[15:05.120 --> 15:10.200]  of the only clean burning coal in the world other than a field in Mongolia
[15:10.200 --> 15:13.680]  China that the Chinese developed and guess what the company that was given
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.800]  the state rights to that a year before guess what happened to their stock in
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.120]  the week after Clinton signed an executive order in 97 knocking it off
[15:21.120 --> 15:29.680]  limits their stock doubled their stock doubled you see the real way the
[15:29.680 --> 15:36.280]  globalist make money is they just shut down hundreds of plants not owned by
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.880]  globalist and then that makes their profits go up because you've got to buy
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.040]  it from them and they can gouge you I mean this is so elementary put rules on
[15:45.040 --> 15:48.600]  where nobody can have a factory here in the US it moves to China only globalist
[15:48.600 --> 15:51.840]  insiders who made the deals when they put Mao into power and then officially
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.800]  made the deal in 75 when Nixon went there in 76 sent his minions earlier than
[15:56.800 --> 16:05.200]  that I guess Nixon went like 72 my point is is that even after that happened the
[16:05.200 --> 16:10.320]  issue is ladies and gentlemen is that this is a full takeover and then they
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.840]  can go and operate and it's total and whenever Bush was in Republicans were
[16:15.840 --> 16:18.480]  like I don't care if he tortures I don't care their secret arrest I don't care
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.200]  what they do I'm feeling good my guys in I'm like don't you understand he's a
[16:22.200 --> 16:27.200]  globalist they had that same look of satisfaction shut up liberal I'm like
[16:27.200 --> 16:31.440]  no no no he's a puppet it's an agenda we've got to get and now the left is I've
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.640]  got to say probably three times worse I mean they do not care what Obama does
[16:36.640 --> 16:41.240]  they can he can raise their taxes he can go back on promises and go after their
[16:41.240 --> 16:46.000]  guns he can do all of that and they don't care because he's their guy and
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.120]  their winners through him reflected glory and it's the Cretus Flaves it really
[16:52.120 --> 17:02.000]  gets to me we have the Obama cold video here he is in 2008 on television here it
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.960]  is so if somebody wants to build a coal power plant they can it's just that it
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.840]  will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that
[17:11.840 --> 17:20.600]  greenhouse gas that's being emitted so there you go and so yeah they've shut
[17:20.600 --> 17:23.680]  200 and something down they said they're going to shut down 200 more few
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.360]  months ago the numbers I've got is by some industry analysts it's over a
[17:27.360 --> 17:34.240]  thousand because you won't be able to operate and people like good I don't want
[17:34.240 --> 17:39.320]  those rich guys make money off coal folks and then when I talk about this oh you
[17:39.320 --> 17:43.400]  must own coal stock or be with the coal industry I've never gotten one red cent
[17:43.400 --> 17:48.960]  from anybody involved in any petrochemicals coal distillates anything
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.720]  zero let me tell you though Austin is the model of the Western world we get a
[17:54.720 --> 17:59.320]  UN awards were the official model city of agenda 21 we even beat San Francisco out
[17:59.320 --> 18:04.640]  last year they'll look it up the only other city was like one other Japanese
[18:04.640 --> 18:14.760]  cities our sister city they got the co-award look it up and our price is
[18:14.760 --> 18:19.360]  you can look this up have roughly doubled the last four plus years and now

[18:23.280 --> 18:26.960]  upgraded about a decade ago the Fayetteville plant one of the biggest in
[18:26.960 --> 18:32.160]  the state they're set to shut it down works perfectly sitting right there
[18:32.160 --> 18:41.120]  city owns it incredibly valuable asset they want it shut down and the mayor
[18:41.120 --> 18:48.720]  said this is for the earth a few months ago and again I've got all this news

[24:41.000 --> 24:46.400]  ultra negative if you go into the doctor and they say you've got a compound
[24:46.400 --> 24:50.120]  fracture your bones sticking out of your leg we've got to do a surgery and fix
[24:50.120 --> 24:58.000]  that it's not negative you're you're at the hospital you're getting aid and the
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.960]  politicians are like we're gonna get you more welfare we're gonna get you more
[25:00.960 --> 25:07.720]  food stamps and their own official policies that we've covered at nauseam
[25:07.720 --> 25:13.440]  are to deindustrialize us under the treaty that we're signed on to agenda
[25:13.440 --> 25:23.680]  2021 and the cover is it's for the environment and it's so criminal that
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.080]  my own city council is the model of this number four years ago they are three
[25:28.080 --> 25:31.200]  and a half years ago they couldn't get the carbon taxes rammed through
[25:31.200 --> 25:34.360]  officially at the Copenhagen Denmark UN meeting because all those documents were
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.200]  coming out how they were really planning to destroy economies and carry out
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.560]  eugenics and how the third world had to have right at double the cuts even the
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.280]  West did and that was a death sentence not just a death sentence for the
[25:48.280 --> 25:52.760]  economy death sentence for people and Schwarzenegger said I will lead you can
[25:52.760 --> 25:57.040]  pull this up I will lead the move and the UN plan to take over the cities and
[25:57.040 --> 26:02.000]  the states in the nation's days will not do it they were already doing that
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.680]  program it's called UN immunization standardized tied to federal HUD funds in
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.280]  our country similar funds in Europe and other areas and they come in with hey
[26:12.280 --> 26:18.080]  here's $50 million for your little town if you agree to pass ordinances that all
[26:18.080 --> 26:20.880]  these people can't build on their property you can only build on this
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.040]  property and then the maps are drawn with a local boss hall good ol boys so
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.680]  they get to keep their land and the globalists get to come in and do deals
[26:28.680 --> 26:33.960]  with them I mean it's very simple you shut off power plants your power plants
[26:33.960 --> 26:40.520]  make more money you shut off industry but only your industry gets to operate now
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.880]  you've got a monopoly you shut off other people's real estate your real estate
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.000]  increases in price that's how the globalist make their money and their
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.640]  control that's their big secret and so as things shut down they say don't worry
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.080]  we got welfare for you oh food stamps went from 25 million to almost 50 million
[26:59.080 --> 27:03.240]  now they're gonna be a hundred million and it's the same in Europe the same all
[27:03.240 --> 27:11.360]  over the world this is an exact program and we've talked about it forever but
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.480]  people need to understand it's now gonna get very very bad I'm gonna come back
[27:17.480 --> 27:20.280]  and go to your calls in a long segment that's coming up but look at this US
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.960]  economy unexpectedly contracts in fourth quarter I mean give me a break folks
[27:24.960 --> 27:29.800]  they knew that all the things they're doing with contract the economy and wait
[27:29.800 --> 27:36.000]  until all the payroll taxes increasing goes into place wait until all the
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.640]  thousands of major businesses who wrote the health care law lower people down to
[27:41.640 --> 27:48.120]  25 hours a week instead of 40 so they get out of the Obamacare now it'll show
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.280]  an uptick in employment because they're gonna count people working extra jobs as
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.880]  new jobs but you're not gonna have as much money and it doesn't matter though
[27:56.880 --> 28:02.080]  you can just get starry-eyed and go but I got Obama in he loves me he hates the
[28:02.080 --> 28:07.840]  rich people US economy unexpectedly contracts in fourth quarter the average
[28:07.840 --> 28:10.560]  person's getting hundreds of dollars more out of their paycheck every month
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.960]  taking out other paychecks some estimates are as high as $200 for people
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.120]  making like 30,000 a year I mean this is just this is the difference between
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.560]  getting enough groceries and then people love their servitude though because
[28:24.560 --> 28:30.440]  they've been dumbed down and it just goes on here it just goes on here with
[28:30.440 --> 28:39.200]  the headlines US debt headed towards 200% of GDP even after fiscal cliff deal
[28:39.200 --> 28:51.600]  think about that think about how think about how crazy that is the debt
[28:51.600 --> 29:00.960]  yearly will be 200% of GDP that means you're making let's say $50,000 a year
[29:00.960 --> 29:07.480]  and your debt is a hundred thousand dollars are you gonna be in a good
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.360]  position no you're gonna be a debt slave who was put into this position and it
[29:12.360 --> 29:17.960]  makes me so angry to now see our country's credit rating being devalued
[29:17.960 --> 29:20.800]  just like they've done to European nations like Greece and when they're
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.280]  done that's where we're going to be and they'll be up there promising more
[29:24.280 --> 29:30.000]  government more taxes to give to people who had their factories and jobs shipped
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.120]  overseas and their jobs here destroyed with red tape with the streets teeming
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.960]  with paramilitary police checkpoints gun owners or terrorists and the government
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.280]  then hiring not just putting the welfare folks on welfare now recruiting them as

[33:22.400 --> 33:28.880]  us last night I listened to a little bit of the rebroadcast of the show via the
[33:28.880 --> 33:36.040]  streams the audio streams at present planet calm I clicked on them and I was
[33:36.040 --> 33:40.720]  listening to my 15 minute rant towards the end of the third hour about the plan
[33:40.720 --> 33:47.480]  to fully convert our society over to an automated technocratic technocracy that's
[33:47.480 --> 33:52.680]  in the words of this is a big Brazilian ski back in the 70s in one of his books
[33:52.680 --> 33:59.480]  I read I forget all the titles of them think it was the technotronic age point
[33:59.480 --> 34:05.080]  is is that they planned all this and you got a hand it to them what they
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.000]  envisioned 30 40 50 years ago they did I mean I read stuff Bertrand Russell wrote
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.400]  Nobel Prize winner was it for literature wrote in the 30s and I mean it's
[34:15.400 --> 34:26.880]  what's happening now take Aldous Huxley he wrote in 1932 Brave New World and then
[34:26.880 --> 34:31.680]  of course he gave a speech in 61 62 before he died at Berkeley it's online
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.840]  you can go listen to it just type Aldous Huxley's Berkeley speech where he said
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.760]  this book is what I believe would really happen being in the highest levels of
[34:40.760 --> 34:46.760]  scientific intelligentsia growing up in London and of course his brother founded
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.520]  UNESCO at the UN which is the real head of the UN
[34:52.160 --> 34:57.400]  Julian Huxley and I cover it in the endgame it just this is not my opinion
[34:57.400 --> 35:01.240]  and I go back to this caller who was calling about how they're replacing
[35:01.240 --> 35:05.080]  their Air Force base with drones in Arkansas and he just said yeah they're
[35:05.080 --> 35:09.280]  getting rid of the our guess is army base it was a 10s and he just hung up
[35:09.280 --> 35:13.000]  sound sounding depressed and I realized if you just tune in and you hear all
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.920]  this you either think it's crazy because it is crazy but it's I'm not the one
[35:17.920 --> 35:23.400]  doing it I know it sounds crazy reality is crazy truth is strange with the
[35:23.400 --> 35:31.200]  fiction has been said a billion times and I don't go over all this just to
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.200]  demoralize people I do it so people know about it so that we're not
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.280]  compartmentalized and so we can see through the wall next to us and then
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.640]  through the next wall and the next wall and realize we're all in this together
[35:44.640 --> 35:49.680]  man I don't care if you're some foolish cop running any illegal checkpoint I
[35:49.680 --> 35:56.040]  pull up to and it's happened I'm not even mad at you anymore I'm mainly
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.200]  frustrated because I know the whole program basically I know how you're
[36:00.200 --> 36:04.080]  programmed I know you're compartmentalized and if I throw a fit and
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.320]  start yelling at you it's because I'm sick of it it'd be like if I was trying
[36:09.320 --> 36:12.480]  to get out of a burning house and I came to the door and you're there going
[36:12.480 --> 36:16.560]  I'm not gonna let you out and I'm like do you see the fire and the smoke no I
[36:16.560 --> 36:24.280]  don't conspiracy theorist I'm like listen all I just I don't even know what to
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.880]  say anymore they're unplugging our power plants they're shutting our entire
[36:29.880 --> 36:35.280]  industry down that they're writing books and laws and white papers about it
[36:35.280 --> 36:43.400]  they're evil they're evil I want to stop them don't you care people say what
[36:43.400 --> 36:46.720]  do we do and you know I guess that's the point we've reached is there's so many
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.080]  criminals and so many positions of power and then so many yes men and women
[36:51.080 --> 36:58.120]  beneath them and I guess that's why they're so confident
[36:58.120 --> 37:04.680]  to now just be out on the open with so much of this I mean our country they
[37:04.680 --> 37:12.560]  are trying to hold us under the water and then somebody else walks along says
[37:12.560 --> 37:15.280]  hey it looks like you're trying to drown that person oh no I'm trying to help get
[37:15.280 --> 37:19.520]  them out of the water sure looks like you're holding their head under and then
[37:19.520 --> 37:23.800]  I'll walk over and you'll pick up their notebook says here you plan to drown them
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.680]  here today you know you wrote you were gonna oh no I'm not doing that you're
[37:27.680 --> 37:33.520]  holding them under oh okay well I see you later Bob guess them have fun what
[37:33.520 --> 37:39.440]  you're doing then later I'll walk back by there's a dead body floating and I see
[37:39.440 --> 37:45.840]  Bob later and he goes oh no he's not dead he's just relaxing he's got gills walk
[37:45.840 --> 37:49.280]  back by two days later there's buzzards over on the side of the water eating the
[37:49.280 --> 37:56.760]  dead body oh no he's not dead he's been liberated I mean you have to be crazy to
[37:56.760 --> 38:04.860]  buy in to what these people are doing and it just blows me away to see them
[38:04.860 --> 38:12.920]  totally dismantling our entire country and they're selling legalizing the
[38:12.920 --> 38:19.160]  illegal aliens as a way to fix the economy and again nothing against the
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.320]  people that are here I know most of these people are hard-working smart folks
[38:22.320 --> 38:29.320]  who come from a great tyranny the problem is when by the time they vote over
[38:29.320 --> 38:35.040]  90% in the polls and studies up there you look it up vote for socialism because
[38:35.040 --> 38:38.560]  they see the government as their friend because it told them they were their
[38:38.560 --> 38:43.720]  friend when they're really brought here to be brought into the system inculcated
[38:43.720 --> 38:51.360]  and to get government services to be new dependents and the illegals becoming
[38:51.360 --> 38:57.720]  citizens on average will vote to take our guns and they will vote to
[38:57.720 --> 39:01.400]  collectivize and they will vote as long as they get a goodie from the
[39:01.400 --> 39:07.040]  government same thing with the domesticated American people and
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.040]  conservatives and libertarians say well things will collapse you're idiots
[39:11.040 --> 39:17.160]  they're not idiots the power structure is set up to consolidate the control as
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.960]  we collapse and look I know I talk about this at nauseam but I will not
[39:20.960 --> 39:27.200]  apologize for it in closing and I'm going to your calls so I'm listening to the
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.240]  show last night to about 20 minutes of it or so just dialing in on the iPhone
[39:33.240 --> 39:37.000]  app sitting over my smartphone laying in bed at 10 at night or whatever it was
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.760]  and I'm listening to the end of the third hour where I'm ranting about the
[39:41.760 --> 39:46.280]  technocracy and I'm angry at myself because there's all these other points
[39:46.280 --> 39:49.560]  I should have made and I could have if I was calm and I'm thinking about it all
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.160]  but then I listen to the old guy calling in from Arkansas at the end of the call
[39:54.160 --> 40:00.680]  signing just bummed out and that's not what I'm trying to do I'm just trying to
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.880]  get you to become aware of what's going on because here's the deal the arcade
[40:05.880 --> 40:11.360]  I'm pro technology the problem is the architecture of the way technology is
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.800]  being rolled out through federal and global regulations in concert with the
[40:15.800 --> 40:23.360]  dozen or so major 15 or so major technology companies is to put backdoor
[40:23.360 --> 40:30.640]  Trojan horses in to control and track everything we do outside of law and
[40:30.640 --> 40:34.320]  that's why there's new articles out about all the wireless devices and
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.680]  computers have security flaws backdoors no matter what company it is these are
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.600]  built in how that happened they're designed for the NSA for the police for
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.960]  Google to break into your computer Google got caught two years ago driving
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.160]  around with cars all over the world hacking your computers but they weren't
[40:52.160 --> 40:59.840]  hacking them they had the keys they are the NSA and again they're building this
[40:59.840 --> 41:07.840]  whole technocracy to phase out humanity we are obsolete and in the words of the
[41:07.840 --> 41:14.680]  global technocrats well I say the tyrants are obsolete and this is a huge
[41:14.680 --> 41:18.440]  power trip for them to be building this huge program to have envisioned this
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.800]  huge program and their their response is you know if you're reading this because
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.800]  it's in some of their books and white papers you're thinking it's immoral notice
[41:27.800 --> 41:35.840]  that no one's opposing us because they're dumb animals and then they built a
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.720]  system to make people act like dumb animals from birth the television the
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.160]  dumbing down the chemicals it's so diabolical and it's all for full control
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.880]  and to put this into full control I mean again I talk about smart meters 10
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.240]  years ago more than 10 years ago with with engineers and people I mean I
[41:55.240 --> 42:00.000]  would have retired engineers on who who were young who had left these companies
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.320]  I mean you a lot of you heard the interviews warning about I mean Tex Mars
[42:04.320 --> 42:11.040]  who's a engineer Air Force officer scientist you know best-selling books
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.880]  ever on robots I guess a technology futurist for the Air Force before it
[42:16.880 --> 42:22.200]  became a space and aeronautics professor at UT I read his book project lucid
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.520]  like in 95 when it came out and it was about the smart meters and microchips
[42:27.520 --> 42:33.800]  and smart dust and RFID and then you know I later people a decade later
[42:33.800 --> 42:39.800]  breaking the news I mean this is all very old stuff and you warn people about
[42:39.800 --> 42:48.680]  this and they go oh that's never gonna happen you know my laptop isn't
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.720]  watching me I mean I've had family years ago 10 years ago at my house they'd
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.600]  say why is your laptop computer covered why do you have a piece of tape over it
[42:58.600 --> 43:03.240]  you know the built-in camera when that when they were first starting to do that
[43:03.240 --> 43:08.120]  I'd say because they watch you oh yeah yeah now it's just all admitted you know
[43:08.120 --> 43:11.600]  it's public see see how far we've come and I know I'm ranting I'll go to your
[43:11.600 --> 43:22.560]  calls it's just that all this evil is already there and denying it only gives
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.600]  it power and now that you're not a denial I don't want you to get scared I
[43:26.600 --> 43:30.520]  want you to get aggressive because we can educate people there can be a huge
[43:30.520 --> 43:35.960]  turning against this a flipping and it's starting to happen and people can just
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.280]  refuse this you know women are standing up the smart meters because at an
[43:40.280 --> 43:45.160]  instinctive level they know it's dangerous and bad and they know that all
[43:45.160 --> 43:48.960]  the new appliances dial into it and they're wondering why every new
[43:48.960 --> 43:54.240]  appliance they buy has smart meter wireless pickups in it and your TV does
[43:54.240 --> 43:58.640]  and your computer does and they admit they're using it to track everything you
[43:58.640 --> 44:03.080]  do and even controlling your thermostat and they're doing test women are
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.200]  sitting there in their houses watching the thermostat change and they call the
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.840]  power company and they go we're just doing some test yeah to some test to see
[44:11.840 --> 44:16.880]  if you go along with it I mean it's so diabolical the government's watching you
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.080]  they're molesting you at the airports they're controlling your your your
[44:21.080 --> 44:30.440]  thermostat and folks this is just the beginning show again the people at the
[44:30.440 --> 44:36.960]  other end of these computers are very bad and their plan is to build an
[44:36.960 --> 44:42.240]  electronic prison around you for your orderly death and I know that sounds
[44:42.240 --> 44:47.800]  incredible but it's on record that they plan to do this and I'm begging all of
[44:47.800 --> 44:51.600]  you to realize none of you are safe they're already attacking you all
[44:51.600 --> 44:55.840]  they're spraying stuff it's in the food it's in the water everybody's sick even
[44:55.840 --> 44:58.520]  when they're taking vitamins and minerals to fight it people like that are
[44:58.520 --> 45:02.680]  doing okay those that aren't are walking dead the cancer rates are exploding
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.720]  this is real
[45:05.720 --> 45:17.360]  let's go ahead and talk to DC in Ohio DC you're on the air hey Alex how are you
[45:17.360 --> 45:23.200]  doing today I'm doing all right brother all right hey first-time caller and a
[45:23.200 --> 45:29.720]  first-time listener of the show I'm an ex Navy during the first Gulf War when
[45:29.720 --> 45:34.040]  Papa Bush was even talking about the New World Order at that time I'm an ex
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.080]  mortgage broker when the government was giving away loans to everybody with bad
[45:39.080 --> 45:45.320]  credit so we all get in houses before the stock market crashed and now a father
[45:45.320 --> 45:50.640]  of three I'm a byproduct of the economic disaster of the middle class I can't
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.560]  if I'm on food stamps I can't afford gas I take public transportation and now I'm
[45:56.560 --> 46:01.960]  just super concerned about everything that's going on with the billions of
[46:01.960 --> 46:06.560]  dollars taken out of the Federal Reserve the army tactics they're going on in
[46:06.560 --> 46:14.080]  Miami and in Houston and and it's got to stop we got to fight the fight well I
[46:14.080 --> 46:16.880]  mean I just want all the bureaucrats and everybody else to know I mean they're
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.960]  all on a power trip just like the Obama supporters it's so infantile it's like
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.880]  when you're three years old and you know you you feel secure around your dad and
[46:26.880 --> 46:29.920]  your dad's talking to the neighbor and you're standing there by your dad's leg
[46:29.920 --> 46:33.920]  and you you look over and lean your cheek up against your dad and just oh my
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.040]  daddy's so tough my daddy's so strong everybody who's out of father remembers
[46:38.040 --> 46:43.720]  that feeling that's the same feeling government lovers get is they just look
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.720]  at you with this satisfied look I see it in the cops beating up people with
[46:47.720 --> 46:51.280]  video cameras on the street or going in people's houses without warrants the
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.720]  cops just have this satisfied look there's nothing you're gonna do I'm back
[46:56.720 --> 47:00.680]  you know I got the people back at the headquarters back in me and it's a
[47:00.680 --> 47:04.480]  satisfaction well I want you to know something the people running this are
[47:04.480 --> 47:08.880]  killing you and your family you dumb government bureaucrats you're walking
[47:08.880 --> 47:14.960]  dad they're eugenicists they're killing you I'm sorry go ahead oh no I was gonna
[47:14.960 --> 47:19.400]  say I've been pulled over so many times in the last two years because of the
[47:19.400 --> 47:22.840]  scanners that they put on the police vehicles the scanner they could scan
[47:22.840 --> 47:26.960]  hundreds of license plates as they go down the street and then anybody who has
[47:26.960 --> 47:32.360]  a warrant they pull over or anybody who has priors they pull over you know asking
[47:32.360 --> 47:37.080]  to a breathalyzer for for what you know and again and again they act like it's
[47:37.080 --> 47:40.920]  not there when I pulled through the border patrol checkpoint at alpine when I
[47:40.920 --> 47:45.080]  went down to I'm gonna play this today we've had it ready for a week but I've
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.640]  been so busy I'll either air today or on the nightly news tonight but but the
[47:50.640 --> 47:54.200]  point is I pulled the portal checkpoint they obviously know who I am they're all
[47:54.200 --> 47:57.840]  looking I've been through there before of other checkpoints and they're all
[47:57.840 --> 48:04.120]  about to pull me over to the secondary search area we're always refused and he
[48:04.120 --> 48:07.040]  goes why are you videotaping me and I said you're videotaping me and they're
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.120]  like no we're not and I'm like really what are all these video cameras and the
[48:11.120 --> 48:17.040]  guy smiles it's like a mind game and and yeah they've got these these robot
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.960]  cameras scanning us but you listen you know the secret of Patriots now Patriots
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.080]  are now going to Mexico or buying Mexican cars with Mexican plates I'm
[48:26.080 --> 48:31.320]  thinking about doing it I'm gonna be honest and you become God they don't
[48:31.320 --> 48:36.040]  scan you they don't read you nothing I'm serious I'm thinking about changing my
[48:36.040 --> 48:42.440]  name to like Juan Gonzalez and get in a Mexican car folks I'm not joking I mean
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.080]  I may do this as an experiment legally change my name still be Alex Jones in
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.840]  the air but legally have the name Juan Gonzalez and I'm gonna get Mexican cars
[48:49.840 --> 48:55.520]  and I'm God I mean I will be God level at that point until they fully bring the
[48:55.520 --> 48:58.840]  US down and then close the trap on everybody they brought in but what is
[48:58.840 --> 49:03.000]  that 510 years who knows I mean can you believe that illegal aliens are God and
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.520]  I'm going I'm serious I've advised my crew because you try to stay outside the
[49:07.520 --> 49:10.960]  system you know your license expired you try to stay out of their grid they
[49:10.960 --> 49:14.700]  attack citizens with a savage hate but let me tell you you get the Mexican
[49:14.700 --> 49:18.520]  plates God level they're now putting out fake Mexican plates that people are
[49:18.520 --> 49:21.840]  using and the scanners don't touch him and the cops leave you alone because
[49:21.840 --> 49:25.480]  they've been told that is that's there to bring down the economy drive down the
[49:25.480 --> 49:29.840]  wages and vote to take the guns that's a God leave a God alone well I declare
[49:29.840 --> 49:35.680]  myself an Olympian God I declare myself Juan Gonzalez and I am God I mean I am
[49:35.680 --> 49:39.040]  God of the police now I can start drinking and driving I can start not
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.880]  having insurance it's over what do you think of that plan that's an awesome plan
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.480]  and I'm a lucky one because I can't afford the smart TVs and the smart
[49:50.480 --> 49:56.400]  computers and all the smart technology that's out yeah 10 years ago Mercedes
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.800]  had the thumb scanners to get your car you pay to be a slave sorry go ahead no
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.280]  that's alright and look what the Superdome is named after Mercedes Ben
[50:04.280 --> 50:10.840]  Superdome now and I'm concerned about the Super Bowl coming up because both of
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.760]  those army drills were held one in Houston 810 leads right to our interstate
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.840]  10 leads right to New Orleans and the same with Miami are coming over from
[50:21.840 --> 50:27.120]  Florida the other road coming right in there is is the interstate 10 and they
[50:27.120 --> 50:31.760]  still have all those housing there from Katrina Katrina Katrina that was a
[50:31.760 --> 50:39.840]  man-made disaster yeah hey do you like the Juan Gonzalez show I love KC I love
[50:39.840 --> 50:44.240]  the Juan Gonzalez and again all I gotta do is Mexican cars everywhere I mean the
[50:44.240 --> 50:47.200]  parking lot out here has got a couple one of the guys that has this big
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.200]  scientific company next door he's he's a white guy I've talked to him he's not
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.240]  from Mexico got a brand new Mercedes Mexican plates I'm telling you man it's
[50:55.240 --> 51:02.520]  the new diplomatic immunity I can become a god yes this is Alex Jones with five
[51:02.520 --> 51:06.760]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[54:45.840 --> 54:49.280]  not joking we were just talking the illegals can drive without catalytic
[54:49.280 --> 54:55.160]  converters no inspections no insurance no registration and are just left alone and
[54:55.160 --> 54:59.120]  I think that's good I mean I I think citizens should have the book thrown at
[54:59.120 --> 55:02.760]  them and be stomped into the ground I support the new world order I think it's
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.200]  good they're shutting down our power plants our GDPs contracting we're about
[55:07.200 --> 55:13.560]  to have a double of the deficit every year than money we even bring in hey what
[55:13.560 --> 55:16.600]  happened in Greece is a great thing we're going there government loves us I
[55:16.600 --> 55:20.480]  think it's great Obama raised taxes on poorest Americans and their payroll
[55:20.480 --> 55:24.640]  taxes and I think it's good everybody's gonna get cut to basically part time now
[55:24.640 --> 55:27.760]  because he loves you and the government cares about you so let's turn our guns
[55:27.760 --> 55:33.720]  in and trust them don't be an extremist Thomas you're on the air you say you
[55:33.720 --> 55:39.320]  support Obama or did support him you're a WLUV 1520 listener there in
[55:39.320 --> 55:47.280]  Chicago go ahead Thomas I'm pretty good I just realized I'm about to become
[55:47.280 --> 55:52.440]  above the law I'm about to anyway sorry go ahead no no no problem I I definitely
[55:52.440 --> 55:55.160]  would listen to the Wongan Valley show you know I think that'd be a god-level
[55:55.160 --> 55:59.760]  radio show where we bow kind of like a Muslim out towards mecca we bowed
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.160]  towards the radio we'd all be immune from all the all the speed traps and
[56:04.160 --> 56:07.960]  traffic tickets and parking tickets yeah see we have a big old fiesta why not
[56:07.960 --> 56:12.480]  why I'm gonna tell us hey I think all Americans can do it that's the answer of
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.680]  course I can't go to Mexico and be above the law or go there and have my kids
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.320]  paid for with free free you know birth and stuff but but that's okay but but
[56:22.320 --> 56:28.240]  but would Mexico accept me though if I had fake ID see Mexico has consul matricula
[56:28.240 --> 56:32.920]  center set up to give fake IDs out would they accept my fake ID I don't think I
[56:32.920 --> 56:37.880]  think they put me in a dirt bottom jail but well that's not fair why why why can't
[56:37.880 --> 56:44.240]  I get everything free down there well Alex the reason why I'm calling cuz I
[56:44.240 --> 56:50.480]  was a former supporter I even went to the inauguration 2008 and now that I
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.680]  look back at it was just years of disdain with President Bush and I didn't
[56:54.680 --> 56:58.800]  know too much about the left-right paradigm at that point it was kind of
[56:58.800 --> 57:03.240]  like um Chicago Bears vs. Green Bay Packers I root for one team I went in
[57:03.240 --> 57:07.220]  or my teeth down and you know I can admit that to myself as a man that I got
[57:07.220 --> 57:11.360]  caught up right in that trap now when you when you start to feel really the
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.120]  uh the onion skin you start to get bigger a little deeper you realize
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.200]  Democrat Republican two sides of the same coin the good Jordan Maxwell quote
[57:19.200 --> 57:22.600]  and you know I've done a lot of awakening in the last six years with mostly
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.600]  with your health and then you can't do it on your own the person might be
[57:26.600 --> 57:31.040]  individual like myself needs to go reach for themselves do the research on their
[57:31.040 --> 57:34.240]  own and that's when you truly start to become awakened because you feel like
[57:34.240 --> 57:37.400]  you're doing it on your own you're not just listening with someone dictating you
[57:37.400 --> 57:41.800]  that's when the stuff really starts to open up and again people say well are
[57:41.800 --> 57:45.880]  you saying vote for Romney no no it's to realize it's all fixed at that level
[57:45.880 --> 57:50.520]  and that it's the same globalist it's just the understanding that it's a scam
[57:50.520 --> 57:53.800]  and they know what people are gonna wake up to that so they want to get
[57:53.800 --> 57:57.880]  everybody dependent so even though you wake up you're still dependent on them
[57:57.880 --> 58:03.040]  so they can run your life correct that's absolutely correct and like the
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.120]  Democratic Party's like the biggest Ponzi's political Ponzi scheme because
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.400]  you got like 18 19-year-olds coming out of high school they want you know do
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.600]  gooders just like I was a blue blood a blue-blooded liberal and then by time
[58:14.600 --> 58:17.680]  you hit your 30s and you figured all out they don't need you anymore they got a
[58:17.680 --> 58:21.840]  million more 18-year-olds the big Democratic Ponzi scheme and I just want
[58:21.840 --> 58:25.760]  to say to all the people are smugging it up all you fake liberals out there

[58:29.120 --> 58:33.440]  yuck ended up with Obama you make me sick because there's nothing liberal about
[58:33.440 --> 58:38.280]  you you're just control free fascist pigs in liberal clothing that's right

[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:07.480]  Americans well that's publicly in the training stuff now so but the fact that
[1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:11.480]  he's a respectable guy and this individual wanted to conduit this info
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:15.880]  through him he has some more info for us today as well and China in the new world

[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:25.360]  the air thanks for holding welcome hey one how are you I'm a long-time listener
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:31.840]  been with you since July of 2002 and I commend you for your great work sir you
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:35.080]  better people just joined us I'm now Juan Gonzalez so I can be exempt from all
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:39.520]  the taxes and regulations and drive and not be pulled over for no reason like a
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:46.880]  US citizen for four years away from the next inauguration of another selected
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:51.400]  president of the United States but I think there's no time better than now
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:56.440]  to call for a patriot plan for presidential election reform I think you
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:02:01.160]  know we need a comprehensive look at the way elections are financed the whole
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:05.480]  primary system and you've spoken to a lot of people over the years you probably
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:09.480]  have a lot more ideas than I do you know what's your what's your take on that
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:13.320]  Ken Ken first off first off people need to have an awakening and realize
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:18.080]  whoever the system pushes in the primaries from both big parties Republican
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:22.000]  and Democrat is going to be a globalist when Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  the biggest contributors to both guys and most of Obama's policies were
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.120]  actually written up by by Mitt Romney I mean getting a break Mitt Romney said
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:35.920]  some good things but he was a globalist pawn and so we have to realize that we
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:40.720]  get 60% turnouts for national elections on average about 8% local locals where
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:44.520]  you can still get in and kind of block the federal system and do some good
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:50.560]  things we need to get foreign money out of politics the globalist only want to
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:54.640]  pass campaign finance to restrict the small individual while empowering the
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:59.600]  offshore globalist and we need to get integrity in the vote again most the
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:04.080]  country has fraudulent electronic voting machines in place now and there's a lot
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:09.280]  of evidence I've had top election fraud people on like Bev Harris clearly the
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:14.120]  fraud was against Perry I mean I mean it was against having one of those mental
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:18.320]  Romney Mitt Romney I'm thinking about Perry because he's saying let's give
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:21.840]  people back their unspent tax money which is another fraud I'm gonna talk
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:27.000]  about later but all of that is going on and really it's just realizing this
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:33.120]  system's bad news but but but it's also hey don't shut down our power plants
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:39.360]  while China gets to have three new ones a week hey don't let illegal aliens be
[1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:44.800]  above the law hey you just point out the corruption and and and say no to it and
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:49.840]  get good share of selected that won't enforce unconstitutional laws I mean I
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:53.920]  mean it's a cornucopia of things but the biggest thing is recognizing
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:58.000]  fundamentally this country's been usurped and taken over by foreign
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.440]  corporate interest in the spirit of 1776 then Alex I would like to see you
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:08.080]  guys you know all the people all you leaders in this movement you know draft
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:11.480]  a document to get this thing going that we do need to get the money out of
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:16.520]  politics you know how about $500 per American no more corporate financing of
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:21.560]  these campaigns and real real reform of the primary like one or two one or two
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:25.320]  shots at it during the during the election season we don't you know I'm in
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:30.560]  New Jersey hours when the time came for me to cast a vote in the primary the
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:34.920]  candidate was already selected our illusion of democracy is a big joke here
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:39.000]  on the East Coast well you're right it's an illusion almost everywhere now and
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  the corruption's just getting more intense but morally and culturally if we
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:47.640]  reject see their mainline Republicans are saying we've accepted globalism we've
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:51.320]  accepted socialism Republicans have to get with the program to get back in
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:54.000]  office well then they're just the Democratic Party there's no point to
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.520]  even elect them but that itself is a giant sigh up hoax we'll be right back

[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:39.680]  of views on YouTube of our interview and Gary Francis interview with him on his
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:44.320]  news program so the good news is this information is getting out to people so I
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.960]  wanted to get him back on also take some phone calls as well again I'm Alex
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:55.920]  Jones your host if you just joined us the question of course is Obama has
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:04.040]  posed a top brass as the litmus test will you fire on US citizens that is the
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:09.240]  litmus test Obama is saying to the top brass will you fire on US citizens and
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:15.400]  again we already have this in the new Army training manual from 2010 that I'll
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:20.560]  go over the numbers for so you can pull it up at army.mil you've already seen
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:24.680]  the drills out there where the military practice is shooting large crowds of
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:29.880]  Americans that's going on in the news almost every day now the urban warfare
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:34.800]  training you saw the gun confiscation in Katrina you saw ABC news where they
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:37.920]  said yeah if you don't turn them in we shoot an American and the police chief
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.560]  says all the guns will be taken known will be allowed to be armed and they're
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:45.960]  there they're training the military to engage us under brigade homeland I mean
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:50.400]  that was in the Army times three and a half years ago I've had kernels on from
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:53.840]  the army admitting you know they were doing gun confiscation drills in
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:03.040]  Arcadia, Iowa that they now run army checkpoints in California, Tennessee but
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:09.200]  a top retired general a quote living military legend and there's been another
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:13.400]  military legend wink wink general Boykin former head of Special Forces has
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:18.120]  come out and said our government's arming al-Qaeda in Libby and Syria we're
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:22.600]  going into a police state our country's in deep trouble he's also in the film
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:28.200]  Behold a Pale Horse that we sell with Charlie Daniels as the host of at
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:32.280]  infowarstore.com that's a side issue but general Boykin is in that I'm guessing
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:35.640]  it's general Boykin our guests will not say that's who told him this but this is
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:40.200]  a credible guy that's why we have Dr. Garrow back on but I wanted him to recap
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:45.160]  go over the basics of the gear up towards despotism I mean who can deny
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:51.440]  that this is really out in the open now with our guest and now he can also make
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:55.200]  some other points that he didn't get to last week and some new information and
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:01.120]  of course he also runs paintpagodagirls.com he's been over in China
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:06.840]  since 1968 with English language schools and so this staff the government
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:11.200]  was trying to forcibly abort their kids also kill already born babies and so he
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:16.280]  started a group in 2000 that say we're 45,000 Chinese girls and I could
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:19.840]  certainly vouch for him because even a member of my crew has adopted Chinese
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:23.840]  girls out of China and as well aware of the pioneering work of paintpagodagirls
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.080]  the group he founded because they they'll die if they're not adopted you
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:34.080]  understand they kill them they kill them so just amazing and of course there's
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:37.640]  more people wanting to adopt kids every year in this country than there are even
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:41.000]  abortions but they never tell the young women at Planned Parenthood you know
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.360]  there's Christian groups that will pay for your whole pregnancy pay for your
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:50.480]  medical bill and depending on the group give you 20 to $50,000 after after you
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:53.760]  have the baby for not killing it you see those billboards up everywhere
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:59.120]  abortion you know need alternatives that's some of the Christian groups and
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:05.720]  then they even try to get you a job afterwards wow so you want to go have a
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:09.040]  have a have an abortion that doubles your chances of cervical and uterine
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:14.520]  cancer going off to left field as always do now major studies have shown per
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:19.440]  abortion or get paid to have the baby and not have it killed oh but Planned
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:24.480]  Parenthood won't tell you that because their goal is to kill their eugenesis
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:29.240]  Margaret Sanger they want to quote kill the black weeds they were founded for
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:33.600]  that but moved on to everybody else of course but oh it doesn't matter they get
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:38.320]  somebody up on MSNBC saying we got to deal with the white crackers so you get
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:41.560]  some street lingo going out there because you know you talk about getting the
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:45.440]  white crackers that's cool that's liberal but oh hey let's not chop up the
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:50.560]  babies shut up racist okay let's go to our guest pink pagoda girls a founder
[1:12:50.560 --> 1:12:56.840]  dr. James Garrow PhD doc recap the intel you've got the other info tell people
[1:12:56.840 --> 1:13:01.440]  what we're facing here you've got the floor well as as you know and I stated
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:07.280]  last week the difficulty is that this is sounding more and more true you know I
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:11.640]  was a little dope for myself I have to be honest with you but more and more the
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:15.320]  evidence coming forward since you know since we were putting it out to the
[1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:19.880]  public and of course you've known this for quite a while but it's just so
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:25.200]  scary what is happening and as you see them march down the roadway to despot
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:32.480]  it is to me it's just mind-boggling but you know this army senior army officer
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:39.720]  retired who came forward and asked me if I would help him put the word out he was
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:44.280]  quite frightful of what was going on in American where things were going in
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:49.960]  terms of the fact that the military were now going to be asked to take action
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:56.080]  against the American public and for doing what for writing for no nothing
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:01.320]  like that it had to do with a scenario of would you in fact fire on people who
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:07.320]  had been in possession of arms had refused to allow confiscation of those
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:12.160]  arms or to lay down those arms which was you know the right to hold under the
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:16.960]  Constitution the Second Amendment you're well aware of that but now would you as
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:23.800]  an officer order your troops to fire if the commander-in-chief you know who you
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:29.280]  have taken an oath to actually obey as commander would you obey that order so
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:34.000]  many have said no I think it's going to come out fairly soon that many people
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.560]  are saying no I've had so many phone calls Alex I got to tell you between
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:43.200]  interviews and all of that I've had so many people phoning me current military
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:50.760]  and a retired military saying thank you thank you for bringing it up well we
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:55.840]  just want to thank you now listen have you talked to the retired quote military
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:00.240]  legend since he wanted you to warn people about this because again I can
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:04.960]  separately figure out who it is myself I can separately you know research the
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:08.320]  information to know that it's already being set up I mean it's publicly being
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:13.680]  set up have you talked to that individual anymore yes I have yes I have it was a
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:19.040]  very short conversation he called me and just said thank you and that was the
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:23.120]  extent of it so if you're if you're going into did you ask him to come
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.720]  forward again no I didn't get that chance in fact all he wanted to do was say
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:32.720]  thank you that's it so he just wanted you to get the info out and he thinks
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:38.640]  he's gonna be safe having you do it instead of him coming out yes yes very
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:44.240]  much he believes that what he's done is quite brilliant from from what I know of
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:50.360]  this person and and what we talked about how it was going to come out and why me
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:56.000]  and everything and to me it seemed to to be not not as if he was a coward in
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  any way and people have said that you know and sent me messages you know that
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.480]  oh he has to stand up he has to come forward actually no he doesn't watch
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:09.920]  Alex where things go in the in the near future and I think you'll appreciate
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:14.560]  that this man was right on with what he did let's face it he was not a dull
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:21.040]  witted somebody who is in it enabled to who are unable to strategize quite a
[1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:28.040]  brilliant map sure now expanding on that I never implied he was a coward I have
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:32.560]  seen some people say that but after you were on last week I began to think
[1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:37.920]  actually it makes sense because Smedley Butler when he exposed the Nazi
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:42.960]  fascist plan working with the Bush's Prescott Bush at the time but he was
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:47.400]  just mid-level in it and a bunch of other people to have a fascist takeover in
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:52.080]  the 30s he went to Congress first and then that's how they rolled it up and
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:58.800]  I've been noticing now that did you see former Senator Hagel say to Obama you
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.920]  can't trust the military you're not in control of the Pentagon they're not
[1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:06.640]  doing what we say because I know the military over and over again is actually
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:10.360]  stopped some of these wars a lot of people say would lead to World War three
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:14.240]  possibly I mean does that tie into what you're saying we should look for in the
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:19.280]  future well I was certainly people are getting it aren't they if if hate if this
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:24.680]  guy says you know this to Obama by way of warning it's a good warning and you
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:31.840]  know the military folks got so many of the rank and file phone me up and say
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:35.000]  you know what we would never turn our guns you kidding if the officers said
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.120]  that to us we turn them on them and that's the message that's kind of going
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:44.960]  out there Obama does not have the support of the military at all he thinks
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:52.000]  he can command and control but the man's living in La La Land well he's
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:58.720]  certainly is Dr. James Garrow PhD joins us from Toronto Canada right now run
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:03.480]  some of the largest English speaking at training schools in China and say 45,000
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:06.640]  plus little Chinese girls that would have been killed or used in medical
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:10.160]  experiments I'm not kidding it's very macabre I want to talk some about how
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:14.320]  they kill those little girls before you leave us so we can you know put a human
[1:18:14.320 --> 1:18:19.440]  face on this and not just have it be a statistic but I've had countless military
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.040]  in fact I could I could scrub the phone calls right now but we're gonna go to
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:26.880]  them later I'm so I'm not going to and open the phones but we'll do that after
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:31.320]  we take some of these calls and say military call in are you being trained
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:34.460]  to take our guns are you being trained for for killing Americans and they'll
[1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:38.480]  call in and say yes indeed we are but again I have the Army training manual
[1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:43.000]  effect I'll pull it up here in a moment for radio and TV of yours I mean this is
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.960]  the new mission and and we're hearing now we got to have troops on the streets
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:51.320]  and all of this but I only see that serving to wake up the police and
[1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:56.760]  military oh amen that's exactly what's happening that's the result there's
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:01.040]  been a total miscalculation on the part of Obama and crew who don't have a
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:06.080]  military mindset they don't understand what loyalty really is and the fact that
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:10.280]  the military lawyer to the American people they really are they believe in
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:14.960]  the role of being a protector to the American public and they want to note
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:19.440]  to the Constitution but listen who's behind the Constitution it is we the
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.160]  people nothing short of that that's it so bottom line these people are
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:27.960]  understanding it there's a huge as I said again I'm gonna say it it's a huge
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:33.520]  miscalculation and I mean if if there were people who had bad intent looking
[1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:38.040]  to control through the military the country this would be certainly a way
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.840]  to march it toward that but mr. Obama has thought so that he would be the one
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:47.720]  that would be able to have the loyalty of the troops and I'm sorry the troops
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:53.320]  are not stupid I want to find out of the retired military legend the general
[1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:58.300]  talked about false flags is he concerned from his sources about the
[1:19:58.300 --> 1:20:03.040]  globalist staging something so they would buy this looking back on 2012 we
[1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:07.080]  ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like hurricane
[1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:11.240]  sandy in the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:15.680]  disastrous economy our hearts go out to those that have lost everything at e

[1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:53.200]  coming from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:58.400]  this is what the counselors psychiatrists the doctors use to look at
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:01.480]  you as to whether you're crazy or not I'm just throwing out a crazy word there
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:06.440]  but there it is and here's what I've put online get ready for the new onslaught
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:11.200]  of insight we'll call it insight from Obamacare the new mental illness it will
[1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:17.920]  fight itself into DSM 5 since the late 90s DSM 4 has been that manual of
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:22.960]  diagnostic of diagnostic so now we have a new one coming out in May well we
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:26.760]  we have a precursor here of what's what's going to be in it whatever it
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:30.840]  defines it'll allow the government to lock you up for an indeterminate length
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.440]  of time label you as something which will result in your inability to own or

[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:22.120]  the die in the manual gsm 5 here's what we have DSM 5 there's something called a
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:27.920]  general anxiety disorder GAO now I'm gonna ask you a question I'm gonna play
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:32.080]  doctor for a second here Alex when you knew you were gonna have me on the
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:35.560]  program we a little bit anxious the first time because you really didn't know

[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.680]  well Alex let me ask you something do you believe that a few thousand years
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:12.640]  ago there was a guy who was killed he was he was murdered he died his body
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:17.720]  was buried and then three days later he was brought to life again do you believe
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:22.320]  that well I know that and I believe that it was Janet Reno said on 60 minutes
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:27.680]  that if you believe in Jesus Christ and that he's real and and his second coming
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:30.880]  you are mentally ill and this has always been their plan they're going to say
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:34.440]  we're mentally ill yeah I'm gonna take you through from through I'm just going
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:37.880]  to check check you know down the list here but do you believe that there is a
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:43.840]  spirit that inhabits you and it enables you to get guidance from another
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:50.760]  unseen spirit yes God you do who I just put another check mark here so there's
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:54.400]  a whole list of things that are going to be asked of you all of it is to show
[1:28:54.400 --> 1:29:00.120]  that you are in fact incapable and by the way you're not joking in and it's

[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:17.040]  want socialism and it's all about how they control the narrative they decide
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:21.880]  what is they I mean this is part of their psychosis is that they're in charge
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:26.280]  and you need to be institutionalized because you're non-compass meant us
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:29.880]  you're not in charge your fact of your faculties it's obvious you believe in

[1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:23.320]  can feel it when you go to work when you go to church when you pay your tax it is
[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:28.880]  the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth that you
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:34.360]  are a slave like everyone else you were born into bondage born into a prison
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:41.320]  that you cannot smell or taste or touch a prison for your mind
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:51.800]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind by the way and
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:56.840]  health news it's up on info wars.com the video the interview during any age six
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:01.600]  time mr. Olympian one of the most famous bodybuilders in history I guess
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:05.640]  only next to Schwarzenegger even I know that I don't even follow about a bit
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:09.120]  bodybuilding has come out against fluoride and talked about how deadly it
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:12.640]  is in the water supply and that's good because then people like that will get
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:15.680]  to the bodybuilders and then famous soccer players have come out against
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.320]  fluoride and then people wake up there and then a teenage girl in Mississippi
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:25.160]  spends three years exposing a deadly very toxic chemical and Gatorade linked
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:30.360]  all sorts of problems cumulatively and now Gatorade's pulling it out I mean
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:36.160]  there is an example of solutions and the government is going to try to get more
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:39.240]  power and then sometimes you're going to get real tyrants in charge that want to
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:45.920]  go for it all and that's why we need to say no warrantless checkpoints aren't to
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:50.160]  keep us safe it's to set up a police state and now they're saying the warrantless
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:54.400]  checkpoints aren't for al-qaeda now they're for gun owners and everything our
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:57.360]  guest was announcing I had to really bite my tongue and not interrupt a bunch
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:00.640]  about how we're gonna have more ankle bracelets that were found mentally ill
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:06.080]  how they can just announce it now under these new federal edicts they're saying
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:10.280]  and the Soviets and the Nazis did this Hitler the first people they killed had
[1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:15.600]  been grabbed and ordered mentally ill by psychiatrist and and just like in China
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:18.920]  they said all your kids got a clubfoot we're gonna kill your two-year-old they
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:22.000]  would take them into the doctor's office and then say oh they died of a heart
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:26.480]  attack there's actually documentaries on this they killed hundreds of thousands
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:31.160]  before they even started arresting political dissidents and it's eugenics
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:35.360]  it's like why are we seeing the same thing because Hitler didn't get it from
[1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:39.840]  Germany he got it from England and from the United States that developed modern
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:44.600]  eugenics and then he took it to an extreme level and quote discredited it so
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:49.120]  the Journal of eugenics switched over to the Journal of Population and things
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:53.000]  like that and I covered that in our film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.360]  available at infowarstore.com so important to see that so important to
[1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:01.480]  show it to your church now expanding here and then we're going back to our
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:06.560]  guest you know beyond Tangierine and some of the other amazing things that

[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:23.120]  infowars.com from Yahoo Finance and we'll punch this up and post it on top
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:28.160]  of it it's in the health section of infowars.com video pharmacist exposes
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:34.520]  deadly antidepressants but then under that is the Yahoo Finance international
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:38.880]  AL international announces results of young Jevity clinical studies performed
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:47.120]  by Clemson University Yahoo Finance they took cancer cells from human cancer
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:50.280]  in the colon that's just exploding because of all the toxins and chemicals and
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:55.960]  of course it mutates the cells and the the the the young Jevity beyond Tangierine
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:59.320]  they tested some of the others as well you can go read the results in a
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:08.600]  scientific study went in and did not hurt the healthy cells and killed the
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:11.640]  unhealthy cancer cells now the reason they knew when they did this probably
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:15.480]  what was going to happen is Pauline got a Nobel Prize for this folks I don't know
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:18.760]  was it 40 years ago but it got suppressed they're just redoing these

[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:53.120]  it but again most these guys say no I can confirm it you know look at this
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:56.920]  manual look at that manual I keep forgetting we guys type in army field
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:01.880]  manual gun confiscation because I want to give them the dash number and all
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:05.360]  that and I forgot to do it during the break we've written 20 articles or more
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:10.040]  on it but I want to give that out again people want to go look it up but after
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:12.800]  we take these five or six calls that are on the phone board that'll be your
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:18.720]  chance to call in eight hundred two five nine nine two three one for military
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:22.560]  or police are now training with them in gun confiscation you've got all these
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:26.080]  drills that used to happen a few times a year now thousands of times a year
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:32.920]  checkpoints helicopter assaults Houston Miami Chicago all this week I've sent the
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:36.600]  guys two years ago to Chicago where they practice putting citizens in a sports
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:42.160]  stadium with foreign trips and again I've shot video where the Marines trained
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:45.840]  to put Americans in these facilities now it doesn't mean they'll get away with
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:49.400]  it you're not supposed to get scared and run high under a bridge because of this
[1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:55.120]  you're supposed to go hey this isn't morally right no no no if you cower see
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:58.480]  the globalists hope you just get get scared and shut up and go along with
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:02.320]  them I'm looking for men and women who will go no we're gonna stand up against
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:09.160]  this and I want to I want to go back to our guest Dr. Jim Garrow who again is
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:13.040]  one of the largest chains of English-speaking you know teaching schools
[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:19.200]  in China since 2000 save over 45,000 little Chinese baby girls who would
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:22.760]  have been killed after birth which they're now promoting here the big
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:26.640]  bioethics journal last year people didn't believe it when we publish an
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:30.560]  article linked to them saying let's kill kids up to age three even if they're
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:35.480]  healthy that it took three days for mainstream media to pick it up saying
[1:40:35.480 --> 1:40:39.320]  it couldn't be true and they called it was a real study put out in their
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:42.160]  journal we're gonna get to that coming up and we'll keep a little bit in the
[1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:46.000]  next hour if you can do it because again constitutional lawyer Bruce Fine was
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:49.440]  stuck in court he apologized we appreciate him he's on tomorrow talk
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:52.440]  about the constitutional attacks that are going on and how to strike back
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:57.200]  against it but Dr. Jim Garrow is our guest right now what about my point
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:04.280]  because I'm not a tough guy but you know if tyranny's coming down on me I know
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:10.160]  instinctively or in my spirit to to say no and stand up against it now if I can
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:13.960]  get out of the way you know short term you know I sometimes I do try to back
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:18.880]  down but it depends on you know what the gut level decision is and I know
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:21.920]  giving it a tyranny historically intellectually but also my gut tells me
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:25.320]  my gut says you will not back down like it's the opposite it's like I have
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:28.920]  absolutely no fear which is like a z-keel you know saying in the Bible God
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:32.560]  they're gonna kill me but it burns in my bones I can't stop I mean it's the
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:36.200]  opposite of fear it's not courage I don't want to be thank for what I do I
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:40.960]  can't control myself my whole gut my spirit my intellect intellectually it
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.480]  confirms it you stand up to move to intimidate you and set up checkpoints
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:50.040]  and secretly arrest people and in DAA and all this you don't you don't get
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:54.360]  scared but so many people email me and write me and go what you say is true but
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:59.000]  I'm scared I've got ulcers I'm an officer in the army I don't know what to do
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:03.320]  and I don't know about that spirit of fear you know good thank God we know
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:08.360]  thank God people spoken up thank God this has come out thank God what do you
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:12.520]  say to those that don't get this and think oh my gosh what's the point of
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:16.960]  knowing this it's so negative isn't it positive to know so that we can contend
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:22.680]  and wrestle with this evil absolutely you know what I would do with those
[1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:26.560]  people who aren't willing to listen you you're you're not responsible for them
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:31.720]  you're really not you're responsible for your own belief system and then you're
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:35.840]  responsible for your own family so you know very much like planning for anything
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:40.560]  else in life you plan for the survival of yourself and your family that's what
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:43.680]  you've got to do that's what we're looking at we're not we're not just this
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.920]  is in theory now these people are moving they're making moves forward that will
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:52.000]  take away your freedom they take away the guns remember the first thing that the
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.440]  Germans did was declare that Jews were not quite people and then the first
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:59.680]  people to lose the right to own a gun were the Jews and of course that made
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:04.720]  them the easiest to be rounded up but let's be careful here again the caution
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:11.200]  should be think plan figure out your escape route figure out what you will
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:14.440]  do when they come knocking on your door at night do you have somebody to back you
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:18.480]  up if that happens or are you just gonna be a ready victim they'll just march in
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:22.600]  your home and take you and your family confiscate the guns and take you and your
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:27.040]  family away do you have a plan for that that's what you need to do let's start
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:32.160]  planning and I mean there are people out there who who are accused of being you
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:36.960]  know the crazies that didn't foil a hat kind of people but then conspiracy
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:41.280]  theorists well you know conspiring together that's what law is all about
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:46.960]  we make a social contract we conspire together to come up with laws and a way
[1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:50.880]  to handle and control society well this is going beyond that and now they're
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:55.560]  gonna handle and control us now what are you gonna do about it what it is going
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:59.480]  to be your plan for your family I think you need to look to that first and
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:04.840]  foremost responsibility and get it very clear have planned know what you're
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:11.160]  gonna do know what you're gonna do in the long term I agree with you but my
[1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:16.400]  point is they won't get away with this if we simply challenge them and you know
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:19.680]  folks have always said the archetypal image of the crazy guys he's yelling
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:23.960]  well we're yelling to get people out of their coma some people are smooth like
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:28.920]  you other people like myself get upset I also sometimes am calm but I found I've
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:33.000]  been successful not on purpose I didn't do this on purpose by being upset
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:36.600]  sometimes to get people out of their learned helplessness out of their mass
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:43.640]  Stockholm syndrome out of their normalcy bias because I mean things have gotten
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:48.920]  so crazy I want to read this quote but if I say I will not mention him or speak
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:55.040]  any more in his name his word is in my heart like a fire a fire shut up in my
[1:44:55.040 --> 1:45:00.360]  bones I am weary holding an end indeed I cannot because my uncle about 15 years
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:03.800]  ago I'm sitting across the coffee table from he's a big Bible scholar probably
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:08.040]  listening right now my mom's brother great guy Vietnam that helicopter pilot
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:11.800]  Patriot lived all over the world and I said you know I can't help it when they
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:15.400]  death threat me I can't help it when they get my face I I don't understand people
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:20.160]  that are afraid of the New World Order I can't shut up it's a burning and then
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:24.240]  he quoted the scripture to me which I'd never read but I mean I just wish other
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:28.960]  people had the burning in their bones I mean I guess you're saying if someone's
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:33.640]  not called to fight evil I guess that I mean you're saying just triage them no
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:37.680]  no I'm saying look to the first responsibility that you have which is
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:41.960]  to your family make a plan for them but make sure that your plan is thorough
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:46.120]  that you understand they will come when you least expect it they're not going to
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:49.240]  come in broad daylight they'll come at night when you're asleep they'll bang
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:53.080]  it on your door when you're least prepared to react properly that's when
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:57.240]  this is going to start to happen they've already you know done the groundwork
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:02.680]  they've got the evidence on you test last year we're Brandon Robin all these
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:07.360]  Marines honorably discharged officers no criminal record would mildly criticize
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:11.280]  Obama and they would have the police come and mentally commit them it's happened
[1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:14.760]  to a bunch of talk show host already last year yeah and look what they're
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:18.400]  saying they're saying that anyone who's been a veteran has been overseas comes
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:23.320]  back you're you're immediately suspect of being a terrorist or a terrorist threat
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:27.480]  and what's that about you mentioned Hitler first they went after a group
[1:46:27.480 --> 1:46:31.560]  who'd been demonized and unpopular the Jews but it but then they went after
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:34.200]  every group you know the famous quota they went after the Jews I wasn't a
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:36.960]  Jews I didn't stand up they went after the Methodist I wasn't a Methodist I
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:42.240]  didn't stand up I mean by the end of it the Nazis my grandfather became an
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.560]  inventor because in Dallas growing up he lived next door to a famous inventor
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:51.600]  who'd been involved in venting a indoor refrigeration or taking those systems
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:57.000]  indoor air conditioning and so and this guy was a German immigrant since he was
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:00.560]  a little kid but he spoke German and my grandfather you know had a lot of German
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:04.480]  ancestors so he spoke some German Germans that came into Texas so they
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:09.360]  became friends he worked with him some the Germans extorted he told me the
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:14.640]  story when I was a little kid all the money out of that guy before and then
[1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:17.800]  right up to World War two threatening to kill his family and the guy wasn't
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:21.200]  Jewish so I mean that people that say all the Nazis you know didn't really do
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:25.900]  all this stuff baloney and I'm telling you it's the same organized crime system
[1:47:25.900 --> 1:47:31.520]  that we're now seeing unfold I mean this is a great danger oh amen and the fact
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:35.800]  that you've been cautioning people for years to me is like wow you've been
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:39.200]  thinking ahead you know you've been that's the problem though you're so
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:43.680]  far ahead of the curve of the reality of today like like everyone's secure it
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:47.800]  we're snug as a bug in a rug things are working well society is great we got
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.360]  power we got water we got gas in our car we can go on holiday we got money in the
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:57.840]  bank we got a job yeah well wait until all of it is cut off what's your plan
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:02.040]  that's that's what I'm I keep coming back to like we're not talking about what
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:07.840]  what my officer friend cautioned beyond but basically where he went with the
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.120]  whole the whole scenario was what will the public do when they finally pull the
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:17.240]  plug on everything and well that's the deal there they're derating the banks
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:21.480]  they're derating the country they're saying we're gonna go double that the
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:27.680]  the debt to our GDP they're doing it on purpose to make us dependent and what
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:30.480]  will happen when they drop the hammer I guess they're gonna say do what you're
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:33.840]  told or starve to death and I don't people to know when the globalists take
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.400]  down America it's not gonna be creeping anymore they're gearing up for an all-out
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:43.280]  assault and it's great yeah yeah it's great absolutely a lightning war I mean
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:48.320]  it's incredible against us and man I tell you folks don't be afraid speak out
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:52.640]  now I believe it's gonna backfire and they may back off if here's the problem
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:56.880]  they've committed to an economic collapse they may not be able to stop but but I
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:01.040]  see every sign they're trying to just accelerate the collapse while posing as
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:05.120]  the savior Alex you're absolutely right the signs that I'm getting and the word
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:09.320]  that I'm getting back is that when I was told this that last Monday morning
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:14.280]  that since we put it into the public view look at the things that have happened
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:19.640]  bang all the sudden we've got to well you know better what's going on I don't
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:23.480]  know what the list of things that are going on but things are accelerating I
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:28.000]  think what we've helped to do is push them through fear and the purchase of
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.880]  guns in ammo that's the big thing that they weren't counting on they didn't
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:34.440]  count that the American public go in that direction you know what they were
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:37.720]  hoping for was that everyone would just you know everything business as usual
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:42.040]  you know it's only the government doing this doing that Obama you know the
[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:48.000]  kindly the kindly father the great smile that he's not evil he's he's not
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  gonna do anything to us this is all for our good sounds very much like how
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:58.560]  Hitler was viewed as well the night that's coming and I keep saying it's
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.680]  night because actually scripture talks about a night it's not when you're
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:05.920]  ready for it it's at night that they're gonna come and this is all gonna
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:11.720]  happen it's in that night when you will need to be prepared so what are you
[1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:14.560]  doing to protect your own family what are you doing to network your
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:19.920]  neighborhood so that there is a group of people to protect one another because
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:23.600]  remember something it's overwhelming force that they're being taught to use
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:28.920]  overwhelming force what happened at Waco and I bring up Waco as an example
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.520]  because here was overwhelming force and in the end they just brutalized and
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:38.800]  murdered all those women and children and then the military posed with the
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:41.880]  skulls they were very very proud of the work they done when they could have
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:46.400]  arrested Koresh in town who went into town every day and had a business in
[1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:49.280]  town we're gonna come back and take calls can you stay with us 20 minutes the

[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:17.320]  that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a
[1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:20.880]  few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:24.960]  for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe that
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:28.720]  more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and the
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:32.480]  government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:37.840]  free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:42.440]  off the conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right
[1:53:42.440 --> 1:53:47.680]  now to discover exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your

[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:38.760]  population out there inside this giant reeducation camp that has become
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:42.040]  America need to ask themselves do you want to be slaves under this now again
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:45.480]  we got a bunch of calls for our guests they'll be all over the map I guess
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:48.800]  someone we're holding before he got on with us but then as each person hangs
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:54.560]  up we're only taking calls in the next hour of military and police I mean again
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:57.720]  in fact we put the Army manual back up on screen if you haven't taken it down
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:01.760]  I'm gonna give people the 2010 Army manual internment and resettlement

[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:15.120]  three dash three nine dot 40 internment resettlement operations so there's more
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:19.120]  proof of what our guest is saying for the Army Times admits it brigade
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:26.400]  homeland the big police chief summit that they had giant Napolitano at said
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:33.720]  the new threat is an al-Qaeda just just this week but Monday the new threat is
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:37.280]  returning veterans gun owners conservatives and libertarians we are
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.200]  violent radical extremists because we know that globalists have taken the
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:47.080]  country over and again our guest is dr. Jim Garrow let's go to Diane then we'll
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:52.320]  go to Jeannie and others Diane you want about martial law go ahead well I got a
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:56.560]  couple things first of all I think I'm in good company I guess I'm mentally ill
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:56:00.400]  because I believe there's an evil plan but I'm not going to get in fear it's
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:04.200]  going to be scary but I've read the book and I know how it is it's going to be
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:08.920]  good I was wondering if you could confirm on one of these sites you've had on
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:14.600]  before it's news.com that there was evidently a truck pulled over that they
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:19.000]  found the martial law signs in the truck in Houston and then I've been reading
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.360]  more and more articles I'm trying to keep moving for you I've been reading more
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.960]  and more articles about martial law just being inflicted in the home where
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:30.520]  when we finally run out of food and supplies will come out and submit and
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:33.920]  I was wondering what you thought about that I have an uncle that's retired from
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:38.920]  the Air Force who thinks we're total crackpots that there will not even be a
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:42.480]  problem with the economy or anything against her guns for 10 or 20 more
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:47.520]  years and he just retired in the last six years and yeah I noticed people that
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:51.560]  are delusional think it's all going to happen after they die it's always and
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:55.800]  see it's the old-timers that held all this back and see that's the paradox
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:57:01.560]  patriots hold it back but still we're sliding so we slowed it down and then
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:05.120]  as everything starts to happen like we said oh well it's supposed to be worse
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:09.800]  than this as we battle to win the war against these people I mean it's such a
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:14.520]  mind game that's been played but no unfortunately that martial law sign
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:18.400]  thing I've been hearing for 17 years it's a proverbial deal they're not going
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:21.400]  to call it martial law it's gonna be called civil emergency and they're
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:25.280]  already look it's martial law when the TSA sticks their hands down your pants
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:28.960]  it's martial law when the police have checkpoints in your town it's martial
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:34.000]  law when the TSA is down Lamar right now running checkpoint searching people
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:37.720]  without warrants in Austin where I live it's martial law when the military does
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:41.440]  drill in cities every day I want to go back to our guests thank you for the
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:45.800]  call ma'am yeah you know what about her point about martial law we're always
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:50.080]  looking for martial law martial law if there is a big martial law it's what
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:53.320]  about false flags I asked that question earlier you never got to it what about
[1:57:53.320 --> 1:57:58.440]  Obama staging things well you know and by the way I didn't hear any of the the
[1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:06.160]  collars words at all I'm sorry I was so but in terms of what he does let's face
[1:58:06.160 --> 1:58:10.640]  it I think I said this before he's an incrementalist that's what he does it's
[1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:15.600]  by small increments that he sees what he can get away with and continues to go
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:20.000]  further and further and further at every turn so in terms of martial law
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:25.040]  remember he's looking for a crisis and then he will as they said he we will
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:29.440]  manage the crisis so the management of that crisis may be that you lose your
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:34.080]  freedoms totally right now tell us stay there back in 60 seconds I want to hear

[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:17.240]  done it before but wasn't being guys he also something it was stage basically it
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:21.280]  was meant to be a kidnapping a supposed a quasi pseudo kidnapping of the
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:25.960]  ambassador and then he would work it through the details so that in the end
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:31.900]  you had the blind chic being released so that the dear leader could once again
[2:01:31.900 --> 2:01:39.000]  look heroic to the Muslim population and instead he got killed instead the whole
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:45.080]  thing and you know what two gentlemen stood up and put their lives on the line

[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:04.240]  denied why did they want them dead and you know this is all this is all
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:08.520]  information it's available that we know that they had the gunship we we know
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:13.200]  that they had the drones there we know that they had the laser targeting and
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:17.240]  on these people were left whatever happened out you know don't leave any

[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:43.040]  I'm currently using to spread the word and actually I got the information an
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:48.000]  idea from you I think you had said once that we need to like go out on the
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:53.240]  street corners with a sign that says you know 9-11 was an inside job or whatever
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:59.480]  you know whatever you wanted to put on it and I actually have 16 signs that line
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:04.360]  my front yard almost like the old political signs from the useless people
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:08.960]  that are running for city councils and stuff I actually have 16 signs that have
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:15.720]  different various things from 9-11 to vaccines I have a six-year-old grandson
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:21.320]  that's got brain damage from vaccines when he was 18 months so I advocate for

[2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:13.320]  lines of the info war
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:27.960]  ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna do a special report on this this week I've
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:33.040]  talked a lot about it over the years and shown the news articles but it's close
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:41.760]  to 59,000 when I checked last week people have died since 2007 in Mexico it's
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:46.040]  approaching 60,000 and they believe there's tens of thousands they don't
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:51.200]  know about that have been buried there's some estimates over 50,000 missing so
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:57.760]  that could be 109,000 but more people die every year in Mexico than died in the
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:03.000]  decade of the Vietnam War 58,000 Americans died roughly over that decade
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:10.040]  long plus conflict we're talking about 59,000 since 2007 so five and a half six
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:15.760]  years and we need to get that number out because all guns have been taken in
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:21.240]  Mexico from the people and the reason I raised that is at least three shot at
[2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:26.320]  office complex in Phoenix, Arizona this is just breaking the last 15 minutes or
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:33.160]  so and an employee at a law office in the area told newspapers he had seen four
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:36.920]  people take him in on stretchers that's we also got helicopter shots of that
[2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:40.280]  television footage shows dozens of officers entering a building where
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:44.840]  police say people are injured and again it's either gangs it's somebody going
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:50.640]  postal or it is a Prozac head it's always the same at home the answer is
[2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:53.920]  have guns in there because there's a bad person with the guns gonna kill you just
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:58.760]  like Mexico they got the highest crime rate in the world they don't have the
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:02.320]  highest city though Mexico City is at number one Chicago is by the way the
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:06.400]  Chicago police chief I've got that in the stack he's saying don't worry you know
[2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:11.000]  we've got a 530 something killed last year we've taken all your guns highest
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.440]  crime rate for any city in the world it's not that bad that's the quote the
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:17.680]  Associated Press fact I have even a video clip of him I was seeing this
[2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:21.640]  morning it's not that bad though he's in press conferences wanting you to turn
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:25.960]  your guns in or he's taken the guns the murders aren't that bad oh but it's
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:31.440]  Sandy Hook terrible that this guy got guns illegally and and now you got to
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:35.120]  turn your guns in but when people get killed in his gun-free zone it's a no
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:40.280]  big deal so numerous emergency vehicles are at the scene video footage showing
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:44.160]  a person being taken on the gurney reached the scene and it's gotten the
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:48.080]  point with more kids built a Lego it looked like a gun with a Lego so the
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:52.600]  SWAT team was called that happened today it's this total hysteria people drive
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.560]  by and see a kid with a Nerf gun bright orange helicopters police foaming at the
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:01.080]  mouth hyperventilating bubble projectors now the police are being called
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:05.280]  and there's nothing more deadly than a pink hello kitty bubble gun I want to go
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:09.480]  back to our guest Jim Garo and he want to talk about some solutions and standing
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:14.440]  up he's somebody that knows how to stand up and we're gonna go to James in
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:19.360]  Colorado who's a Marine who can comment on has he been told you know are you
[2:11:19.360 --> 2:11:23.200]  ready to fire on American citizens and the lines are open just for military
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:26.200]  people now we've got some others that are holding from before I'll get to you as
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:31.200]  well but eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one our guest of course
[2:11:31.200 --> 2:11:35.560]  let's talk to a quote living military legend who says he's talked to other
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:39.640]  officers who are being told now as a litmus test will you fire on citizens
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:42.920]  well I have the Army manual where they're now training for gun confiscation
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:48.320]  and shooting us and the drills are waves of protesters being mowed down by full
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:53.760]  auto homeland security spot 1.6 billion bullets the last 14 months as you know
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:57.480]  and now a new purchase order for homeland security quote personal protection
[2:11:57.480 --> 2:12:01.040]  weapons we had that up at info wars comm yesterday from the federal
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:08.120]  registry for 7,000 fully auto 308s for personal protection just just you know
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:12.680]  that every week there's more purchases so they're gearing up for world war three
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:17.840]  against us but make your point about solutions standing up in your words then
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:22.360]  we'll go to that Marine well let's face it in your in your local community that's
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:26.560]  where you have your biggest sphere of influence generally that's just a normal
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:30.880]  joke like you and I in our in our little neighborhood so what you do is you run
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:36.880]  for office you run for dog catcher you run for police chief you run for whatever
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:41.920]  I want to give an illustration of the use of the linsky tax tactics I ran for
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:47.640]  school board in my local town I got on there I started you know putting the
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:50.480]  boots to the the people who were just rubber stamping whatever the
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:54.640]  administration wanted in the school district and it meant spending money
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:13:00.880]  like like a drunken sailor so what they did is utilize the media media fully
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:05.480]  socialist Marxist up here in Canada where I am at the moment and I was back
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:10.960]  then and so they use that a linsky method they freeze you they demonize you and
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:15.880]  they cause it that no one will listen to you because the media of course tells
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:20.240]  the tale and controls the message and that's what they will do you must have a
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:25.360]  vehicle some way of getting your message out if you're gonna run for anything so
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:29.760]  that the truth is always available to the public the public you serve but make
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:33.640]  sure that you have that vehicle if you don't have it you're dead because the
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:38.240]  media will cripple you they will freeze you they will demonize you they'll put
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:42.920]  you out of business so no one listens to you but now governor Cuomo who wants
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:48.600]  basically ban all our guns a total gangster his his brother is now the
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:53.680]  morning CNN anchor but CNN's top show has half a million their average show about
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:58.680]  90,000 they are an illusion they are imploding in vectors news today when I
[2:13:58.680 --> 2:14:03.840]  was there and I've been to their studios three times it looked like a third
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:08.600]  world facility I don't want to describe it but I mean the bathrooms because
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:11.800]  after I saw one I said they put me in this on purpose I went and checked a
[2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:17.240]  few more the carpet light bulbs out dirt on the floors in the studios horrible
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:20.640]  morale I mean these guys are falling apart but here it is
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:26.640]  cloward-piven strategy and of course that's the 1966 sociologist that I
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:30.840]  first told people about 15 years ago that books have been now written about by
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.840]  others my greatest success is even though you know I'm not Rush Limbaugh and
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:40.440]  Glenn Beck they just I make stuff popular and they pick it up which I
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:46.320]  think is great you know I force it out there but it was a plan to bankrupt New
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:50.640]  York City and other cities to make you accept socialism the plan is to get you
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:55.680]  dependent and this is published and officially used by the Democratic Party
[2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:58.400]  that's why they're going to shut off your power plants they're going to raise
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:02.920]  taxes on working poor until you give up and go on welfare they want to run your
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:07.520]  life let's go to some Marines here we've got James in Colorado we'll go to him in
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:13.640]  a moment but first JC in Montana Marine with news on general so we'll see what
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:17.960]  that's about and then we've got Army National Guard Matt in Florida again you
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:22.640]  just joined us our source a top general retired told him that they're doing a
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:26.880]  litmus test now will you fire on US citizens and if not you're ordered to
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:30.360]  resign your commission I have all the background proving that's already
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:34.120]  happening I found that in the news and in Army manuals the last three years it's
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:40.360]  changed but what's unprecedented is totally unprecedented is the the new
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:47.280]  sec def nominee Hagel came out and said you cannot trust the military they're
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:51.360]  not on your side Obama you've got to have a purge of them if you want your new
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:55.960]  world order that was Washington Post yesterday okay we wrote an article about
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:02.480]  it at info wars calm I mean this is going on and it's a big deal so let's go
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:11.400]  to JC JC well what can you tell us Jim how's it going all right first of all
[2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:20.720]  general Mattis Matt dog Mattis from Centcom was fired and I'll read you what
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:26.400]  the blaze put on it's like United States Marine Corps general James Matt dog
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:32.160]  Mattis was notified he was being replaced as commander central command not by a
[2:16:32.160 --> 2:16:37.440]  phone call from Washington but by a note by his aid according to foreign
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:42.320]  policies Thomas E. Rick's general Mattis was traveling in a meeting when an aide
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:45.960]  passed him a note telling him that the Pentagon had announced his replacement
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:50.400]  as head of central command and I saw that a while back four generals in the
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:54.920]  last month have been relieved and the Centcom folks are angry because they
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:59.880]  beg the White House in the eight hour Benghazi operation to let them bomb the
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:06.440]  targets and were ordered to stand down that's come out Centcom general Mattis
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:12.320]  is loved he's a good man he's a he's a Marine I mean I'm a Marine I mean
[2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:20.040]  everyone loves this guy I mean I don't know if Jim's force was referencing Jim
[2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:23.880]  he's probably referencing someone younger the way he talks that it was
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:28.960]  mentored by the general that he knows but when Mattis is out of central command
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:35.760]  something's wrong I mean there's no reason I mean and some of the some of
[2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:42.960]  the stuff I read was um general Mattis said he doesn't have the balls to come
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:46.800]  down here and tell me himself I mean this is kind of man he is well you don't
[2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:52.960]  get a name like Matt dog for being diplomatic but I mean this was a man
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:59.200]  that protected America loved America and well that's probably the reason he's not
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:05.400]  in Centcom no more but uh well no there is a look look the military purge is
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:10.080]  already confirmed but but the but the the new secretary of defense they're
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:14.880]  trying to confirm that the nominee says you can't trust the military and they're
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:18.840]  purging them all around us I appreciate your call God bless you this just
[2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:23.560]  backs up everything Jim Garrow dr. Garrow saying from the MO and I looked it
[2:18:23.560 --> 2:18:27.040]  up and I know these guys running the same circles I believe it's general
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:30.080]  Boykin the former head of special forces because he's already speaking out
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:33.480]  already know people that know him well he's anti-new world order he's in the
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:38.680]  film that we sell the whole appell horse with Charlie Daniels he's speaking out
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:43.840]  right now about tyranny I believe it's a general Boykin but yeah what about the
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:47.400]  general purge of the military and the new secretary of defense is a top
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:51.840]  globalist haggle a fake republican a fake conservative saying that you know
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:57.640]  the Obama can't trust the military well to do that it wasn't admission here are
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:01.600]  the people that are ready to lay their life on the line I mean think about this
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:06.200]  that the difference here you got the military ready to lay their lives on the
[2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:10.000]  line you got the politicians what are they ready to lay they're ready to go
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:14.120]  out and have a great wine and cheese at your expense and supposedly your
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:17.600]  purport to be representing you and they're the ones that are afraid of the
[2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:21.640]  military well they should be afraid of merit military because they have not
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:26.480]  lost their sense of priority politicians have lost the priority and Leon
[2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:30.680]  Panetta member last year he wouldn't go to any bases with any of the even the
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:37.240]  officers armed remember that yeah could it be that they really would rather not
[2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:43.040]  see him well I mean that's why they want to go to robots and drones because
[2:19:43.040 --> 2:19:48.520]  despots have always hated having to have real men do the killing form and so
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:51.560]  they despise them that's why as soon as they're out of the military they're the
[2:19:51.560 --> 2:19:55.080]  number one enemy of homeland security you heard me again this is public this is
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:59.200]  admitted our government says the military is the terrorist I mean wake up

[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:17.360]  than four the last few months it's been four James Mattis he said in order to
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:21.640]  kill the enemy you have to kill an innocent don't take the shot don't
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:26.280]  create more enemies then you can take out by some immoral act see that's what
[2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:31.080]  they don't like though they want people who think it's tough to just you know
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:34.640]  put al-Qaeda in charge and then later go in and fight al-Qaeda after you give him
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:38.240]  control of Syria and a lot of the generals have been saying we should not be
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:41.720]  giving missiles to al-Qaeda we should not I mean obviously you shouldn't be
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:45.280]  doing this and the system doesn't care they're going full speed ahead they
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:50.760]  think the public is so dumb our government sent com had to put al-Qaeda
[2:24:50.760 --> 2:24:56.160]  in charge of Libya now in Syria and that's why they've removed it's three
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:01.120]  top officers out of simcom alone so when I say four total it's way more than
[2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:04.200]  that I mean they're there they're kicking people out everywhere there is a
[2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:09.760]  purge there is a purge of the military because they don't want to be used
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:15.200]  domestically and they don't want to work with al-Qaeda and we're forcing that
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:20.120]  public debate and that's a good thing let's talk with our guest who's going
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:24.080]  to ride shotgun with us for the rest of the hour let's go ahead and talk to
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:30.080]  Kevin them a Marine in Texas and then we'll go to James is a Marine in
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:35.000]  Colorado a National Guard folks Matt and Bob who was in the Rob who was in the
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.840]  Coast Guard with an internal survey on gun confiscation we know they've been
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:42.880]  creeping around with that for a while but let's go to Kevin Kevin you're on the
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:47.120]  air go ahead and give us your point hey thanks I'm just going with what you're
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:52.320]  saying about that whole purge of the military well the Marine Force Reserve
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:57.400]  is actually doing a fizz-rig where every unit's getting realigned and with
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:02.800]  different MLS which is going to actually bring up you can have thousands and
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:07.680]  thousands upon Marines being dropped dropped out two thousand military you
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:12.480]  got to make places for the new women to fight in the front lines well right but
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:17.920]  like at my unit we don't work we're a combat arms unit but we were not like
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:24.520]  infantry were tracks and stuff 98% of my unit is going to be dropped and that's
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:29.680]  going on across across the nation you're gonna have all these Marines being
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:33.000]  dropped dropped out the military and then to go along with what you were
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:37.800]  saying you know about how the military is on your side blah blah blah this is
[2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:42.600]  gonna I guess the way I'm the way I'm thinking is it's gonna actually have a
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:47.280]  effect on you know how you say did you hear El Sharpton basically say we don't
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:51.160]  need the military anymore we have drones and then if Americans cause problems
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:55.960]  they've got drones we played the clip yesterday let's cue that up in the next
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:59.360]  segment I want to play that for people I mean that's every time I'm on the young

[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:13.840]  GCN radio network
[2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:22.840]  we got a shooting in Arizona up to four injured and now I'm seeing footage on
[2:33:22.840 --> 2:33:27.600]  Fox we'll put it back up your TV viewer of guys that look like they're in army
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:31.080]  outfits look like they are army so they don't look like they're doing too good
[2:33:31.080 --> 2:33:34.440]  with all that gear so those must be police you can tell they hadn't been
[2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:38.880]  carrying they can't carry gear a hundred yards much less 50 miles punch that
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:45.240]  back up that is amazing and and and and they're saying that that they think a
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:49.320]  man with a gun did something to the driver and grabbed a kid off the bus I
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:55.680]  mean this is just getting bizarre folks and if they keep hiding you know all
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:33:58.920]  this brainwashing out there Alabama police and hostage standoff with
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:06.160]  suspect in fatal school bus shooting kidnapping and I mean who knows if that
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:11.600]  was somebody's dad who wanted his kid back or something who knows this country
[2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:17.480]  the Alabama man police they shot and killed a school bus driver to that was
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:20.640]  Tuesday so I guess they're going back to it we just saw that breaking and I
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:23.560]  thought not a new thing and now I guess they've tracked him down and they're
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:28.800]  going after him but again there's 315 million people our crime rate violent
[2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:39.200]  crime rates down 49% since 1991 you can pull those statistics up at FBI.gov
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:44.880]  21% of that just since 2007 so it's accelerating but the media can take the
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:50.960]  events of 300 300 listening moments ago I guess they've tracked him down where
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:53.680]  he's at and that's what's happening so the school bus thing happening
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:56.880]  yesterday now they've tracked down where they believe he's at that's why they're
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:00.840]  it's it's it's new breaking news that this happened just as we were going
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:05.600]  back live here on the radio again right he was our guest the last hour he's
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:11.240]  riding shotgun when we take your calls in this hour and he's Dr. Jim Garrow he
[2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:17.440]  heads up a www.pinkpagodagirls.com that's a group that saved us since
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:21.400]  2000 45,000 plus Chinese newborn babies that would have been
[2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:27.640]  infanticided killed which the major journals bioethics journals are now
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:31.880]  basically saying is a great thing to do here in the United States just absolutely
[2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:35.520]  hellish they say kill the old people kill the babies nobody needs them you'll
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:39.640]  get more tax money if we kill people once they communalize and get things
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:43.440]  collectivized then they can tell you how to live your life it's it's and then
[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:47.960]  people dying as Bill Gates says you kill grandma that's a death panel that's a
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:52.600]  quote then you hire 10 teachers and the teachers clap that's the sick
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:56.600]  collectivist model instead of grow the pie and then you become North Korea and
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:36:02.280]  everything collapses but they love it but going back to the caller who was a
[2:36:02.280 --> 2:36:07.640]  Marine I think in Colorado did he hang up as he said he was a Marine but I
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:12.640]  couldn't really understand yeah he dropped off he was talking about I
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:16.040]  couldn't really tell what he was getting into and then I said I'd come back to
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:20.360]  him but I guess he didn't understand that let's talk to Matt in Florida Army
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:26.680]  National Guard Matt in Florida wants to comment again we know the Army manuals
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:31.040]  who just joined us in the last three years now strain for gun confiscation
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:34.640]  and we know the military is being prepared for domestic operations that's
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:38.120]  admitted they're saying the new enemy is not al-Qaeda it's conservatives
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:43.760]  libertarians gun owners but now we've seen that the incoming if he gets
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:48.400]  confirmed Secretary of Defense former Senator Hagel saying the military can't
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:52.720]  be trusted you know that that Obama if he wants his new world order has to deal
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:36:57.080]  with the Pentagon that they're not following orders we know what the
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:02.080]  orders are give al-Qaeda missiles set up checkpoints on highways the military
[2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:06.120]  has been saying no so there's a huge purge going right now if you're a new
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:09.320]  listener folks it's mainstream news the government gives al-Qaeda weapons now
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:13.840]  publicly well why not they can take our liberties when they attack I mean I mean
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:18.640]  this all is so diabolical but let's go to their caller here Matt in Florida
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:24.000]  you're on the air go ahead yes I've been commissioned for you know almost 11
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:29.280]  years now I've been in the guard double time and I will by my upfront I will
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:33.960]  never confiscate anybody's guns I'll fight that order I will never shoot on my
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:38.840]  fellow citizens I'll fight that's why they got the guys in Katrina from another
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:42.240]  state because they knew their guys in their own state their own neighborhood
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:46.280]  wanting to confiscate their fellow neighbors guns see that's ridiculous if
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:50.720]  I'm from Texas I wouldn't take New Yorkers guns I mean how is it different
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:55.400]  from a different state well they just it's just it's it's in mental I think I
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:57.920]  mean if you're sitting there right in your own city and that's why they
[2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:01.400]  originally got these guys that's why a lot of them now come back and said well
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:05.160]  that's ridiculous why did I do that you know they a lot of more brainwash a lot
[2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:07.760]  of the young guys that just didn't know any better by the way that's what the
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:11.200]  Soviets did and at Tiananmen Square the same thing that's why they had to wait
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:15.200]  eight hours they brought troops in from 300 miles away from another province
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:19.840]  that spoke a different type of Chinese yeah and so my concern right now is this
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:23.280]  whole dual status commander thing and I know you try to talk about before but
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:28.520]  where a general in the in the National Guard can command troops from back to
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:32.000]  duty so they can come down as long as the governor says yeah it's good they'll
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:35.280]  come in and they'll be able to basically be on the street with our soldiers at
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:38.800]  the shoulder to shoulder with our National Guard troops and that's you know and
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:43.520]  then the round on policy commentators then it's ridiculous I mean it's it's
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:47.200]  just another way of them creating in that active duty component mate you know
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:50.160]  they don't know the rules and regulations of the National Guard what do you make of
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:54.520]  the new Army manuals that were trained for gun confiscation and lockdown of US
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:58.440]  cities it's ridiculous and I've showed that to some guys and they're like holy
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:02.760]  cow the guys in my unit they're like this is read this is unbelievable where's
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:05.920]  this you know and so that the reason I'm staying in and I've
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:09.280]  last few years my wife has always asked me why are you staying in you know you
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:12.760]  have the you know thing that you say about a military well it's like I stay
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:16.800]  in because I want to warn people I want to wake people up that's why that's my
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:21.840]  beautiful I'm it and then I have every time I go to drill on my weekend every
[2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:25.480]  month I talk to them about what's going on I wake the wake people up all the
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:29.600]  time that's why they want to have the litmus test purge is to get the good
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:34.360]  people out and again the military itself is individuals it's who's in command of
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:37.360]  it people say well you're anti-military you don't want checkpoints on the
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:42.720]  highway no I'm pro-constitution it's like saying I'm anti-ford truck I'm an
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:46.000]  anti-ford truck I don't want a crazy person running me over with a Ford
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:50.920]  truck it's just like I'm not anti-gun I'm anti bad people with guns but bad
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:55.600]  people always have guns so I'm gonna have my gun don't blame me for what
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:40:00.120]  somebody else does beautiful comments I want to bring up Dr. Garrow to bring up
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:04.360]  any points he's got well you know the whole psychological breakdown here of
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:09.760]  loyalties because of familiarity and that's a classic as a classic move to
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:15.880]  break down not only the the loyalty one to another for example you know that the
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:19.880]  guy you've worked with and trained with is gonna look after you and and have
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:24.280]  your back in a combat situation and you know that you're gonna be loyal or they
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:27.960]  know that you're gonna be loyal to the guy who trained you the officer above
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:34.360]  you or overall let's say the general who has shown themselves to be honorable
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:39.400]  and and very loyal to their men and been a real leader I mean that's that's real
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:42.720]  loyalty well they want to break that down they want to break it down because if
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:48.080]  if they can break the familiarity pattern yes one another and knowing what
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:51.600]  the expectation is they can bring in somebody new and guess what you'll do
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:55.560]  what they say why you don't know any better but but then that actually destroys
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.480]  the military but they don't care the heart of military is the honor and
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:02.560]  taking care of each other because they don't care they want you to act like
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:06.240]  robots because they want robots that'll follow their orders that's why they're
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:11.600]  going to robots no man left behind haven't we just seen a huge demonstration
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:15.320]  of the fact that that no longer exists with the commander-in-chief well it
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:18.560]  wasn't just left behind a lot of evidence shows they were he wanted
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:21.880]  actually that ambassador killed because he wasn't playing ball they were
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:26.680]  transferring missiles to al-qaeda we know they stood down for eight hours with
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:30.160]  troops right down the street at a substation base and ordered to stand
[2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:34.940]  down and only two Navy SEALs refused to not follow orders and went down and
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:41.840]  held off 500 guys for eight hours I mean this is just in credible it is this is
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:46.640]  the bring up some good good news Alex yes or go ahead let me bring up some
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:50.480]  good news I got a little thing and this is I'm calling this the most that roared
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:55.880]  remember that silly movie with Peter Sellers the most that roared yes the
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:42:00.720]  little it principality of Fezwick or something like that gets an atomic bomb
[2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:04.760]  and and they caused the United States to surrender remember that yes it was the
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:08.160]  most that the most that roared but let me tell you about a little most that roared
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:13.160]  incident that's happening right now there's a lawsuit it's against unlawful
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:19.200]  tyranny filed against mr. Obama the United States government for acting like
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:26.240]  a king and it's here it's been filed as a lawsuit it's the citizen who was who's
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:32.520]  a popper has no money approached the court made his case in fact the judge
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:37.040]  wanted to throw it out but for the wrong reason and so he's come back refiled
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:42.020]  and having he's having her removed because she's an Obama appointee who was
[2:42:42.020 --> 2:42:46.280]  obviously trying to protect Obama because this is kind of interesting it's
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:52.640]  about the natural law and having an unnatural born citizen by the way
[2:42:52.640 --> 2:42:58.040]  Obama has two courts have slapped him down for doing unconstitutional things
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:03.880]  on recess appointments and other areas a caller Matt in Florida a National Guard
[2:43:03.880 --> 2:43:08.600]  officer anything else you'd like to add yeah the other thing is guys that are in
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:12.520]  the army war college and you know you know they're at the National Guard and
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:16.520]  they're basically being talked about this whole dual status commander thing
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:20.440]  and almost all the guys and luckily the guy that I know has been there that I
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:24.120]  talked to him was against the dual status commander they were actually trying to
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:28.440]  do regional dual status commanders but they'd have a as I have a commander that
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:32.920]  would be in charge of several states and what they're doing is they created the
[2:43:32.920 --> 2:43:37.640]  team yeah they've created the 10 regions with the governor saying you don't need
[2:43:37.640 --> 2:43:42.400]  50 so oh we have governors the governors we appointed yeah they're they're
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:46.600]  trying to totally get rid of any state control of the National Guard when it's
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:50.040]  always been state go ahead that's what I said I'd like you know so that that
[2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:54.120]  basically goes against all state poverty law I mean that's just basically you
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:57.240]  said the law that and get on that governor and I guess they would all have
[2:43:57.240 --> 2:44:00.920]  to be in on it but still it's just like you know the state poverty doesn't
[2:44:00.920 --> 2:44:04.080]  exist anymore at that point I mean the final thing was I know you talked about
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:08.560]  this before as well but that that our guard guard experience magazine that came
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:12.400]  out that comes out and I get it and I got it because in the middle of year last
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:17.280]  year and you had on the front cover that ran at home and had a guy with spaces
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:21.480]  blacked out and he's a military uniform full battle here and it's like to set it
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:26.000]  home talking about how are we turning veterans and he's on a guard national
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:31.200]  guard magazine and like this is I mean I don't know if you're trying to every
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:35.440]  angle they're trying to you know go this at us and it's like it's completely
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:39.680]  ridiculous when they send our guys over three four five six times hopped up on
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:43.240]  the painkillers and depression medicine and they and they come back and they
[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:47.280]  wonder why they're they're upset or angry or they come back and you know life is
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:51.120]  totally flipped upside down and they wonder why do you guys are you know a
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:56.360]  little off you know it's completely absolutely God bless you and I
[2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:59.080]  appreciate your call we're gonna go to more military calls but first get another
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:02.800]  comment from Dr. Jim Garrow who's on with us right now but if we punch this
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:10.440]  up for TV viewers you can see at info wars.com June 1st 2012 we were mailed a
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:15.520]  copy of this the actual magazine this is what the National Guard is all mailed
[2:45:15.520 --> 2:45:20.240]  National Guard magazine cover story specifies Americans as greatest terror
[2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:25.440]  threat well it actually says veterans imagine they're telling you you're the
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:29.600]  terrorist now go fight yourself and let's continue the latest edition of the
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:33.120]  guards experience the National Guard's official magazine features a cover
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:39.520]  story titled the threat at home and it is a guy in a National Guard uniform with
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:43.960]  explosives tucked in who and what are the biggest dangers to homeland security
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:47.760]  now if you're a foreign mega bank that took over America you're getting ready
[2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:52.000]  to fully gut it you're gonna say the veterans who were patriots and willing
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.560]  to fight they're the enemy I mean imagine if it out of a Simpsons episode with
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:01.440]  the spaceship lands what's the name of the Simpsons Town
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:06.560]  Springfield it's one of the few episodes I've seen and and and the
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:11.520]  spaceship lands and Ugg and Gug these big 14-foot green aliens though we are
[2:46:11.520 --> 2:46:16.160]  your rulers and the mayor and the Rockefeller guy comes up and says yes
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:20.120]  you're right we bow to you which is exactly how it would work this would be
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:23.880]  like a giant flying saucer landing announcing we'll destroy your planet
[2:46:23.880 --> 2:46:27.960]  from orbit if you don't bow to us and by the way the new enemy is anyone that
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:33.520]  says that the planet boobled bapper or whatever is it in control and you know
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:37.360]  now here's your new guard magazine anyone that says aliens don't have a
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:40.280]  right to rule you as the enemy I mean you know founding fathers are bad
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:45.320]  George Washington's bad bill of rights is bad private property bad a mouse a
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:49.440]  tongue good tyranny good I mean this is what they teach at the colleges and now
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:53.400]  they're saying Alex Jones when they say in articles I'm a terrorist I'm a
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:57.320]  radical I'm gonna kill people CNN has said they need to kill me because I'm
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:00.240]  gonna kill them and they wouldn't want to be in a room with me because I might
[2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:05.760]  kill them I have no criminal record I mean these are mad dog tyrants and you
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:08.320]  know since the guy mentions that see when I'm listening to a guest or a caller
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:12.680]  I know if they're for real because I'm immersed in this stuff okay I'm not
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:17.200]  bragging I mean I live this I dream this so they're saying things I know if
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:20.360]  they're true or not truth is already know almost all this stuff I just have
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:23.800]  folks on to give their views on it and different perspectives I'm here to get
[2:47:23.800 --> 2:47:27.360]  you to be aware of it but the callers like it's so ridiculous they're
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:31.800]  teaching us the military or the number one terrorist in our own magazine that's
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:35.600]  because they're a foreign power I'm sorry go ahead yeah Alex they're stealing the
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:40.400]  language that aren't they like think about that you've got a vet you've got a
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:44.640]  man who's given service to the country and he's the terrorist okay now the
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:49.120]  public's looking at terrorists that we're redefining redefining the language
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:56.000]  are we not yes I mean it's incredible okay can it do we have some time to talk
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:59.480]  just for a second about about something that goes way back to this whole notion
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:04.280]  of redefining things and stealing the language absolutely can we do that no
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:10.040]  let me go yes yes go give it to us let me let me go way back way back let's go
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:14.960]  into the Bible for a second do you remember do you remember when all of the
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:17.960]  disciples first came together do you remember it says something about and they
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:24.680]  had they held everything in common they held everything in common it meant the
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:28.520]  rich people brought in the goods and services that they had and the dollars
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:32.400]  that they had because God had blessed them with it what was the notion they
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:36.480]  were gonna share it they were gonna have it in common not a redistribution of
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:40.720]  wealth it's a big difference here there's a huge difference between the
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:43.520]  sociological kind of thing the Marxist kind of thing that they're talking about
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:49.160]  Obama and crew so they held everything in common later on we have the English
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:53.760]  or the British common law what's it come out of it comes out of the scriptures
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:49:00.760]  what has Obama done he has taken communism communism and turned it into
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:06.960]  communism two different things one gives glory to God for the bounty for the
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:11.400]  blessings that he has given and the responsibility do you have one to another
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:18.120]  as Christians or citizens one to another you hold things in common that's why
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:23.320]  if you notice Boston common it wasn't that that piece of land that everyone
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:28.440]  has in common and that used to be the principal part in the downtown of all
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:32.520]  the little villages that were around the little towns there were commons they
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:36.960]  were areas where there it was held in common it wasn't privately owned it was
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:41.360]  publicly owned it was held in common for the good of the common man the common
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:45.840]  man so what Obama and crew are doing and they're teaching this in universities
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:50.520]  is stealing the language so you think that because you give something away to
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:55.880]  someone that that's being a good social it's giving to those who have need
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:01.080]  because you have well that's not what it is the original Christian message was
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:06.080]  that we pulled all things in common from the bounty of God who gave it to us so
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:10.760]  we share that bounty of God as a responsibility not as a social nightmare
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:16.680]  defined by Marxism so I'm just bringing that up for for a short message there
[2:50:16.680 --> 2:50:20.640]  no you're absolutely right and right now on screen for TV viewers I'm showing the
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:25.400]  PDF of the National Guard magazine and it says the number one thread in here is
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:30.800]  gun owners veterans and things like that next to Al Qaeda it puts malicious next
[2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:37.040]  to Al Qaeda next to counterfeiting next to loan groups and says it's the
[2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:43.400]  military's job now to operate domestically and it's in search of the hidden
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:47.480]  enemy look everywhere but Washington with the globalists that have taken over
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:55.840]  trust no one but the government again that is the message they hammer home more
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:00.920]  calls from military Jason a Marine Rob and others National Guard straight ahead
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:04.880]  if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but we're

[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:08.480]  people out of their coma take a few final calls for dr. Jim Garo who's been
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:12.240]  helping blow the whistle on Obama trying to get the military to fire on
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:15.560]  citizens it's good news though that a Hagel came out and said he's got to get
[2:55:15.560 --> 2:55:18.560]  rid of the entire military leadership that the Pentagon isn't under the
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:22.640]  president's command as the president came to Congress and told them he's
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:28.080]  under NATO and you in command the president is by that action guilty of
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:33.960]  tyrannical treasonous activity I mean that is what it is I mean this stuff
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:38.660]  so over-the-top words can't describe it let's go to Rob who's a New York Coast
[2:55:38.660 --> 2:55:43.840]  Guard internal survey on confiscation Rob quickly thanks for holding tell us
[2:55:43.840 --> 2:55:48.440]  what you know Alex don't want to speak with you and thanks for everything what
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:53.360]  you're doing to get the message out there thank you sir off back in the early 1990
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:59.480]  I'm going back maybe 1992-93 they did surveys back then with the US military
[2:55:59.480 --> 2:56:03.520]  and a lot of servicemen says no we won't fire upon American people you know
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:07.280]  cockpit if there was ever more you know that was in the news actually about 94
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:11.960]  it was Clinton yes so they've tried this before the good news is they try we
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:17.640]  fight they try we fight it's an eternal battle go ahead right exactly so what
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:22.320]  they did was since the United States military said no they says okay we'll
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:27.360]  bring in foreign troops on the United Nations they did and yep and they hit
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:32.040]  them in these United Nations biospheres around the country well they don't even
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:35.280]  hide them they do the open training now under NLE and all the rest of it God
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:40.280]  bless you great points your comments on that dr. Garrow well I mean let's face
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:44.960]  it these people are planning they got a long-range plan in place I think the
[2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:49.560]  Hagle thing is a rather big oops moment but don't you think I mean here's the
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:53.480]  honesty coming out but don't you think that poor Obama's got to go on you
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:56:57.080]  shouldn't have said that in public but we have the benefit of honesty for a
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:02.360]  change well I mean Hagel has been to Bilderberg Hagel is somebody they really
[2:57:02.360 --> 2:57:06.720]  like you know 90 plus percent of the votes when he won the Senate were counted
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:11.000]  on accompanying he owned so that should give you an idea about old old Mr.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:16.200]  Hagel let's jam in one more real quick captain Briggs in Illinois go ahead
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:24.000]  good day El Jefe El Guapo Alexander one and dr. Garrow here I'm back and forth
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:28.840]  between Texas Illinois and New Jersey and I actually spoke to my son is on
[2:57:28.840 --> 2:57:32.560]  active duty in Hawaii the words from the troops around those three specific
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:35.720]  areas is no they were not far in the American people and when things go down
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:40.400]  the National Guard guys will melt back into the populace and for those guys
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:45.360]  like the young marine called in earlier do the right thing maintain your oath
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:50.040]  remember your values and those of you who are being displaced from the cater
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:53.360]  Obama's ranks take care of your neighborhood and do it that's to
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:57.960]  peacefully as possible but prepare for contingencies well yeah again they're
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:58:02.160]  gonna stage a false flag or use some other real crisis to come after
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:04.640]  everybody and I don't think they're gonna get away with it I mean for those
[2:58:04.640 --> 2:58:08.560]  that just tuned in Senator Hagel was in the Washington Post they were quoting
[2:58:08.560 --> 2:58:11.760]  him in a meeting saying you can't trust the military they're not under your
[2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:15.880]  command well that's because we know for the military's actions they've been
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:21.960]  refusing unlawful orders I want to thank dr. Jim Garrow for joining us he helps

[3:01:01.680 --> 3:01:07.040]  local news and they hadn't even finished locking the building down and the
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:11.760]  reporter goes well let's go back to the congressional hearings that
[3:01:11.760 --> 3:01:20.040]  coincidentally are being held over the gun violence and Kathy Gifford is having
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:27.320]  you know her speech there pushing all this propaganda from Obama and that
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:31.880]  this guy Mark Kelly goes yeah I have information that there was a shooting in
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:36.680]  Phoenix Arizona this morning with multiple injuries and the people weren't
[3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:42.440]  even at the hospital yet being reported locally but they already knew inside the
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:46.960]  congressional hearing well that's because Homeland Security is wired into all
[3:01:46.960 --> 3:01:50.440]  the local police departments now and but we need to time that because they this
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:53.240]  won't be the first time they screwed up if that's what happened sometimes they
[3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:57.240]  reported before it even starts and that's how we catch them yeah and it but
[3:01:57.240 --> 3:02:02.320]  he was knowing that there was multiple multiple injuries and yeah it's called
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:06.800]  it's called jumping the gun I'll have to look into that we were recording it
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:10.880]  this morning and so we'll look into it thank you so much great point by the way
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:16.720]  Aaron Dix ran in with this report MSNBC edit portrays gun owners as heckling
[3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:22.840]  father of Sandy Hook victim a member MSNBC is being sued for editing the
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:27.400]  Zimmerman tape where Zimmerman's going okay there's a guy with a hoodie walking
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:31.840]  around okay yeah well what's he doing he's doing this what color is he looks
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:35.040]  like he's black they edited to yeah there's a guy walking with a hoodie he's
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:40.640]  black and then got caught doing it so this is breaking cable propaganda
[3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:44.320]  network deliberately edits out Sandy Hook family member asking audience a
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:48.400]  question which gun rights advocate responds to and makes it look like
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:55.400]  heckling we're going to let's add the part about Zimmerman in here I think
[3:02:55.400 --> 3:02:59.760]  that's very very important to show they have a history of this speaking of MSNBC
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:08.680]  let's go to a clip of one of their people on their saying crackers again get
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:12.520]  white people to think everybody who's of color is racist this is open race
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:16.960]  spading this this is racism to create racism for divide and conquer here it is
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:21.280]  that those you know crazy crackers on the right like if they start with their
[3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:26.880]  very hateful language that is going to kill them in the 506 the death knell
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:31.080]  for Republicans is the tone of the conversation they absolutely have even
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:37.560]  gonna have a white woman this Finney come out and say it and and it's led by
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:40.760]  that you don't turn your guns in you're a racist cracker you don't turn your
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:44.800]  guns in your southerners or trash Al Sharpton got to overcome the southerners
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:49.520]  in the Constitution I mean it's just it's absolute we're northerners we're
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:52.680]  gonna get the southerners trying to get northerners to act like that when
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:56.120]  northerners aren't like that it's we have the Al Sharpton about drones here's
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:00.040]  Al Sharpton about don't worry your guns mean nothing we got the drones now here
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:04.800]  it is I mean if you look at the Second Amendment it was that you would have
[3:04:04.800 --> 3:04:09.960]  militia to protect yourself in case the government came and attack citizens
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:15.280]  first of all if the government were to come to disarm you you would not be able
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:19.520]  to use an automatic weapon to defend you saying game over serious in the world of
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:25.520]  drones now so the Second Amendment was not helping you in that area we're
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:30.440]  talking about people do not have the right to unregulated rights you see and
[3:04:30.440 --> 3:04:33.320]  everybody's really smiling when they hear about the drones oh those are our
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:37.920]  drones oh the government loves this yeah the government sworn to kill you I mean
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:41.760]  the people that run the government the globalist set up Planned Parenthood to
[3:04:41.760 --> 3:04:44.280]  make sure most of you weren't born and but it's like the government's our
[3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:47.480]  friend it's that same look like little kids like they've been after sitting on
[3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:52.400]  Santa Claus's lap government loves me oh we got the drones now we got the drones
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:56.080]  they got the drones meanwhile what is it more than half your men end up in
[3:04:56.080 --> 3:05:09.520]  prison missus so sick it's so sick so sick
