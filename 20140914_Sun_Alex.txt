[00:00.000 --> 00:09.440]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[00:09.440 --> 00:11.800]  the mind of man.
[00:11.800 --> 00:29.200]  Welcome, welcome, welcome everyone out there listening to my voice.
[00:29.200 --> 00:30.720]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.160]  We're going to be here live for the next two hours until 4 p.m. central.
[00:34.160 --> 00:40.400]  You can catch us every day during the week 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central and it's the Alex
[00:40.400 --> 00:41.400]  Jones show.
[00:41.400 --> 00:44.040]  I'm your host Rob Dew and we've got quite a show for you.
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.280]  Next segment we're going to have Paul Watson coming in through Skype, the magic of Skype.
[00:49.280 --> 00:50.880]  From across the river we're going to be talking about Ebola.
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.840]  I have a whole plethora of information on Ebola that we're going to be covering from
[00:55.840 --> 00:59.280]  the government's preparation that they're not telling you about to the fact that they've
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.240]  known this thing can be airborne and for at least 25 years they've known this and we're
[01:04.240 --> 01:06.120]  going to go over all that coming up.
[01:06.120 --> 01:07.560]  We've got quite a show for you.
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.000]  We're going to be covering the latest ISIS news if you don't know that ISIS has released
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.800]  a third professional quality beheading video.
[01:17.800 --> 01:18.800]  This guy's a Brit.
[01:18.800 --> 01:22.000]  We're going to be covering that and what it means.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.040]  They've released tons of videos before them capturing Syrians and Iraqis and cutting their
[01:27.040 --> 01:29.280]  heads off and decapitating them.
[01:29.280 --> 01:33.880]  But these videos that really don't show any of the brutal carnage of it seem to really
[01:33.880 --> 01:37.840]  hit home with the American public and the government.
[01:37.840 --> 01:39.640]  There's the article today in Infowars.com.
[01:39.640 --> 01:40.640]  There's yesterday video.
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.280]  ISIS reportedly behead the British aid worker and then they bring up another one saying
[01:45.280 --> 01:49.000]  they're going to do him next and Ebola news.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.640]  We have four doctors now in the United States who are two have recovered.
[01:54.640 --> 01:55.640]  One's in Atlanta.
[01:55.640 --> 01:57.400]  One's up in Nebraska.
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.320]  So they're importing this stuff everywhere.
[01:59.320 --> 02:03.560]  Just as Alex Jones predicted they're going to be importing Ebola all into the United
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.040]  States and they're literally flushing the waste down the toilet into the public sewer
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.040]  system.
[02:09.040 --> 02:10.040]  We're going to be going over that.
[02:10.040 --> 02:18.280]  In addition to ISIS we've got a little bit of NFL news I might cover.
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.640]  We've got both sides of the aisle coming back with ISIS saying we got to attack.
[02:22.640 --> 02:23.640]  We got to attack.
[02:23.640 --> 02:26.200]  So this is both sides ramping up for war.
[02:26.200 --> 02:28.000]  You've got it in Britain.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.400]  People who were normally for individual sovereignty and freedom.
[02:32.400 --> 02:37.400]  People like Nigel Farage are now saying we have to give up our liberty for security.
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.040]  And that's going to be the call as we march towards this global new world order.
[02:42.040 --> 02:43.040]  Like I said, I'm Rob Dews.
[02:43.040 --> 02:45.440]  This is my first time to be hosting the show like this.
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.200]  I'm very honored to be doing it.
[02:48.200 --> 02:51.000]  Just a quick quick buy about myself.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.480]  I've always been a person that's like to look behind the curtain.
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.320]  And back when I was in college I picked up these two books here.
[02:58.320 --> 03:04.240]  One is Nundare College Conspiracy by Gary Allen and the other one is Who Runs Congress.
[03:04.240 --> 03:07.800]  And that was from the Ralph Nader Congress project.
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.920]  Both books were instrumental in my waking up to what's really going on.
[03:11.920 --> 03:18.120]  Not the left-right paradigm that most people are caught in, but to the global crime syndicate
[03:18.120 --> 03:22.080]  and how it operates here in America and how it operates worldwide.
[03:22.080 --> 03:24.000]  It's not just here that it's operating.
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.240]  It's going all over the place.
[03:25.240 --> 03:27.440]  We're going to have quite a show for you today.
[03:27.440 --> 03:30.520]  Like I said, Paul Watson is going to be coming up in the next hour.
[03:30.520 --> 03:35.120]  And if anybody knows about Ebola and where it's going, it's Paul Watson.
[03:35.120 --> 03:38.040]  He's been on this since the beginning.
[03:38.040 --> 03:43.960]  We've been writing articles about Ebola for a long time here at Infowars.com, trying to
[03:43.960 --> 03:46.320]  show the progression of this.
[03:46.320 --> 03:51.400]  And one thing I want to go to here in a second is this video model that has been coming out
[03:51.400 --> 03:54.560]  that came out on the 10th of September.
[03:54.560 --> 03:57.800]  There's a video model showing how it would spread.
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.040]  And now they're saying it's going to kill about 5 million people.
[04:00.040 --> 04:03.640]  Well, in this model, and you guys can bring it up anytime, if you're watching on Prison
[04:03.640 --> 04:06.680]  Planet TV.tv, you can see it.
[04:06.680 --> 04:08.160]  It starts in Africa.
[04:08.160 --> 04:13.200]  When it comes over to our hemisphere, it starts in Cuba.
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.320]  And it's interesting that Cuba has just sent a bunch of doctors to go help.
[04:16.320 --> 04:22.600]  And then it moves into Florida and then into the United States through Miami.
[04:22.600 --> 04:26.280]  So that's very interesting how this model took into account all this stuff.
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.800]  And it's really looking at, it's pretty scary how this stuff is all going to spread.
[04:31.800 --> 04:33.680]  And we're going to be right back.
[04:33.680 --> 04:34.680]  One minute break.
[04:34.680 --> 04:35.680]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[04:35.680 --> 04:40.160]  We're going to be back with Paul Joseph Watson talking about Ebola and a whole host of issues
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.280]  that you should be concerned about.
[04:41.280 --> 04:42.480]  So call your friends.
[04:42.480 --> 04:43.480]  Get ready.
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.480]  Strap yourselves in.
[04:44.480 --> 04:45.480]  It's going to be two more hours.
[04:45.480 --> 04:58.560]  We'll be right back.
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.960]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[05:03.960 --> 05:05.720]  toxic each and every day.
[05:05.720 --> 05:08.240]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.120]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[05:12.120 --> 05:17.480]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[05:17.480 --> 05:18.480]  within their homes.
[05:18.480 --> 05:21.880]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[05:21.880 --> 05:25.880]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[05:25.880 --> 05:29.360]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[05:29.360 --> 05:30.360]  to as well.
[05:30.360 --> 05:34.520]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[05:34.520 --> 05:39.520]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.800]  back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[05:44.800 --> 05:49.200]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[05:49.200 --> 05:51.320]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[05:51.320 --> 06:10.000]  How available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3888-2533139.
