[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11.000 --> 00:23.000]  It's a holiday, it's a holiday, welcome to your holiday.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  Yes, that is a bad imitation of the great Gerald Cilente.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  When he talks about holidays, they have the bank holidays where they steal all your money,
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  in some cases all your money out of your bank account after taxes.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  The loving EU to pay it directly to private bankers.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  But this holiday is Ishtar Day, Easter Day.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  You know, Playboy Day, the day when the rabbits fornicate
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  and so you then have them lay eggs to Ishtar.
[00:54.000 --> 01:03.000]  It is the day of spring or regeneration or the day that Christ was risen from the dead.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  But you notice that every major religious holiday Christians have has been overwritten
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  by the pagans that have been basically overwriting the Christian faith for 2,000 years.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  That's what's been going on.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  So I thought I would just talk about that gospel mystery a little bit.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  It is no mystery. Christmas is supposedly the time of the birth of Christ.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  Now it's about a big drunk guy in a red outfit that comes down your chimney
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  and well, acts like Freddy Krueger chopping up your family in little pieces.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  That's what Santa Claus was 200 years ago in England.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  It was a night of rioting, Christmas was banned.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  You can actually look that up.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  I know it's all supposedly about Saint Nick and the guy that handed out presents to sick children.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  Over there in the Dutch areas of the realm.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  But my point is, what are fables, what are legends if they're not archetypal images?
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  And so I just thought on this Easter Bunny day that I would point out that they're overwriting everything.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  I mean, what was liberty this country was founded on?
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  The Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  Now liberty means TSA putting their hand in the cookie jar to make sure not al-Qaeda
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  that al-Qaeda is the good guys, but to make sure white al-Qaeda.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  The evil white al-Qaeda is not hiding under there.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  So that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down here today.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  Look at this article up at Infowars.com.
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  I didn't get to this on Friday, but I wish I may, I wish I might cover this piece of news tonight
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  here on this 31st day of March 2013.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  It's a little story here up on the side.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  I'm trying to find it.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  I had it printed out in front of me.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  Fox drama constitutionalist work for terrorist serial murderers.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  Well actually they are serial terrorist murderers who were very impressed that they're constitutionalist
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  because that's the dirtiest, nastiest thing on earth you can be.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  It brings a big smile to the chief killer's face.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  And so everything is now Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL script, brainwashing the poor,
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  hapless public.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  And I just hope to point out to people that a free society does not have this type of
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  full metal jacketed tyranny being sprayed out by the globalist media.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  I mean you could have like messages, you know, back in the 60s about equality and stuff and
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  planet and shows, or feminism and Mary Tyler Moore, all seems reasonable.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  But then now you see it sets the precedent today to just absolutely have a war on reality,
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  which the new magazine, Infowars Magazine, welcome to Planet Hoax.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  You can sign up at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter, Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

[03:57.000 --> 04:05.000]  send the digital out to everyone who subscribes there to the email blast and update alerts
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  and things.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  We don't send out a lot.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.000]  A couple of things a week.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  It's always really important videos or information.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  And once a month, we send it out a few times.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  People always miss it.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  The digital copy of Infowars Magazine with a lot of exclusive material and also the top
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  stories of the few weeks before we publish it from Infowars.com and present.com.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  And I'd say it supports us, but we sell it at cost, the subscription and the bulk, you
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  can buy them in bulk.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  So it's really about supporting your own future and being part of the Infowar and resisting.

[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  people up.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  It will certainly shake them out of their days because in a world of universal deceit,
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  More of that with our special guest straight ahead.

[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  You want answers?
[06:11.000 --> 06:13.000]  Well so does he.
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[06:17.000 --> 06:23.000]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  It's been out for a couple days but didn't get attention until last night it was in some
[06:30.000 --> 06:38.000]  of the establishment prostitute media, the dinosaur media, praising Jim Carrey.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  I've seen him in interviews.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  I mean I think he genuinely is mentally ill.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  He's kind of a geek.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  That's why it's funny to watch him literally denigrate and in this disgusting five-minute
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  song, we're going to go over some of the lyrics to it here today and it's got some profanity
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  so we won't play all of it.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  Say that gun owners but that Chuck Heston, Charlton Heston, a true humanitarian, a true
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.400]  civil rights activist, a patriot, that he is guilty for dead kids, that he won't be
[07:07.400 --> 07:12.000]  going to heaven and that he's mentally ill and believes in space aliens.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.500]  And it was just so ham-fisted and so pathetic I got angry and I figured it out last night.
[07:16.500 --> 07:19.200]  I couldn't even go to sleep, folks, and I can go to sleep in like one minute.
[07:19.200 --> 07:21.200]  I can just turn my brain off.
[07:21.200 --> 07:23.400]  I was so upset I couldn't go to bed till like two in the morning.
[07:23.400 --> 07:29.340]  I shot like three videos for the YouTube channel because I realized these people are so pathetic
[07:29.340 --> 07:35.840]  and such liars and such hypocrites with their bodyguards and so anti-individual and so wrong
[07:35.840 --> 07:40.500]  and so authoritarian that I'm angry that we have not routed them out.
[07:40.500 --> 07:46.600]  Now, I called a very busy individual but he's obviously very angry about what's happening
[07:46.600 --> 07:47.600]  as well.
[07:47.600 --> 07:48.760]  I talked to him this morning on his cell phone.
[07:48.760 --> 07:53.960]  Ted Nugent, who needs no introduction, NRA board member, you know, top rock and roller
[07:53.960 --> 07:55.920]  patriot hunter.
[07:55.920 --> 08:00.000]  I called him on his cell phone a couple hours ago and I said, can you come on about Charlton
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  Heston?
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.240]  I know you were very good friends with him and really got him to get more hardcore on
[08:03.240 --> 08:04.240]  the Second Amendment.
[08:04.240 --> 08:05.500]  He said, absolutely.
[08:05.500 --> 08:10.780]  It was Ted Nugent that helped supercharge Charlton Heston into the fight at many levels.
[08:10.780 --> 08:15.720]  So here is his friend to defend Chuck Charlton Heston because he can't do it.
[08:15.720 --> 08:16.720]  He's dead.
[08:16.720 --> 08:18.360]  Ted, you've got the floor, my friend.
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.360]  You've got the floor.
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.000]  Thank you for coming on TedNugent.com.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.960]  I know you're about to go on your Black Power tour, but we appreciate you giving us time
[08:26.960 --> 08:27.960]  today.
[08:27.960 --> 08:28.960]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.960]  Well, Alex, thank you for that.
[08:29.960 --> 08:30.960]  I appreciate it.
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.520]  And I look back at you because there's no question that the great American legend and
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.960]  icon, a true warrior, a true hero, Charlton Heston, deserves nothing but respect from
[08:41.960 --> 08:45.520]  thinking, caring, conscientious, educated people.
[08:45.520 --> 08:51.560]  But again, as we talked before about the gift from God that Piers Morgan represents, I mean,
[08:51.560 --> 08:58.040]  God literally sent Piers Morgan from England to try to debate the Second Amendment.
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.440]  He literally couldn't come up with Alfred E. Newman versus an audition for One Flew
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.880]  Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to come up with a better representative of a guy who hates freedom
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.320]  and hates the Second Amendment and hates Ted Nugent and Alex Orange and hates the NRA and
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.680]  hates self-defense and hates guns.
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.120]  And I think we are not here so much to defend Charlton Heston because once again, God has
[09:21.120 --> 09:29.840]  sent a complete brain-dead, soulless punk to desecrate the absolutely well-earned and
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.040]  deserved glowing reputation of the great Charlton Heston.
[09:34.040 --> 09:39.240]  And what Jim Carrey has done, and I've been all over, we have a talk back at TedNugent.com
[09:39.240 --> 09:43.880]  and we have thousands of people from all around the world that come to celebrate self-evident
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.000]  truth and common sense, you know, the same communication that you get, Alex, from people
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.240]  who understand, you know, history, the evidence that brought us to the greatest experience
[09:53.240 --> 09:56.080]  and the greatest quality of life in America.
[09:56.080 --> 10:03.240]  And when a guy like Jim Carrey pulls off this kind of mean-spirited, soulless, I think the
[10:03.240 --> 10:08.880]  best word to describe Jim Carrey and Piers Morgan and guys like, you know, Michael, I'm
[10:08.880 --> 10:16.560]  still looking for personal hygiene more, they're all one big gaggle of soulless punks.
[10:16.560 --> 10:22.720]  And I would understand, and I understand when a person is uneducated and ignorant and hates
[10:22.720 --> 10:28.240]  America and hates self-defense and doesn't believe in self-defense, but then again, if
[10:28.240 --> 10:35.920]  you examine Michael Moore and his armed security detail, if you examine Jim Carrey and his
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.720]  armed security detail, when you examine Michael Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo and Nancy, you
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.120]  don't have to read this, you need to sign it Pelosi, and of course our favorite gun
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.600]  runner, Eric Holder, when you examine the freedom haters who hate guns and want to do
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.080]  everything on film stating clearly they would take away all the guns if they could, these
[10:58.080 --> 11:05.280]  people are perfect to represent the other side because when they open their mouth, yes,
[11:05.280 --> 11:14.200]  we have an unfortunate and a tragic percentage of Americans who are more like sheep than
[11:14.200 --> 11:22.840]  we the people that support these freedom haters, when they speak, common sense America, people
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.280]  who have jobs, people who put their heart and soul into being the best that they can
[11:27.280 --> 11:33.080]  be, people who appreciate the gift of life, the sacred gift of life, and our moral, intellectual
[11:33.080 --> 11:37.920]  and spiritual obligation to defend that life, and that the Second Amendment was written
[11:37.920 --> 11:45.800]  down to remind us we have the individual God-given right to defend that precious gift of life,
[11:45.800 --> 11:52.440]  good people understand the pure rot from Jim Carrey.
[11:52.440 --> 12:02.520]  So in his grave, Alex, let's really examine this, from the grave, the great Charlton Heston
[12:02.520 --> 12:09.600]  represents fate to the Jim Carrey's of the world, and I think Charlton Heston, if we
[12:09.600 --> 12:15.240]  could communicate with him, he would be smiling right now, he wouldn't be hurt, he would
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.400]  be smiling because Charlton Heston knew the culture of war was coming before any of us
[12:19.400 --> 12:26.760]  did, Alex, and here's the beauty, Charlton Heston would be more than proud to cause much
[12:26.760 --> 12:36.960]  anguish and insanity in the soulless vacuum of Jim Carrey's brain, or his skull, Charlton
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.640]  Heston is like you and I, Alex, only he's better, and he is just giddy with joy that
[12:43.640 --> 12:52.680]  he has inspired Jim Carrey to become even dumber than dumb, and to be just this toxic
[12:52.680 --> 13:02.320]  source of indecency and mean spirit and hate, Charlton Heston isn't even alive, and he
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.280]  caused Jim Carrey to expose his soullessness.
[13:06.280 --> 13:13.680]  So don't underestimate in the culture war, more important than the lie of holding for
[13:13.680 --> 13:20.900]  Columbine by Michael, no hygiene more, and Nancy, no soul Pelosi, and Diane, I've got
[13:20.900 --> 13:25.960]  a gun but you don't get to have one, Feinstein, I mean the list goes on of just hypocritical
[13:25.960 --> 13:34.000]  brain dead subhuman punks, or not to mention, Alex, the Vice President of the United States
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  recommending felonies live on TV, you gotta be kidding me, Alex, again, if you and I were
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.200]  to sit down with all the greatest minds on earth, the most clever, educated, witty, brilliant
[13:49.200 --> 13:57.360]  minds on earth, we couldn't design an enemy that looks more ridiculous than Nancy Pelosi,
[13:57.360 --> 14:05.440]  Dianne Feinstein, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Jim Carrey, Michael Moore, odd
[14:05.440 --> 14:11.960]  nauseum, so yes, it is hurtful, and it does inspire righteous indignation, and we should
[14:11.960 --> 14:18.160]  be angry, but we should also take a deep breath and go, hey Jim, do it again, because you're
[14:18.160 --> 14:24.760]  distancing yourself further every time you open your imbecilic mouth, surrounded by your
[14:24.760 --> 14:31.160]  armed security details, demanding that the rest of us don't get to have any security,
[14:31.160 --> 14:41.100]  so Alex, I know it hurts and it's ugly, but you know what, I think in Nuremberg 1938,
[14:41.100 --> 14:46.920]  we got there late, but when we finally got there, we made those subhuman Nazi brown shirt
[14:46.920 --> 14:54.640]  punks walk through Auschwitz and look what they caused, look what they did, and this
[14:54.640 --> 15:02.760]  Jim Carrey moment is a mirror that we can show somebody hopefully soon that these people
[15:02.760 --> 15:11.840]  enhance crime, they encourage crime, they facilitate and guarantee more innocent dead
[15:11.840 --> 15:12.840]  citizens.
[15:12.840 --> 15:13.840]  Sure.
[15:13.840 --> 15:20.560]  Well, that's it, they know, Ted Nugent joining us, they know crimes dropped 49% violent crime
[15:20.560 --> 15:26.440]  FBI statistics since 1991, as the guns go up, the crime goes down, they know that, so
[15:26.440 --> 15:33.000]  it is a criminal instinct of hypocrisy to want to dominate us because they're collectivist,
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.240]  but end up getting our banker bailout money, they are just lawless parasites, Michael Moore,
[15:39.240 --> 15:44.880]  all of them, they know exactly, Dianne Feinstein, she's got her own gun, she's got her own security
[15:44.880 --> 16:00.880]  detail, they have this, I'll say it, criminal instinct to disarm us, absolutely.
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.600]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.640]  immunity and health.
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.240]  With silver lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

[16:19.760 --> 16:25.480]  ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.

[16:29.500 --> 16:34.120]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[16:34.120 --> 16:39.280]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.840]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.840]  skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[17:04.900 --> 17:08.960]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.720]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[20:04.720 --> 20:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:19.000 --> 20:25.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[20:25.440 --> 20:36.760]  GCN Radio Network.
[20:36.760 --> 20:43.320]  Come on baby, it is hard to fade down that music and the man that created it, Ted Nugent
[20:43.320 --> 20:44.320]  is with us.
[20:44.320 --> 20:47.120]  And the more I get to know Ted Nugent, obviously I've known him for years, he's been coming
[20:47.120 --> 20:50.800]  on the show for probably 15 years, but the more I really get to know him, he is such
[20:50.800 --> 20:51.800]  a patriot.
[20:51.800 --> 20:54.520]  And you notice as things get more hardcore, he gets more hardcore.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.840]  And I wanted to talk to him about how to beat these people.
[20:56.840 --> 21:01.560]  We're going to get to the fun of guns after we cover the more serious topics in a moment.
[21:01.560 --> 21:05.080]  But before we do that, remember this broadcast is listener supported.
[21:05.080 --> 21:10.040]  We're building the news organization, the nightly news, the films, the monthly magazine,
[21:10.040 --> 21:14.560]  everything we're doing isn't funded by banker bailouts and taxpayer money like MSNBC and
[21:14.560 --> 21:15.560]  CNN.
[21:15.560 --> 21:17.360]  It is funded by your support.
[21:17.360 --> 21:23.520]  And so I go out and find the best products that I can find, get the best deal, buy them
[21:23.520 --> 21:28.480]  in bulk and sell them at the lowest price like the stainless steel, propure water filtration
[21:28.480 --> 21:31.800]  system that blows away the competition.
[21:31.800 --> 21:34.700]  Very important to have clean water, so it's a win, win, win.
[21:34.700 --> 21:41.800]  You can get that at Infowarsstore.com, that's Infowars, one word, store.com.
[21:41.800 --> 21:44.980]  You can also find all the pros second amendment.
[21:44.980 --> 21:49.740]  Come and take it with a M16 or AK-47 with the right to keep and bear arms, shall not
[21:49.740 --> 21:53.400]  be infringed inside the gun, best selling shirt out there.
[21:53.400 --> 22:00.760]  People are getting them all over the country, camouflage, Infowars.com, ball caps, the films,
[22:00.760 --> 22:01.760]  the materials.
[22:01.760 --> 22:06.560]  It is a culture war, so wear your uniform, folks, and meet like-minded people.
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.320]  We have the Obama Joker tyrant shirt, limited edition.
[22:10.320 --> 22:16.440]  We have the new 1776 Spirit of Liberty shirt that just came out with Paul Revere riding
[22:16.440 --> 22:20.240]  on it with M16s crossed on the front and the back.
[22:20.240 --> 22:26.720]  Just amazing at Infowarsstore.com, and the more you fuel us in mid-air refueling, the
[22:26.720 --> 22:30.240]  more you fund us, the more we're gonna get the word out.
[22:30.240 --> 22:35.440]  In fact, I'm about to put 1 million bumper stickers in the new, not this month, but the
[22:35.440 --> 22:42.680]  next month magazine, 1 million of them, 6 bumper stickers per magazine going out.
[22:42.680 --> 22:45.280]  One of them is the second amendment sticker, the others are Infowars.
[22:45.280 --> 22:52.640]  It's time to get aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, and support TedNugent.com.
[22:52.640 --> 22:56.800]  The New World Order types love to act like we're all alone, that we don't have any power,
[22:56.800 --> 22:57.800]  that we're weirdos.
[22:57.800 --> 23:02.280]  At the end of the Charlton Heston demonization video where they say he killed the kids, God
[23:02.280 --> 23:06.800]  hates him, he's going to hell, he's a psycho, he's scum, he blows his foot off.
[23:06.800 --> 23:13.040]  At the end of the attempted defaming that falls flat on its face by the little scrofulous
[23:13.040 --> 23:19.040]  creature Jim Carrey and his masters, at the end of the whole video, you realize that these
[23:19.040 --> 23:25.080]  people are just pathetic and that all they've done is give us another tool to show what
[23:25.080 --> 23:26.440]  scum they are.
[23:26.440 --> 23:30.940]  But we are in a culture war and at the end of the video, they all laugh at Charlton Heston
[23:30.940 --> 23:36.800]  and laugh at gun owners and you're supposed to feel like you're alone at the end.
[23:36.800 --> 23:41.120]  You're supposed to feel like as there's blood all over Charlton Heston, you're supposed
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.160]  to feel like you're a moron because this scum laughed at you.
[23:46.160 --> 23:49.000]  That's all peer pressure manipulation.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.760]  These people are the scum and they really are the degenerate scum.
[23:53.760 --> 23:59.180]  What do you say about really getting aggressive, then get into DHS, get into still touring,
[23:59.180 --> 24:02.120]  getting bigger every day, the wake up that's happening.
[24:02.120 --> 24:05.240]  I want to get into Uncle Ted's advice in this war.
[24:05.240 --> 24:06.720]  Ted Nugent, you've got the floor.
[24:06.720 --> 24:11.440]  Well, Alex, when you recommend getting more aggressive, surely you've seen the YouTube
[24:11.440 --> 24:18.840]  video of me holding up a bunch of drum fed AR-15s on stage and telling Nancy Pelosi,
[24:18.840 --> 24:24.840]  then Senator Barack Obama, Barbara Baca, and Dianne Feinstein, et al. to suck on my machine
[24:24.840 --> 24:25.840]  guns.
[24:25.840 --> 24:26.840]  Should I get more aggressive than that?
[24:26.840 --> 24:27.840]  No, I think, no, no.
[24:27.840 --> 24:28.840]  I'm telling, I'm not telling you that.
[24:28.840 --> 24:29.840]  I'm telling the public.
[24:29.840 --> 24:35.920]  I know what you mean, and we love you madly, but I do believe that I may be the only guy
[24:35.920 --> 24:39.600]  on the planet who's got a couple notches up the aggressive chart from Alex.
[24:39.600 --> 24:40.600]  Oh, no, no, no.
[24:40.600 --> 24:41.600]  Let me be clear.
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.600]  I agree with you.
[24:42.600 --> 24:45.600]  I'm telling the audience, I think it's time to get aggressive.
[24:45.600 --> 24:46.600]  What do you say then?
[24:46.600 --> 24:51.100]  I just thought I'd make sure, if people listening right now to us, Alex, haven't Googled my
[24:51.100 --> 24:55.360]  name lately, get yourself some popcorn and a couple of big gulps.
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.360]  You're right.
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.760]  And Google Ted Nugent and watch me drive the liberals berserk.
[25:00.760 --> 25:02.520]  That's what I do sometimes on Saturday nights.
[25:02.520 --> 25:03.680]  I literally do.
[25:03.680 --> 25:04.680]  Go watch your latest YouTube.
[25:04.680 --> 25:11.000]  I mean, it's just, and by the way, Alex, I have, my wife will tell you, I never in my
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.600]  life have woke up in the morning, rub my hands together, got a wild eye look in my face and
[25:16.600 --> 25:19.640]  gone, what can I do to drive liberals batty?
[25:19.640 --> 25:21.800]  I've never given it a thought.
[25:21.800 --> 25:29.360]  Swear to God, my instincts, I'm going to stand up for truth, logic, the logic and pragmatism
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.200]  that brings independent quality of life.
[25:32.200 --> 25:34.520]  And I celebrate and promote those things.
[25:34.520 --> 25:36.600]  I started promoting, never defending.
[25:36.600 --> 25:41.000]  I have never defended the second amendment or backstraps.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.960]  I've never defended anything.
[25:43.960 --> 25:52.360]  I promote and celebrate all good things, self-evident truth, logic, good will, decency and the American
[25:52.360 --> 25:53.360]  way.
[25:53.360 --> 26:00.440]  And I found out as early as 1965, 1966, the beatniks were morphing into the hippies and
[26:00.440 --> 26:02.440]  they hated me.
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.760]  And I sat back for a minute, I go, you hate me because I believe in self-defense and I
[26:07.760 --> 26:08.760]  eat venison?
[26:08.760 --> 26:09.760]  Are you kidding me?
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.880]  But here's the bottom line.
[26:11.880 --> 26:18.400]  I would love to get Pelosi and Boxer and Feinstein and Michael Moore and Jim Carrey and Bill
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.440]  Maher and Piers Morgan, I'd like them to get on film and admit how much dope have you
[26:25.440 --> 26:26.440]  smoking?
[26:26.440 --> 26:32.400]  How many mind altered, and I'm not alleging they have, allegedly, they told me that they
[26:32.400 --> 26:38.720]  talk and conduct themselves like cesspools of mind altering drugs.
[26:38.720 --> 26:45.520]  And I bet you, if you got everybody that hates Ted Nugent and Alex Jones and the NRA and
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.960]  Freedom in America, if you got all of them to take some truth serum and look in the camera
[26:50.960 --> 26:57.280]  and admit how much mind altering substance abuse they've subjected themselves to for
[26:57.280 --> 27:03.960]  how long, no one would be surprised that they are Timothy Leary run amok.
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.880]  And that's what you can express to those kind of people.
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.520]  When you have intentionally poisoned and destroyed your brain, you can come out with a video
[27:10.520 --> 27:11.520]  like Jim Carrey has.
[27:11.520 --> 27:14.520]  Well, let me throw this at you briefly and then get into all those other topics we talked
[27:14.520 --> 27:15.520]  about during the break.
[27:15.520 --> 27:16.520]  Again, Ted Nugent's our guest.
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.520]  If you just tuned in and he's on fire today after they've tried to desecrate and demonize
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.840]  Charlton Heston, I believe it will blow up in their face.
[27:23.840 --> 27:30.960]  Buzz Bissinger was on the Piers Morgan show a few days after I was on there and he said,
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.900]  you know, we ought to get him in here and shoot him.
[27:33.900 --> 27:40.520]  And then the ambassador's daughter, Huntsman's daughter and Morgan agree and say, yeah, I'll
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.220]  put on a police uniform and they fetishize that real creepy and we'll shoot Alex Jones.
[27:46.220 --> 27:51.640]  And then Buzz Bissinger has now come out and admitted he likes to buy $600,000 a year of
[27:51.640 --> 27:52.640]  women's clothing.
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.640]  And I mean, my whole issue is what is the point of this?
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.720]  I mean, you know, this guy is, if I said, kill him, which I'm not, I mean, that's like
[28:02.720 --> 28:04.720]  going out in the yard and stepping on dog crap.
[28:04.720 --> 28:07.880]  If I said, kill him, I would be arrested.
[28:07.880 --> 28:08.980]  He said, kill me.
[28:08.980 --> 28:09.980]  And then it's a joke.
[28:09.980 --> 28:16.000]  These people fetishize killing us and they're constantly talking about killing constitutionalist.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.720]  There's you know, there's so many examples of this with people like Alec Baldwin, you
[28:19.720 --> 28:20.720]  name it.
[28:20.720 --> 28:25.400]  That's why our instincts, you know, and again, if we go back to what made America great,
[28:25.400 --> 28:30.800]  we didn't meet the British punks at Concord Bridge to make them T and F have a discussion.
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.880]  We blew their brains out.
[28:32.880 --> 28:33.880]  That's how you stop tyrants.
[28:33.880 --> 28:35.880]  That's how you stop King George.
[28:35.880 --> 28:41.320]  That's how you stop despots and emperors and punks that want to control your life and
[28:41.320 --> 28:42.320]  oppress freedom.
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.400]  You meet them at Concord Bridge and you blow their damn brains out.
[28:46.400 --> 29:02.200]  That's what we did in 1776 because we'd about had enough.
[29:02.200 --> 29:08.480]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[29:08.480 --> 29:10.120]  Ben Soap Company.
[29:10.120 --> 29:14.440]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[29:14.440 --> 29:19.200]  These all natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils
[29:19.200 --> 29:21.720]  that are earth friendly and safe.
[29:21.720 --> 29:29.520]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.320]  Buy the one to two month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what

[30:58.960 --> 31:04.680]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[31:04.680 --> 31:06.960]  good sized meal that I was still starving.
[31:06.960 --> 31:11.760]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[31:11.760 --> 31:15.920]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[31:15.920 --> 31:21.480]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[31:21.480 --> 31:24.680]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[31:24.680 --> 31:31.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngchevity.

[33:23.080 --> 33:24.720]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[33:24.720 --> 33:31.200]  The websites are Infowars.com and Infowarsnews.com where we have Infowars Nightly News, Ted Nugent
[33:31.200 --> 33:36.280]  dot com is an amazing website and has a lot of just really cutting edge information on
[33:36.280 --> 33:38.960]  it when it comes to the fight for liberty.
[33:38.960 --> 33:42.360]  And you were talking about the fact this is a war.
[33:42.360 --> 33:43.360]  Ted Nugent.
[33:43.360 --> 33:47.360]  When you made that statement on Piers Morgan, I've seen the transcript.
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.520]  All I can say is duh, hello, self-evident, true to common sense and history is not up
[33:53.520 --> 33:54.520]  for discussion.
[33:54.520 --> 33:56.000]  It is what it is.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.720]  But now in the culture war, it is important that we let them talk.
[34:01.720 --> 34:04.080]  We let them threaten our lives.
[34:04.080 --> 34:10.040]  We let them call the greatest, maybe one of the greatest heroes of the civil rights movement
[34:10.040 --> 34:14.800]  next to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others that sacrificed so much, the freedom marchers
[34:14.800 --> 34:16.200]  and so many.
[34:16.200 --> 34:25.480]  Charlton Heston is the most revered and earned reputation, icon and hero, Alex.
[34:25.480 --> 34:34.600]  So let Jim Carrey show his evil side, let Jim Carrey lie, his entire video is a lie.
[34:34.600 --> 34:42.120]  And these punks like Bill Maher cannot separate their humor license, their creative humor
[34:42.120 --> 34:46.800]  license from the respect due to a great man like Charlton Heston.
[34:46.800 --> 34:53.000]  So it's good that they take the bait, but we, the people who still understand the foundation
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.120]  of the greatest quality of life in the history of the world is outlined in the Bill of Rights
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.800]  and the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence, the Ten Commandments, the Golden
[34:59.800 --> 35:06.160]  Rule, those of us that are in the asset column of America, we still are running short of
[35:06.160 --> 35:12.600]  our responsibilities to educate, inspire, and prod everyone in our lives.
[35:12.600 --> 35:17.440]  There's an enormous army that could have won this last election, Alex, if all of us that
[35:17.440 --> 35:22.720]  knew the truth and knew the evidence, if we shared it and we asked and we really pushed
[35:22.720 --> 35:28.160]  harder to get our friends to join the NRA, to communicate with their elected officials
[35:28.160 --> 35:36.120]  and to speak up, there's still too many sheep in America and the sheep dogs need to educate
[35:36.120 --> 35:39.120]  them so we can reduce the wolves.
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.340]  You're right, and in closing on the point of Charlton Heston before we get into solutions,
[35:44.340 --> 35:51.280]  so many people that support liberty are just quiet and they're sitting back and they're
[35:51.280 --> 35:53.760]  waiting if the system pushes too much.
[35:53.760 --> 35:57.200]  And as Andrew Jackson said, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
[35:57.200 --> 36:00.520]  You know, I understand the point of let the enemy run amok.
[36:00.520 --> 36:01.520]  That's what's discrediting.
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.080]  Polls show that people are more pro-gun now than they were just six months ago.
[36:06.080 --> 36:11.280]  There's a new CBS poll out there, very upset that their whole hoax has failed, but at the
[36:11.280 --> 36:14.680]  same time, they've still got control of the government and the bureaucracy because they
[36:14.680 --> 36:16.240]  crave the control.
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.960]  How do we really get on the offense as individuals?
[36:20.960 --> 36:22.440]  I say go to city councils.
[36:22.440 --> 36:25.480]  I say get in the face of police chiefs that are anti-gun.
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.880]  I mean, my own police chief in Austin says, you know, turn in your semi-autos, ban high
[36:29.880 --> 36:34.600]  capacity clips, ban gun shows, you can't buy your son a gun, no private sales.
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.360]  You don't need a semi-auto to protect yourself.
[36:36.360 --> 36:39.960]  Well, then how about the Austin police, who I know most of them are good people, how about
[36:39.960 --> 36:41.640]  you turn in your semi-autos?
[36:41.640 --> 36:42.640]  What a load of bull.
[36:42.640 --> 36:43.640]  What do you say to that?
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.960]  Well, he's obviously the illegitimate stepchild of Ann Richards, but that still exists.
[36:48.960 --> 36:54.560]  I mean, Sheila Jackson Lee is alive and well in Texas, so we've got anti-freedom.
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.960]  We got hypocrites because I guarantee that chief of police has a semi-auto to protect
[36:58.960 --> 36:59.960]  his family.
[36:59.960 --> 37:01.760]  Alex, are you kidding me?
[37:01.760 --> 37:03.760]  Well, again, it's communication.
[37:03.760 --> 37:05.320]  I've been doing this forever.
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.280]  I think I was one of the first guys to find myself face to face with the whites of their
[37:09.280 --> 37:14.000]  eyes in the culture war back in the 1960s because the tip of that spear has always been
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.360]  gun rights and hunting rights, private property, hunting, conservation.
[37:18.360 --> 37:22.040]  We the people own those resources, not the king.
[37:22.040 --> 37:27.120]  So I got to tell you, I'm going to put out a salute right now to Ranger Tess and Go-Kart
[37:27.120 --> 37:31.200]  and Steve and so many guys that might talk about blood trails.
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.800]  I have thousands and thousands of people, not just from the United States, but Canada,
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.480]  Japan, Australia, Germany, England, Belgium, Sweden.
[37:40.480 --> 37:44.960]  I mean, people from all around the world will dream of, who crave and have the instinct
[37:44.960 --> 37:46.600]  to be independent and free.
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.680]  They come to Ted Nugent.com talkback and a salute to them because for every talkback
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.920]  that you and I communicate with, they need to communicate with another dozen and those
[37:56.920 --> 37:59.760]  dozen need to communicate with another dozen.
[37:59.760 --> 38:01.200]  That's how we win this culture war.
[38:01.200 --> 38:02.960]  We have not turned up the heat.
[38:02.960 --> 38:08.200]  We have not got aggressive enough, but we always have to be on the civil, polite, goodwill
[38:08.200 --> 38:15.560]  and decency side and let the Jim Carries spew their venom, let them expose themselves for
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.800]  the haters and the freedom haters and the America haters that they are.
[38:19.800 --> 38:25.120]  And if we remain civil with the stats and statistics and evidence at our fingertips
[38:25.120 --> 38:27.840]  and at the tip of our tongue, Alex, we will win.
[38:27.840 --> 38:29.200]  That's why I salute you.
[38:29.200 --> 38:33.320]  That's what you're doing and everybody listening, they don't need to call Alex and say thank
[38:33.320 --> 38:34.320]  you.
[38:34.320 --> 38:37.720]  They need to call everybody else in their lives and get them going.
[38:37.720 --> 38:38.720]  You're right.
[38:38.720 --> 38:39.960]  Let's get into solutions.
[38:39.960 --> 38:44.520]  Talk about, because you got caught up on the break, the DHS situation, it's admitting there's
[38:44.520 --> 38:49.760]  an arm build up that they're trying to create this new domestic security force pointed at
[38:49.760 --> 38:51.640]  the American people.
[38:51.640 --> 38:55.800]  But then I want to hear about the Delta Force and SEALs and people you know, you were telling
[38:55.800 --> 38:58.600]  me off air how incredibly awake they're getting.
[38:58.600 --> 39:03.160]  And then let's talk about, let's talk about solutions, the gun culture they're so afraid
[39:03.160 --> 39:11.400]  of that spreading, going and literally getting somebody into guns that one person after another,
[39:11.400 --> 39:12.400]  that's how we're truly going to win.
[39:12.400 --> 39:14.880]  And you see it happening all across this country.
[39:14.880 --> 39:15.880]  Yeah.
[39:15.880 --> 39:18.080]  It's like your chief of police in Austin, isn't it?
[39:18.080 --> 39:24.720]  Isn't that a heartbreaker that a Texas law enforcement officer sides with Nancy Pelosi?
[39:24.720 --> 39:26.720]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[39:26.720 --> 39:27.720]  What do you do?
[39:27.720 --> 39:30.920]  He hit the wall of the Alamo like Ozzy Osbourne?
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.480]  I'm just heartbroken because I know a bunch of those Austin cops, but here's the final
[39:35.480 --> 39:36.480]  overview.
[39:36.480 --> 39:38.800]  I, you know, I'm a lucky guy.
[39:38.800 --> 39:44.640]  I get to hang and barbecue and hunt and train with the greatest commando hero warriors that
[39:44.640 --> 39:45.640]  ever lived.
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.600]  I mean, I am so humbled, I'm surprised I can even grovel at their feet.
[39:50.600 --> 39:59.240]  Delta Force, Navy SEALs, the special ops, the army rangers, SWAT commanders and heroes
[39:59.240 --> 40:03.080]  of law enforcement and military all across this land.
[40:03.080 --> 40:08.880]  I held the hand of Sergeant Todd Baldy, who happened to be from Austin, Alex.
[40:08.880 --> 40:11.560]  I held his hand over in Iraq.
[40:11.560 --> 40:18.080]  He took an RPG center mass, I'll try not to cry on your radio show here, a young black
[40:18.080 --> 40:24.760]  man, 22 years old, RPG center mass, Alex, it was still in his guts.
[40:24.760 --> 40:28.240]  I stood there in his blood and I held his hand as he died.
[40:28.240 --> 40:29.840]  I don't need any more inspiration.
[40:29.840 --> 40:37.880]  He died because he swore an oath, Mr. Chief of Police, to enforce, abide by and fight
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.320]  for and die for the U.S. Constitution.
[40:42.320 --> 40:50.200]  Do you think I need some punk, some dependent little whiny, soulless, doped up crybaby like
[40:50.200 --> 40:57.200]  Jim Carrey to give me direction on constitutional and bill of rights, guaranteed God-given individual
[40:57.200 --> 40:58.200]  rights?
[40:58.200 --> 41:04.840]  So everybody close their eyes right now, unless you're driving, and think of Todd Baldy as
[41:04.840 --> 41:13.920]  he bled to death and took his giant ugly RPG rocket right in the guts and he bled to death
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.560]  fighting for freedom and going after terrorists who attack Americans because of their voodoo
[41:19.560 --> 41:21.560]  ala puke Muslim insanity.
[41:21.560 --> 41:27.440]  And if that's not worth inspiring you to join the NRA to communicate with your elected officials
[41:27.440 --> 41:31.080]  and do your duty as we the people, then I don't think there's any hope for you and you're
[41:31.080 --> 41:33.600]  probably out here just moved to Canada.
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.720]  Well it really is disgusting that these people parade around.
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.540]  In fact, since you mentioned that, and I want to talk about the tour and the culture war
[41:42.540 --> 41:45.200]  having fun, that is the way to defeat them.
[41:45.200 --> 41:51.000]  Obama says post-Assad Syria of Islamist extremism is nightmare scenario.
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.120]  Obama in Libya, in Syria, I'm not saying Gaddafi or the guy in Syria are good guys, but they
[41:57.120 --> 41:59.200]  weren't offensively doing anything.
[41:59.200 --> 42:03.380]  They're putting real al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia over there and are now talking about
[42:03.380 --> 42:06.960]  our troops having to go in after Assad falls to fight them.
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.000]  I mean, what is going on with Obama openly funding real al-Qaeda?
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.120]  I don't know if you've seen the videos of them chopping Christian's heads off in Syria.
[42:16.120 --> 42:17.680]  I can't even believe this.
[42:17.680 --> 42:24.920]  It's like some outer limits or some other dimension that it's in the news.
[42:24.920 --> 42:27.800]  Obama warns Syria can become enclave from extremism?
[42:27.800 --> 42:33.860]  Why is our government offensively with NATO now saying NATO is over our military?
[42:33.860 --> 42:36.960]  Our military has spoken out against us by the way, I'm sure you know that.
[42:36.960 --> 42:38.960]  What is going on with that?
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.380]  Do you hear anything from your military sources about this craziness, the 10,000 missiles
[42:43.380 --> 42:44.380]  from Benghazi?
[42:44.380 --> 42:46.920]  Why did they kill the ambassador?
[42:46.920 --> 42:47.920]  They stood down.
[42:47.920 --> 42:51.760]  Mayan side sources that are in army intelligence say Obama wanted him dead.
[42:51.760 --> 43:00.080]  It was the Benghazi security force that was al-Qaeda that came over and killed him.
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.120]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[43:03.120 --> 43:08.160]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[43:08.160 --> 43:14.200]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[43:14.200 --> 43:15.200]  to the global takeover.
[43:15.200 --> 43:21.160]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com.
[43:21.160 --> 43:24.800]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.
[43:24.800 --> 43:29.840]  We've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[43:29.840 --> 43:34.680]  The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[43:34.680 --> 43:35.680]  in the field.

[47:04.880 --> 47:34.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.680]  I mean, boy, where do you begin to answer that question?
[47:38.680 --> 47:43.800]  Here's a guy that was born to communists, raised by communists, educated by communists,
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.560]  preached to by America-hating communists.
[47:46.560 --> 47:53.960]  I mean, who hasn't studied where this acorn Chicago gangster scammer came from?
[47:53.960 --> 47:59.800]  But that's what I was talking about, the Department of Homeland Security, which, by the way, Alex,
[47:59.800 --> 48:04.840]  you're on the phone with desire of Homeland Security, my homeland is secure.
[48:04.840 --> 48:06.480]  You know that.
[48:06.480 --> 48:15.080]  But the domestic agencies from the IRS to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to the Bureau of
[48:15.080 --> 48:23.200]  Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and DEA and ATF and FBI and remember, a lot of those
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.160]  people, I still think the majority of those agents are great patriots and great men and
[48:28.160 --> 48:29.160]  women.
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.600]  And I hang the future of America on the nail of truth that they have expressed to me that
[48:34.600 --> 48:40.240]  they will not enforce illegal anti-constitutional orders from above.
[48:40.240 --> 48:41.560]  That is the great hope.
[48:41.560 --> 48:49.640]  But that they're purchasing all this firepower and armored vehicles, who doesn't know this?
[48:49.640 --> 48:56.960]  Who doesn't identify this as an illegal act by the government who is so corrupt, so out
[48:56.960 --> 48:57.960]  of control?
[48:57.960 --> 49:05.480]  And thank God for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Ron Paul and Governor Perry and Greg Abbott
[49:05.480 --> 49:13.680]  and Steve Stockman and Bill Flores and so many patriots that are standing up, but that's
[49:13.680 --> 49:21.400]  the new GOP that we the people have prodded with the we the people pulse.
[49:21.400 --> 49:27.000]  When you extract the we the people pulse from politics, you will get we the people.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.840]  I give you Barack Hussein Obama.
[49:31.840 --> 49:34.600]  I think they're gearing up.
[49:34.600 --> 49:35.880]  What do you think is going on with the bullets?
[49:35.880 --> 49:38.640]  Are they trying to just dry up the bullet supply?
[49:38.640 --> 49:40.760]  Well, they certainly have succeeded.
[49:40.760 --> 49:44.920]  I started my own Ted Nugent line of ammo here last year, and it's like everything else you
[49:44.920 --> 49:49.000]  find on the shelf nowadays, if you can find any, it's state of the art stuff.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.600]  But we literally can't get my pallets of ammo off the truck.
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.160]  People are buying them in the parking lot before they even get to the shelves, which
[49:56.160 --> 50:01.920]  you know, on a consumer side, I'm gleeful of in the ammo industry, the firearms industry
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.440]  is literally having a consumer orgy like never before, which is a very powerful statement
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.320]  from we the people that we smell what you're doing, Obama, and we're gearing up too.
[50:12.320 --> 50:17.280]  And a little don't tread on me reminder seems to be appropriate right now.
[50:17.280 --> 50:23.120]  So there's no question what's going on, the deceit, the scam, the criminality, the Benghazi,
[50:23.120 --> 50:27.600]  the Fast and Furious, sending F-16s to Egypt.
[50:27.600 --> 50:29.440]  I mean, you've got to be kidding me.
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.720]  This would make a stupid birds movie that Alfred Hitchcock wouldn't produce because
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.480]  it's too stupid, but it's actually happening.
[50:38.480 --> 50:40.000]  But that's what frustrates me.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  That's why I got so sick.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  I'm going to be honest.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.880]  I came in last night from work, you know, being an evil American, I got home about nine
[50:46.880 --> 50:49.340]  and she said, what is wrong with you?
[50:49.340 --> 50:54.520]  And I just my kids all came up and they were around me and 10 down to age five and what's
[50:54.520 --> 50:55.840]  wrong, dad?
[50:55.840 --> 50:57.220]  And I just said, I don't want to talk about it.
[50:57.220 --> 51:01.160]  And then I couldn't I got so it was it was past anger.
[51:01.160 --> 51:07.860]  It was the shame that we allow this scum to walk all over us and that and that this country
[51:07.860 --> 51:13.200]  has allowed pathetic filth and authoritarians even call themselves liberal.
[51:13.200 --> 51:14.400]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[51:14.400 --> 51:15.400]  They're not liberals.
[51:15.400 --> 51:21.540]  And it just made me reaffirm that I am going to redouble one hundred and ten percent.
[51:21.540 --> 51:23.360]  And I'm coming after these people.
[51:23.360 --> 51:30.320]  Now, what do you think about ways to go after legally and lawfully to go after Kerry and
[51:30.320 --> 51:31.320]  all these globalists?
[51:31.320 --> 51:33.680]  How do we really get aggressive boycott?
[51:33.680 --> 51:34.680]  What do we do?
[51:34.680 --> 51:41.480]  Well, you know, I have such a if you can bear with me, I literally have the answer, the
[51:41.480 --> 51:42.480]  perfect answer.
[51:42.480 --> 51:47.920]  Ted Cruz didn't sprout out of the ground and just show up.
[51:47.920 --> 51:52.360]  I communicated with Texas, who cared, communicated with them, with them.
[51:52.360 --> 51:53.360]  We enthused him.
[51:53.360 --> 51:54.360]  We supported him.
[51:54.360 --> 51:55.360]  Now he represents us.
[51:55.360 --> 52:02.920]  And did you see the beauty, the perfection of we, the people when Ted Cruz tried?
[52:02.920 --> 52:03.920]  We backed him.
[52:03.920 --> 52:04.920]  We backed him.
[52:04.920 --> 52:05.920]  So we take over.
[52:05.920 --> 52:10.860]  And that's what even the Republican establishment is scared of real constitutional libertarian
[52:10.860 --> 52:12.640]  campaign for liberty people.
[52:12.640 --> 52:13.640]  Absolutely.
[52:13.640 --> 52:21.040]  But that's why Ted Cruz so riled up because he represented the common sense pulse of logic,
[52:21.040 --> 52:22.040]  freedom loving Americans.
[52:22.040 --> 52:24.040]  And every state needs to do that.
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.120]  And there's a lot of states that do do that.
[52:26.120 --> 52:32.360]  Arizona, South Dakota, certainly Texas is the master of it.
[52:32.360 --> 52:36.280]  Wisconsin has done great things with what they've done with Scott Walker up there.
[52:36.280 --> 52:41.080]  And in his own way, even though Christie's only a solid two on the scale of 10, he sure
[52:41.080 --> 52:45.240]  beats the negative eight of the past governors of that state in New Jersey.
[52:45.240 --> 52:52.560]  But we the people, where we don't demand representation based on the Constitution and our common sense,
[52:52.560 --> 52:57.120]  where we don't demand it, we will get the Pelosi's and the Feinstein's and the Bloomberg's
[52:57.120 --> 53:02.000]  and the Cuomo's and the subhuman freedom haters that are infesting this corrupt government
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  right now.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.120]  So the answer is activism, activism, activism.
[53:06.120 --> 53:07.120]  Always polite.
[53:07.120 --> 53:08.120]  Exactly.
[53:08.120 --> 53:09.120]  Always firm.
[53:09.120 --> 53:10.120]  But never, ever give up.
[53:10.120 --> 53:14.120]  Well, here's an example, DrudgeReport.com in the last year has been taking our stories
[53:14.120 --> 53:19.120]  and putting them out about the billion bullets, the 1.6, the 2 billion, the armored vehicles.
[53:19.120 --> 53:23.280]  And they just said it didn't exist, Politico and other White House fronts.
[53:23.280 --> 53:26.280]  Now there's a 15 member congressional investigation starting.
[53:26.280 --> 53:30.720]  Congressman, it's my duty to get to the bottom of massive DHS ammo buy.
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.820]  It's now on Fox, CNN, everywhere.
[53:32.820 --> 53:34.480]  They're being caught lying.
[53:34.480 --> 53:37.400]  And there's an example of just taking action.
[53:37.400 --> 53:41.440]  And the people talking to their Congress folks, we're now forcing this issue out.
[53:41.440 --> 53:44.320]  And we can do that everywhere when we just move against them.
[53:44.320 --> 53:46.800]  The deeper you get into this fight, it is not work, folks.
[53:46.800 --> 53:51.080]  My problem is I am completely obsessed with it because I'm being assaulted.
[53:51.080 --> 53:52.080]  I'm angry.
[53:52.080 --> 53:56.400]  And I have an instinct to, it's like a fight, if somebody starts a fight, starts kicking
[53:56.400 --> 53:57.400]  your butt.
[53:57.400 --> 54:00.440]  When you start kicking their butt back, you wanna go ahead and put them all the way down
[54:00.440 --> 54:01.720]  so they don't get back up.
[54:01.720 --> 54:05.240]  I wanna really get on the offense and really go after them.
[54:05.240 --> 54:11.400]  And if everybody would join state and national gun groups like the NRA and others, if everybody
[54:11.400 --> 54:15.160]  would go to their state houses and get aggressive, we would route these people.
[54:15.160 --> 54:20.240]  In fact, Ted Nugent in closing, you're talking about winning and also having fun.
[54:20.240 --> 54:23.340]  Don't you think that they've jumped the shark here?
[54:23.340 --> 54:27.740]  And that if we double down, we can actually have an offense that could really once and
[54:27.740 --> 54:29.080]  for all defeat the collectivist?
[54:29.080 --> 54:34.520]  Yeah, it almost took, in fact, not almost, it has taken this extreme attack on our individual
[54:34.520 --> 54:39.520]  freedoms by Barack Obama and all his gangster punk friends out there to wake a lot of Americans
[54:39.520 --> 54:43.880]  up buying more firearms, more ammo than ever in recorded history of planet Earth.
[54:43.880 --> 54:44.880]  That's a great sign.
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.440]  But don't underestimate the importance, I use the term cleanse my soul, Alex.
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.040]  I get up in the tree with my bow and arrow, I train with these heroes of the military
[54:53.040 --> 54:57.560]  that have sacrificed their arms and their legs and we shoot machine guns from helicopters
[54:57.560 --> 55:02.840]  and kill hogs and we barbecue and we fish, so never underestimate the importance of getting
[55:02.840 --> 55:06.320]  away from the battle as long as you've done the battle to the best of your ability and
[55:06.320 --> 55:09.920]  signed up new members of the NRA, Gun Owners of America, you've communicated with your
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.400]  elected officials and you've kind of educated slash chastised your friends who are not engaged.
[55:15.400 --> 55:19.600]  But then get out with your family, invite some new shooters, take that.22 with ears
[55:19.600 --> 55:23.840]  and eyes and hearing protection and eye protection and introduce some new shooters.
[55:23.840 --> 55:29.600]  I've attended camp for kids charity for 25 years and we've graduated over 15,000 young
[55:29.600 --> 55:35.040]  Americans into the shooting sports for safe proper gun handling that drives the enemy
[55:35.040 --> 55:36.040]  berserk.
[55:36.040 --> 55:42.000]  That's how you blend your soul while you're winning the war, having the time of your life.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.600]  Now you're right, we all need to fight hard and then play hard.
[55:45.600 --> 55:52.160]  The Black Power Tour in closing, tell us about that, that really upset the system that your
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.200]  inspiration was black rock and rollers.
[55:54.200 --> 55:57.800]  It also upsets them that Charlton Heston was such a humanitarian in the civil rights movement.
[55:57.800 --> 56:02.560]  Well, all the good music in the world comes from black artists, from the Howlin' Wolf
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.080]  and Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry and Little Richard and James Brown and
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.920]  Wilson Pickett and Sam and Dave and the Motown Funk Brothers.
[56:08.920 --> 56:14.040]  So my incredible band, the greatest rock and roll rhythm and blues band in the world, Greg
[56:14.040 --> 56:17.440]  Smith and Mick Brown and Derek St. Holmes, we're hitting the road this year starting
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.000]  next month with REO and Stix and we're going out all summer before the hunting season starts.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.560]  But we're going to play a tribute, as we always have for 50 years, to those black American
[56:26.560 --> 56:30.520]  heroes that have inspired every piece of killer music in the history of mankind.
[56:30.520 --> 56:36.240]  And it's called Black Power because the black artists showed us the way musically and emotionally
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.840]  and that spirit and the uppity ferocity, so we should take that and use it.
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.920]  You can use Stranglehold as the ultimate soundtrack for freedom and defiance.
[56:45.920 --> 56:49.560]  And I want to thank everybody for making our Spirit of the Wild show the number one show
[56:49.560 --> 56:54.160]  on Outdoor Channel and our Wanted Ted or Alive show the number one show on Sportsman Channel.
[56:54.160 --> 56:58.360]  But I'm keeping at it, I'm turning up the heat, and we need to get more aggressive and
[56:58.360 --> 57:00.720]  we need to win this culture war ASAP.
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.160]  Well look at how all these hit shows on Discovery, they're trying to cancel them, even though
[57:05.160 --> 57:09.240]  they're hits because they know we're winning the culture war, I see this whole attack as
[57:09.240 --> 57:10.240]  desperate flailing.
[57:10.240 --> 57:13.520]  It is desperate flailing, but that's going to backfire on them.
[57:13.520 --> 57:17.520]  Jim Carrey's going to backfire, Michael Moore's backfiring, I believe Nancy you don't need
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.120]  to read this, you need to sign it, Pelosi is a backfire in itself.
[57:22.120 --> 57:27.120]  So we need to take advantage of the indecency, the heat from the other side.
[57:27.120 --> 57:31.680]  We need to express it, always express it calmly, if you're going to call your senator, have
[57:31.680 --> 57:35.600]  a piece of paper with the main two points you want to make.
[57:35.600 --> 57:40.280]  Absolutely, TedNugent.com, Ted, thank you for giving such an eloquent defense of Charlton
[57:40.280 --> 57:43.800]  Heston, not that he needed it, you're right, but God bless you and we'll talk to you again
[57:43.800 --> 57:44.800]  very soon, folks, Ted Nugent.
[57:44.800 --> 57:45.800]  Godspeed, Alex.
[57:45.800 --> 57:50.680]  You too, goodbye, we'll be right back, stay with us, that was Ted Nugent.
[57:50.680 --> 57:55.060]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights
[57:55.060 --> 57:57.360]  and jogging, but nothing was working.
[57:57.360 --> 58:02.120]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins
[58:02.120 --> 58:07.720]  and as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[58:07.720 --> 58:08.720]  be satisfied.
[58:08.720 --> 58:13.000]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out
[58:13.000 --> 58:20.680]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[58:20.680 --> 58:24.840]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[58:24.840 --> 58:28.600]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[58:28.600 --> 58:32.480]  than 37 pounds in just two months, now that's results.
[58:32.480 --> 58:38.200]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of
[58:38.200 --> 58:43.680]  their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite

[59:51.520 --> 01:00:00.520]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:13.920]  Well, I tell you, that last hour was the opposite of blood pumping nuclear powered brain damage.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:21.280]  That was blood pumping nuclear powered liberty with the crazed rocker and defender of the
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.680]  second amendment, the liberty teeth, good old Ted Nugent.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.200]  Now, I will be back live next week on the Sunday show and throughout the week, but I
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.960]  mean, it is Easter and the crew is pointing out, you know, it is Easter and that little
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.880]  bunny rabbit hops around laying eggs, so can we have off?
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.160]  And so yes, this is a retransmission obviously.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.280]  Coming up, Larry Elder, a lot of you missed this interview, very powerful dealing with
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.480]  how they try to create racial division, and John Rappaport, how they're now drugging people
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.560]  with mind control drugs that get them ready to quote, tell the truth in trial.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:59.560]  So maybe we'll just waterboard you now up during the trial and the prosecutor will be
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.920]  the one who actually waterboards you.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.240]  We'll go back to the Spanish inquisition, dun, dun, dun, that's a Monty Python illusion,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.800]  but it was actually a very serious thing.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.880]  And then maybe they'll just waterboard you, but they used to waterboard you down to the
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.220]  bottom of the castle, down to the dungeon, and they kind of walk you back up to the top
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.680]  and then you would say that you were guilty of everything.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.000]  So let's just dispense with all the waterboarding now, I love world government, it's very reasonable
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.720]  and even though they admit Aspartame gives you diabetes and kills you, I love Bill Gates
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.400]  and think he's a good person and everybody should drink more Aspartame.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.860]  I'm no longer a conspiracy theorist, I embrace total tyranny and simultaneously say it doesn't
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.640]  exist with Crimestop 1984.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.800]  Okay, to come up in a minute is a little piece I did a few years ago, but it hadn't gotten
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.160]  the traffic it deserves.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:49.440]  It's the two-party dictatorship, two minutes long, very, very powerful, and so I hope that
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.000]  all of you get this information out to people who are in the two-party system.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.520]  Lastly, this is the last day, but they may extend it into tomorrow, just get your call

[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:45.760]  it's really great to get, so get those while you're at it, 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.120]  forward slash Alex.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:54.320]  Here it is on Easter, the left-right paradigm, explain, the two-party dictatorship, explain.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:01.520]  I wanted to draw a picture that describes effectively the false left-right paradigm.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.320]  The Republican Party props up the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party props up the
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.880]  Republican Party.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:13.760]  By itself, a single-party system will fall over, but if you take the two-party systems
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:20.760]  and you lean them up against each other, this is basically the arch, their force going together,
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:28.040]  keeps them together and makes it become a very strong, stable platform on which they
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.720]  can build their hierarchical new world order system.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.600]  So the current two-party system has been dominated and bought up and controlled by the elite
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  that sits atop it.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.760]  Now, the elite with a one-party system would not be balanced on top of one party, they
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:47.760]  would be subject to being toppled, but you put the two parties up against each other,
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.520]  they form a royal arch, and now it's very hard to separate those two because they're
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.600]  leaning up against each other.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:01.000]  And so Republicans attack Barack Obama, and then the Democrats attack John McCain, and
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.760]  then the population who's down here is trained to see John McCain as representing them personally,
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.200]  as being their daddy, of where their personal power comes from, of their camp, their brand
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.000]  name, their brand of soda, and so this is a controlled paradigm.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.320]  And really it's one unit supporting themselves and containing revolution, so that the people
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:28.880]  who were down here never learned that there is a world outside of this controlled paradigm.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.860]  We are locked within the left-right paradigm, and then it becomes this huge pageant, this
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:40.720]  huge distraction where we analyze every facet of the two political parties, never realizing
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.200]  they themselves are simply a front or puppets for a larger power structure.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:52.200]  And then they can limit the scope of differences, which if you look at it, there's almost no
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.560]  difference between the two, instead of getting the people to look outside the box at the
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.760]  wider world.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:05.240]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.320]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.040]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons, but how will these items
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.280]  help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.280]  Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:28.280]  Supernatural Silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria,
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.720]  viruses, moles, and fungus, and is remarkable for wound care.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:38.880]  Taken internally or used topically, it can help keep you safe from deadly pathogens.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.640]  Supernatural Silver has over 500 different uses and a long-term shelf life, making it
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.840]  the number one choice of preppers across the country.

[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:08.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:38.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 AM until 2 PM Central Standard Time, we are here live.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.200]  We've had Larry Elder scheduled, we're trying to connect with him on Skype, we'll see if
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.200]  that happens.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.800]  Very interesting individual, of course, radio host there in Los Angeles, and his views on
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.560]  Obama and where all this is going.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.720]  But I'll tell you this, the power structure is pulling out all the stops now to just confuse
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.380]  reality.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:01.200]  And our answer is to get real, to get serious, and go all the way.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.120]  And by going all the way, we've gotten in this position because the establishment says
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.800]  be mealy-mouthed, don't be aggressive, compromise, that's how you're successful.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.280]  And during the sellout of America, some people could be successful for a time doing that.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.960]  But now we're getting down to the end game, folks.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:24.560]  You've got to realize this is a very bad place we're going to, and you cannot imagine that
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.560]  you're part of the power structure.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:35.640]  You cannot imagine that and get out of all this because you're not part of the power
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]  structure.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.800]  I mean, look at this, citizens tell gun grabbers you are coloring outside the lines of constitutional
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.280]  parameters.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.120]  They're suing New York that they can't bar the Second Amendment.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:50.320]  So you get back on the offensive.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.480]  Now 15 members of Congress are saying we want to see why you're buying thousands of armored
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.200]  vehicles and billions of bullets.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.600]  It's happening.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.120]  Fast and Furious is getting back out there.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.800]  And again, we're in deep trouble because both political parties to a great extent are bought
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.320]  and paid for by crony capitalist interests that want to use socialism at the grassroots
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:16.020]  to control us and crony capitalism on the top of the system to absolutely, totally,
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.120]  and completely get everybody domesticated.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.000]  And I just don't want to live under this.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  Very exciting.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  I've never had this guy on.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  Or maybe I did many years ago.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  It seems I did.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  You know, it all blurs together.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.480]  We're doing radio six days a week.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.560]  But he, of course, is one of the most popular talk show hosts out in California.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.600]  And I'm thinking sometimes he's been syndicated again.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.600]  I don't have time to follow a lot of media outside of what we do and what the establishment
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.600]  throws at us.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.760]  But he's hosted Larry Elder's show for more than 15 years.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.760]  That's right.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760]  Nationally syndicated.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.600]  And every time I see clips of him, it's always just extremely informative.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.440]  And he's been on everything from Oprah to you name it, Larry Elder dot com.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.640]  And I'm very, very excited to have him on the broadcast with us to talk about the state
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.200]  of the world and how crazy everything's gotten and what he expects the collectivist to do.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.920]  I see him trying to play us off against each other as much as they can desperately so that
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.120]  we don't get together and unify around the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.960]  Larry, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.960]  Thanks for spending time.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.960]  It's an honor.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960]  It's an honor to have you.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:25.720]  Well, so much so much is going on out there in the world.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.480]  What is front and center on your radar screen?
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.840]  Well, Alex, as I was trying to tell Mr. Piss Morgan when I was on there a couple of weeks
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.600]  ago, if you really want to talk about gun violence in America, the face of gun violence
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.560]  as horrific as Sandy Hook was, it's not the face of some suburban kid.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.080]  A kid is more likely to be struck by lightning, Alex, and to be killed in the school shooting.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.440]  The face of gun violence in this country is a 15-year-old girl who performed at Obama's
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.280]  inauguration who was killed by one of those to whom it made concerned gang-related bullets.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.240]  It's a six-year-old Latina girl who was sitting on her porch one night in March last year,
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.840]  Alex, one of five people to be killed in that hour in Chicago.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.280]  Chicago is a city right now which is on track for two Sandy Hooks per month.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.440]  If you look at the demographics of Chicago, the city is roughly a third black, a third
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.440]  white, and a third Hispanic.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.720]  However, the homicides, 70% of them are committed by black people and usually the victim is
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.280]  almost always another black person.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]  Take New York.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:26.400]  New York is demographically about 46% or so white, about 17 to 20% Hispanic, about that
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.400]  same number of blacks.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.280]  However, according to Police Commissioner Kelly, 96% of the homicides are committed
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.600]  by black and brown people, almost always, Alex, the victim is another black or brown
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.600]  person.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.680]  Now, the question is why this is going on.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.400]  We have a couple of possible suspects.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.400]  One is racism.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.120]  The problem with that is during Jim Crow, when we had not only de facto segregation,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.000]  we had legal segregation, you didn't find this kind of criminality coming from the black
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  community.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  What about racism?
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.880]  During the Great Depression, 50% of the black adults were unemployed, 50%.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.280]  You did not find this kind of criminality, 70% today of black kids are born outside of
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280]  wedlock.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.920]  That is triple the number back in 1965.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.640]  Today, 50% of Hispanic kids are born outside of wedlock, about 35% of white kids.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.040]  Now, I mention that because it's a direct relationship between not having a father in
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.120]  the house and fill in the blank of your favorite social ill, whether it's dropouts, whether
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.960]  it's unemployment, whether it's, yes, gun homicide, a direct relationship between not
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.680]  having a father in the house and bad behavior.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.800]  And we've incentivized people into having children without getting married because we've
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.160]  given people money after the so-called War on Poverty was launched.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.640]  Lyndon Johnson and Alex literally sent poverty workers going door to door in inner city households,
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.520]  letting women know of their so-called rights to welfare, provided there was no man in the
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.520]  house.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.860]  So from 1965, the percentage of black kids born outside of wedlock has tripled as we
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.520]  spent $16 trillion on so-called poverty programs.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.400]  We've incentivized people into making bad decisions.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.320]  We've allowed women to get food stamps, AFDC, you name it, a woman with two children living
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.800]  on welfare is making more money than she would if he had a minimum wage job, and we've allowed
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.320]  the man to abandon his financial and moral responsibility.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.840]  Bill Cosby calls such men unwed fathers.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.680]  That's what we've done for the last 50 years.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.560]  And the left can't come to the conclusion, my Lord, what have I done?
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.480]  So they got to blame racism, sexism, and yes, high capacity magazines.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.600]  Well, absolutely.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.000]  I saw you as one of our reporters who interviewed a few weeks ago, David Ortiz, and that's why
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.040]  I wanted, Ortiz wanted to get you on to expand on all of this because it's so crazy that
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.840]  now you say, I don't want socialist healthcare, racist.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.320]  I don't want to have all of this corporate welfare racist.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.880]  I want my second amendment and then the Fox columnist and others say, well, that's racist.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.920]  And I go, explain to me how it's racist and they go, I'm not going to, I'm going to throw
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.680]  that out to distract the whole debate.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.320]  And then I go back to Margaret Sanger who said, look at these black communities, they're
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.640]  becoming wealthy, they're self-sufficient.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.720]  We're not going to integrate to bring real equality, we're going to integrate so we can
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.200]  get rid of these weeds.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.000]  We've got to oppose as liberals.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Are you familiar?
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.400]  I mean, you're pretty smart and obviously informed guy, but most people aren't that
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.780]  I talked to of her writings and stuff and that I don't think the left actually did this
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.780]  on accident.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:15.080]  A lot of bleeding hearts actually think it's good and actually want to help people.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.040]  But the higher ups, I mean, the democratic party was the Ku Klux Klan party, but when
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.280]  they couldn't suppress blacks anymore of the 20s and 30s, they became the Democrats.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.120]  The history of the democratic party has been completely skanky.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.160]  Members of the democratic party formed the Klan.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.600]  The Klan used to be called the terror wing of the democratic party, and you're right
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.600]  about Margaret Sanger.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.080]  She was a proponent of eugenics.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:41.000]  She believed that people were socially undesirable and they were usually poor, young black women.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.920]  And I've written a book about this called Dear Father, Dear Son, Two Lives, Eight Hours
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.600]  where I talk about the importance of fathers, and one of the things I try and do, Alex,
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.520]  is use sources that people can't impeach.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.340]  I could use the Heritage Foundation, they've done all sorts of studies showing the lack
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.600]  of fathers and all the social ill that I mentioned.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.240]  Charles Murray wrote a wonderful book called Losing Ground, arguably the most important
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.120]  book about the devastation to the nuclear intact family by the welfare state that's
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.360]  been written the last 50 years.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.560]  So I use people like that well-known neo-Khan Tupac Shakur.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.720]  After he died, Alex, there was a documentary that came out called Resurrection, and in
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.960]  the documentary, he said, I know for a fact if I had had a father in my life, I would
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.720]  have had some discipline and I would have been more confident.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.880]  A man needs to be raised by a man, and then he proceeded to explain why he joined gangs.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.680]  He wanted protection, he wanted structure, and he wanted values.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.120]  He's saying this, I'm not saying this, this is Tupac Shakur, and the only times had
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.600]  a poll back in the 80s, and they asked poor people and non-poor people the following question.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.920]  Do you believe that young, poor women often have children to get additional welfare benefits?
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.360]  The majority of non-poor people said no.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.480]  However, when poor people were asked the same question, do you believe that young, poor
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.080]  women often have children to get additional benefits, 64% said yes.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080]  So they're telling us we're just not listening.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.560]  And one time I had on my show one of these so-called black leaders, Kwasi Mfume, I haven't
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.600]  been able to get Jackson or Farah Khan or Sharpton on my show in 20 years, but Kwasi
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.440]  Mfume, when he was in the head of the NAACP came on, and to his credit, I asked him the
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.760]  following question, Mr. Mfume, as between the presence of white racism, which you often
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.400]  talk about, or the absence of black fathers, which in my opinion, you don't talk about
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.480]  enough, which poses a bigger threat to the black community.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.200]  And without missing a beat, he said, the absence of fathers.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:31.600]  So they're telling us we're just not listening.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.320]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:14.320]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.200]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.200]  What do you mean biblical?
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.720]  What do you mean this Old Testament, Mr. Mayor?
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.520]  Real wrath of God type stuff, fire and brimstone coming down from the skies, rivers and seas
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.120]  boiling, 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave,
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.600]  human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.920]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.320]  the mind of man.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:21:01.720]  Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.240]  Tell us some about your books because this is something that can be used, you know, the
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.800]  knowledge you're laying out to empower people, and I think I'm going to read them other people
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.800]  should as well.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.400]  Well, Alex, my book, Dear Father, Dear Son, is about my relationship with my own father,
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400]  which was not good.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.680]  My father was what I call a junkyard dog dad.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.080]  He was a Montford Point Marine.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.680]  They were the equivalent of the Tuskegee Airmen.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680]  He was the first black Marine.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.040]  There were 20,000 of them that trained in North Carolina, so a rough, tough guy, and
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.040]  I misunderstood his tough exterior for lack of love.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.400]  He beat us with a belt, with a telephone cord, not uncommon the way people were punished
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.720]  in those days, especially if the adult came from the South.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.760]  But I just mistook that for lack of love, so when I'm 15 years old, my dad and I have
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.840]  this furious fight, and we don't speak for 10 years.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.040]  And finally, I'm 25 years old, we sit down and we speak.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.300]  I figured the conversation would last 10 minutes.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.940]  It lasted eight hours, and during that period of time, I found out that the name Elder,
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:55.240]  my last name, is the name of the boyfriend who was in his life the longest.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240]  He never married his mother.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.160]  He was an alcoholic who beat my father and his mother.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.300]  My dad comes home from school, has a fight with the mother's then boyfriend, a different
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.480]  man than Elder.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.680]  The mother sides with the boyfriend.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.880]  My dad is thrown out of the house, never to return.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:11.440]  We're talking about a black kid, Jim Crow's spouse, age of 13, a year or two before the
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.120]  beginning of the Great Depression, Athens, Georgia.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.800]  And my dad never returned home, and despite all of his troubles, my dad always told my
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.800]  brothers and me this, hard work wins, you get out of life what you put into it, no matter
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.240]  how hard you work, bad things are going to happen, and how you respond to those bad things
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.040]  will tell me whether or not your mother and I raised a man.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.320]  And I would always say, not too much pressure, Dad.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.800]  My point is this, he was around, he was a rough, tough, imperfect father, but he was
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.800]  around.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800]  And by word and by deed-
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800]  Exactly.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.800]  He taught me what it's like to be a dad.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.120]  Well, they say a dad's gotta be perfect, and you know what, your dad gets scared, you're
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.400]  not doing what you're supposed to do, you're not listening, you're out of control.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.560]  I'll tell you, it's better to have brutal discipline than no discipline at all.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.080]  These kids are a wreck, so they end up in prison, they end up dead, and it's because
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.520]  they've destroyed fathers in America that now what happened to the black community has
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.120]  been done everywhere else, and it is destroying our civilization.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.280]  And Alex, the key is hard work.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.720]  The formula is very simple.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.880]  Graduate from high school, don't have a kid before you're 20 years old, and get married
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.880]  before you have the kid.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.040]  James Q. Wilson said, anybody who follows that formula will not be poor.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:20.240]  If you fail to follow that formula, there's a good chance you are going to be poor.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.320]  So the question is, what are we doing to incentivize, or perhaps more importantly, what are we doing
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.480]  to de-incentivize people into following that formula?
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.960]  That's what's going on here.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.680]  And we know what works, Alex, because in 1996, Bill Clinton reluctantly signed the Welfare
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.680]  Reform Act.
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.680]  What happened?
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.720]  Welfare rolls declined by over 50%.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:39.200]  So we know that a bunch of able-bodied and able-minded people were on the couch, they
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.120]  got off after they realized the jig was up.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.600]  We need to continue that, and welfare needs to be done at the state and local level.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.680]  The federal government needs to get out of it altogether, and we need to encourage the
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.080]  so-called thousand points of life.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:52.600]  There are a whole bunch of people in the community doing stuff, big brothers, big sisters.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.720]  I belong to an organization called, a place called Home, where I contribute money to an
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:01.040]  organization that teaches people on computers, and that's a chance to do in the short run,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.200]  because there aren't fathers here.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.880]  You have to incentivize people to get into their communities, and to be mentors for these
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:11.680]  young people, until we turn out the culture, which is changing policies, and letting people
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.240]  know it is not a good idea to be an unwed father.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.040]  That's an expression that Bill Cosby has been using, my mother and my dad have been using
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040]  it.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.200]  Oh yeah, people think it's so cool to go get young women pregnant, and then just turn your
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.240]  kids loose to be destroyed.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.360]  There's nothing more punkish than that.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.520]  And you know, when I mentioned Kwesi and Fume, this is a guy who turned his life around,
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520]  Alex.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.100]  This is a guy who had four or five kids by four or five different women, and then turned
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:38.920]  his life around, and has been dedicating himself to trying to improve things in the black community.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.480]  The thing that really bothers me about some of these so-called black leaders, whether
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.860]  it's Farrakhan, Jackson, or Sharpton, they all should know something about the importance
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:51.800]  of fathers, because in their own lives, their fathers were either absent or bad dads.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.600]  Jackson's father was a married man who lived next door to his teenage mother, got her pregnant.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.080]  Jackson grew up in South Carolina with taunts, Jesse ain't got no daddy, Jesse ain't got
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.080]  no daddy.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.080]  It bothered him.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.760]  In the case of Sharpton, Sharpton was middle class until his father abandoned the family,
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.760]  then down to the ghetto.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.340]  In the case of Farrakhan, his mother was estranged from her husband, had a boyfriend, took back
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:15.360]  up with the estranged husband, got pregnant, didn't want the boyfriend to know, so she
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.440]  tried to abort Farrakhan with a coat hanger on several occasions.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.800]  Well, that's right, when you cheat on your wife, when you cheat on your wife, folks,
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.960]  you're really cheating on your kids.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.880]  I mean, I mean, that's the bottom line.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.720]  People think it's so cool to cheat, they think it's really sexy, really fun, I'm not judging
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.320]  people that have done it, we're human stuff goes, but the point is, it's certainly not
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.600]  something to be proud of.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.800]  The, the, one of the greatest expressions I've ever heard about this, Alex, is the best
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.120]  thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.040]  Because when these kids get into the streets, Alex, with no father, they're thin skinned,
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.280]  they're angry, they resent adults, they have no idea on how to resolve disputes in an intelligent
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.520]  way without profanity and without violence.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.920]  That's one of the many things you see when you have an adult relationship in your house
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.920]  with your mother and your father.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.480]  You're watching adults resolve disputes, you're watching a guy get up and go to work when
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.240]  he doesn't feel like it, that's what you don't see, hard work wins, and we're discouraging
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:11.200]  that with our welfare state and by incentivizing people into making bad moral decisions.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:17.400]  Now, it was, who was the football coach that said, winners never quit and quitters never
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.400]  win?
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.280]  Sounds like something Lombardi would say.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.480]  That's who said it, yeah.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.400]  It's so true though, I mean, I go down to demonstrations and things and we'll have communists
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.880]  and socialists down there and I'll walk up and they'll go, oh, look, it's a capitalist.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:36.600]  And I look at them and I'm like, look, I mean, you really think communism is better than
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:41.200]  what a free market and freedom creates?
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.320]  I said, look at what communism does and they just laugh.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.440]  I mean, they really think that when they collapse America into communism, they're gonna have
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  some great time.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.360]  I mean, they're just idiots, they're just idiots, they're just morons, they have no
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.360]  idea what they're doing.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.560]  Well, you know, in 1900 at all three levels, Alex, government took about 7% of the nation's
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.560]  income.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.280]  Right now, when you put a monetary value on so-called unfunded mandates, we're talking
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.920]  about federal, state, and local taking over 40% of the people's income.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.360]  One of the reasons America has been so great is that we trusted our people with our own
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.640]  money and with our own time.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640]  We no longer do that.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.960]  We've got a president who's now added a fourth leg to our welfare state.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.440]  We've got social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and now Obamacare.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.440]  Until and unless we reverse that, we're gonna still under-produce.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.360]  2% sucks as GDP.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.040]  We should be rocket enrolling at 4% and 4% and 5%.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.760]  We should be creating 3, 4, and 500,000 jobs per month, the way we did at this juncture
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.760]  during the Ronald Reagan recovery.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.000]  This is the worst recovery since the Great Depression.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.320]  It's because of these policies.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]  Well, it's not a recovery.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.880]  I mean, that's even a hoax.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.080]  Well, even, yeah, you're right, that last quarter we had negative growth, although they
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.480]  revised it up a little bit.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.760]  This is just awful, and you look at the percentage of people, able-bodied people, who've just
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.200]  given up the labor force participation rate is what we ought to be looking at.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.120]  Well, I think a lot of, I know a lot of hardworking people that are giving up because they're
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.800]  sick of watching lazy people sit around and live off them, but then that's what happens
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.080]  in any socialist society.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.640]  Finally, the people working three jobs give up, and man, then things really get bad.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.300]  Well, that's what Mitt Romney was talking about with the 47%.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.300]  People weren't listening.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:16.720]  Once you get to a point where over 50% of the voters are not paying federal income taxes,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.960]  they can march in there and pull the lever for a raise on somebody else's dime, we are
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.600]  in deep, deep- Well, yeah, they spun it that he didn't care
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.040]  about the other percent.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.280]  No, he was saying, they're not listening to me.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.520]  They're on the government payroll.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.580]  They don't care.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.580]  They don't care.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.200]  Well, you mentioned how they spin it, and that really is a deeper problem.
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.200]  When everybody talks to me about the post-mortem, what Mitt Romney could have done and could
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.780]  have done this, could have done that, there's plenty of things he could have done and could
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.800]  have said that might have made him win, but you have to go to the main, what I call the
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.200]  main screen media, Alex.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.880]  All these people, ABC, NBC, CBS, I call it MSNBC, he-haul, virtually every-
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.200]  They all distort everything.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]  Stay there.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.200]  Wow, this is amazing.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.200]  Larry Elder is a really interesting person.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.240]  We've got to have him have him on for a full hour soon.

[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.080]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:12.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:41.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:53.680]  Well, John Rappaport is a graduate of Amherst College, the BA in Philosophy, and has worked
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:57.920]  on a freelance investigative reporter for 30 years, and again, he's worked for some
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.520]  of the largest publications in the country in uninvestigated reporting, the Los Angeles
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.440]  Times, you name it, and of course, he's also done investigations for international and
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.120]  national television programs.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.600]  NoMoreFakeNews.com is his website, and he is a frequent guest to this broadcast.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:25.640]  But I saw the Denver Post and others last week engaged in unbelievable, off-the-chart,
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:31.380]  gigantic mind control operations where they just calmly, and I'll pull up the headlines
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:35.700]  for you in a moment, where they, if you're a TV viewer, I'll give the headlines out to
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.040]  radio listeners so you can search it yourself.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:43.040]  Oh, judge to order homes to take truth serum during trial.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.160]  And they just report it like, oh, that's a good thing, thank God they're doing that.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:50.160]  Folks, that group, that family of drugs is what they use to put you into mind control.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.000]  I mean, that's even in movies like Conspiracy Theory about mind control with Mel Gibson.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.760]  I mean, even in Hollywood movies, people know that.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.520]  Sirhan Sirhan was put on amnesiac drugs.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.520]  That later came out.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.160]  Even the LAPD said that and said he didn't shoot him.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.720]  There have been court cases now proving there was CIA there when RFK got shot.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:14.280]  So this is so crazy that you've got him getting 30 plus thousand dollars, like 27,000 in one
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:20.240]  check and 7,000, 8,000 in another, over 30,000 in DARPA, Department of Defense, Advanced
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:27.800]  Research Laboratories, funding to him in a secret brain program that he'd been in since
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.800]  high school.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.840]  I mean, he was brought in from high school into college programs.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.480]  Who's the smartest do they do that with in the testing?
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:41.860]  And then here he is, been in college for years, everything's paid for with this grant.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.280]  And he's got an Air Force psychologist, psychiatrist, top level over him.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.740]  And then they report multiple smoke bombs and multiple shooters.
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:53.720]  He tells people in the jail, I was drugged, I was under mind control.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.080]  That came out in the local news.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:59.800]  And then they said, no, he wasn't around any prisoners, even though for weeks they'd reported
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.560]  the first few days he was with those prisoners next door to him and now he was hissing and
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.720]  screaming and yelling.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.200]  Now he's off the drugs, says he doesn't remember anything.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.120]  They're keeping him very sequestered and now they wanna drug him again to go back to being
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:18.160]  the personality he was, the personality that thinks he did the shooting or may have done
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.640]  the shooting or taken part in it.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.040]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they could take even a strong willed person like myself, they
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.480]  could take you.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:33.460]  And they can, with shock therapy, LSD, PCP, peyote, halcyon, other amnesics, sodium pentothal,
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:37.000]  they can make you chop your newborn baby up.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.840]  They can make you think you're another person.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.480]  They can make you who have the skills to be an opera singer.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.320]  I mean, they can program you, and again, it's in the MK Ultra, MK Naomi congressional hearings
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.400]  of the 70s.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.140]  This has all come out, okay?
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:53.660]  And I'm ranting, we're gonna go to John Rappaport, who's an expert on this, and he's written
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:57.880]  the article, the CIA, James Holmes, MK Ultra, and truth serum torture.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:02.200]  But here's the psy-op on everybody, they're reporting, they're gonna drug him with mind
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.660]  control drugs, three of them, we're gonna list them here, in public.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:10.360]  So this is the new thing, they're gonna not just drug you till you say you did something
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.440]  in the jail without charging you as they've done in cases.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.800]  Some people in federal prison for ten years before trial, drugging them, saying they're
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.600]  mentally ill, getting them ready for trial.
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.100]  In the case of Dr. Sell, a dentist who they said did Medicare fraud, he fought it so they
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.200]  just grabbed him and drugged him in Kansas City.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.460]  So imagine this, there's so many cases of this now where they're grabbing lawyers that
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:35.280]  sue Williamson County, north of Austin, and so they go arrest the lawyer and commit him
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.280]  for two years.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.680]  I mean, this is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen, and now they're out in the open going, yeah,
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:44.760]  we're now gonna drug Americans for trial with mind control drugs.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.120]  This is now Gitmo going mainstream.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.920]  Now I'm ranting, I wanna go directly to John Rappaport, but it's just like they hide Obama
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.600]  being the head of Al-Qaeda publicly and commanding Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.880]  And so we put the headline out, Obama now global head of Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.480]  That sounds crazy because it is absurdist.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.720]  You've gotta counter absurdist garbage by stating how absurdist it is, not processing
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.520]  it and watering it down.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.820]  Now John, I'm ranting here, but what is your take on this being out in the open?
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820]  What does this signify?
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:21.160]  Are they all gonna start publicly drugging us for trial so we say we did bad things?
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:26.680]  Yeah, this is MK Ultra going mainstream, Alex, this is exactly that.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.920]  This is the old CIA program and the new CIA program.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:36.440]  This is, we're gonna drug you till you say what we want you to say.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.640]  And what most people don't realize about MK Ultra was, it started out one big part of
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.920]  it as we're gonna find a truth drug, you know, this was back in the early 50s, they couldn't
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.920]  find one.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.640]  In other words, these drugs don't work to make you tell the truth.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.540]  What they do is they destroy your mind or they terrify you to the point where you will
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.760]  say what they want you to say.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760]  That's the big difference.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:06.240]  And when they hit on LSD as the drug of choice, that's why they used it.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.380]  It wasn't a truth drug, it didn't make people tell the truth.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:13.720]  You don't download the truth out of somebody's mind with one of these drugs.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.080]  What you do is you either destroy their mind altogether, make them into a complete babbling
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:24.400]  idiot, or you bring them to the point where they're so terrified because of the dosage
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.800]  levels, you say to them, okay, you get the point now, do you want to have this again?
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.640]  Or are you going to tell what we want you to tell?
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.000]  And this is, of course, all science, this is all neurology, this is all psychiatry,
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.320]  this is all the very best of the legal system.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:48.280]  This is the brutal, incredibly torturous, this is torture.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.240]  This is what MK culture was.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:53.320]  And now they're just mainstreaming it right out in the open.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.640]  Here's what's going to happen to James Holmes.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:59.100]  And we're going to call it a narco-analytic review.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:02.400]  So it all sounds very fancy and so forth.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.880]  And I'll tell you one other thing, Alex.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:11.160]  The hacks who are the psychiatrists at the Colorado State Mental System hospitals, they
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.600]  don't know anything about this.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.280]  I mean, they're not the pros or the experts.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:20.920]  They're going to have to bring in pros from the agencies that really know how to work
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:21.920]  these.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:25.360]  Oh, no, they're going to probably bring in his very handlers that ran the operation.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]  Exactly.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.400]  And CIA people will be there.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.320]  The people who have worked on this before.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.740]  No, I'm saying I bet it's going to be, that'll be the prime suspect.
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:40.240]  I bet, look for who actually programmed him to be who the expert they send.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.120]  Listen, McVeigh had Jolyon West, number two under MK Ultra congressional hearings, admittedly
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.160]  one of the fathers of modern mind control, assigned to him for the decade before they
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.800]  executed him weekly from the time he was arrested to executed, Jolyon West was there.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.800]  Exactly.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:00.160]  And then as soon as McVeigh would get off the drugs, he'd tell people, no, I'm special
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.160]  forces.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.160]  They set me up.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:05.320]  And that's exactly what sworn affidavits from three different people say.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.940]  Well, this is the same kind of thing.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:12.920]  You bring in the handler, you bring in the person who is controlling, just like in the
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.300]  CIA, you know, I'm your case officer, so you report back to me.
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:24.140]  So they're going to puff this guy up to the point where he's going to come back into court.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:28.280]  He's going to make some kind of bland statement like, yeah, I know I did it.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.240]  Yes, that's true.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:33.520]  I'm still, I still have problems.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.520]  And then they'll just warehouse this guy for the rest of his life and destroy his mind,
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:42.160]  whether it's in prison or in a psych ward, it doesn't really matter.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.240]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.320]  This is unprecedented, though.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.440]  But the story, this is the cherry on top where they lied and said he was never around other
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.920]  inmates when the inmates said multiple ones.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920]  Yeah.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.920]  He said he was under mind control.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]  That came out in the Denver papers.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:58.920]  They went, oh, no, he was never around people, even though they'd all admitted he had been.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.760]  The fact that they're covering up the notebook, the fact that he's got this high level top
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.640]  Air Force psychiatrist over him.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:06.160]  He's in a DARPA program.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.760]  I mean, how transparent does this have to be?
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.040]  And now they're going to drug him with a mind, with several mind control drugs to make him
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.040]  tell the truth.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:19.080]  I mean, this is like total mainlining of this.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.080]  Absolutely.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.680]  And of course, when he was arrested, you know, first you had the story that he was there
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.840]  at the exit of the theater the night of the shooting.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.480]  And he just said, I did it or something like that.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.320]  And by the way, I've wired my entire apartment with explosives.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.640]  So don't go near it.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.600]  That was the first incredible, you know, bizarre story.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.960]  And that was so they could send in a special federal team to cover up the seven medications
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.960]  that later still leaked.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.960]  See, they don't have everybody under their control.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.640]  But you see all the signs of the classic cover up right there.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:43:17.040]  There's no doubt in my mind now that Aurora was one hundred percent staged.

[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.040]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.360]  good sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:12.160]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.320]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.880]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.080]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:31.380]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.

[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:08.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.920]  He's the T. Rex of political talk.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:22.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:30.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, one reason I know that it's government psyops that is always running
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:36.760]  around saying I work for the CIA and all this stuff is because whenever I admit that I've
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:43.520]  had quite a bit of family that was in the CIA, they never attack that or go ferret into
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.520]  that because that's operations.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.040]  That's connected to their system.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.240]  They don't want that looked at.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.440]  That's why they make up outlandish stuff about me because they don't want you to believe
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.560]  there could be a real person standing up for liberty.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.400]  The info I'm giving you, I don't want you to trust me.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.640]  I want you to go look into it.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.960]  I want you to go find out that when we talk about mind control, that it's a real thing
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.560]  and that once you know what it is, you see it going on and you catch them red handed.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:15.440]  And I've told a few of the CIA stories just from, I mean, anybody I know in my family,
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.560]  they recruited heavily out of farming areas in Texas.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.920]  And I've talked to people or other family talks, people that were in the CIA, they were
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.760]  almost all army officers, that's where they recruit from, who were combat veterans who
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:30.240]  they then bring into it.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.040]  And all of the people in my family got out of it.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.640]  That's another lie that you don't get out of it.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.260]  That's pure bull, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.680]  And the point is, they won't ever even really talk much about it.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.400]  Just it's unspeakably horrible.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.140]  They run everything, the murder, the drugs, all of it.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:51.280]  One great uncle, it was basically, told my dad about it and then I asked about it a little
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:54.440]  ways, I'm not getting into that, but yeah, was like, okay, you're an army officer, we're
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.440]  sheep dipping you.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.640]  He'd been in the army for like 15 years, all over the world.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:04.120]  He said, we're now going to have you, this is your graduation, not as just a asset, but
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.500]  as a officer, as a full blown CIA agent.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:13.360]  And it was dealing drugs and reportedly killing people in Chicago.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.120]  And he said, I'm not doing that and got out of it.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:22.960]  And I mean, listen, it's the same story with anybody that I've talked to.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.600]  And folks, cuz it's not like it's a big deal that they really wanted to recruit out of
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:28.600]  some of the Alex Jones' relatives.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.600]  There's CIA everywhere.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.960]  It's like Jesse Ventura goes down on the first day at work, they go, somebody wants to talk
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.560]  to you in the bottom of the Capitol.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.760]  He goes down there, there's 26, whatever it was, CIA people, there were little old ladies
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.520]  and guys that looked like milkmen or beer men or whatever.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:46.780]  And they were CIA and wouldn't even say who they were, but it was national security.
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:52.120]  It's giant, ladies and gentlemen, and there's like 15, 16 agencies and private merc groups
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.680]  and it's so evil.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:59.560]  It is a mafia with mind control, and again, it works for the foreign banks.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.520]  And there's all these movies about the CIA loves you and the red, white and blue and
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.520]  oh my gosh.
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:09.840]  And they do have the light side that does the analyst stuff that they send in.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:12.200]  They send in the good guys are all like a joke.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.280]  They send them out on commando missions to be killed.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.600]  And again, they laugh at them.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.760]  And I've talked to Joel Skalzen, who's had those connections in family and stuff.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.480]  Same story, same deal.
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:29.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, they get the most gung-ho, meanest people they can, and then they see,
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:31.640]  are you evil, tough guy, or are you a nice, tough guy?
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.240]  And the nice, tough guys are cannon fodder.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.080]  So I'm gonna warn everybody, if you're a police officer and they want you to work for the
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.800]  feds and do bombing drills, they're gonna blow something up.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:42.960]  Maybe not your time, but down the road, they're gonna blow something up.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.140]  Say a cop did it to say the cops are terrorists.
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.360]  Even the feds wanna have a purge of you.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:51.600]  If you're military, they want you to join an intelligence agency and infiltrate criminal
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:52.600]  groups.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.560]  They're gonna burn you down the road and say, you do what we say and help load up these
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.000]  toddlers on a C-130 ten years after you're into it.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.960]  Or we're gonna expose all your bank robberies and all your drug dealing.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.840]  I mean, that's all this is, is about compromising everybody, okay?
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.800]  That's all this is.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.360]  And they're gonna destroy our culture because they're into it.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.400]  And I'm ranting, in this segment, the next, John Riverport, break down mind control.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:22.080]  You were getting into Jolyon West, his controller, Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.240]  What is admitted for people that don't know, so why we know James Holmes is under mind
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240]  control?
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240]  Go ahead.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:33.480]  Ewing Cameron, as I was starting to say before we went to the break, not only were they pulling
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.440]  people off the street, but people were coming to him as patients.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:43.920]  You know, somebody walks into his office, here's a famous psychiatrist up in Canada.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.840]  I'm not feeling very well and I think I need some, oh, sure, whatever.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:53.400]  And all of a sudden, that person, you know, from anywhere, could be you, could be your
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:52:02.680]  cousin, could be anybody, is now in a program where they're being put to sleep for 30 days
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:08.560]  with heavy, heavy drugs, wakened in the middle of the night for electroshock treatments,
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:15.160]  20 to 40 times higher than the usual torture of shock treatments.
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:20.400]  Then they're gonna be listening to Ewing Cameron with these tapes saying over and over again
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.600]  how he's creating a new personality.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:26.400]  And then they spit that out the other side.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:31.760]  New person, yeah, new person, totally destroyed, totally destroyed.
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:36.120]  And of course, you can read about this because there were lawsuits eventually brought and
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:40.680]  it was proven that Cameron was working on a contract via the CIA and they had to pay
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.300]  out some pit and some money to these people.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:48.700]  But this was just one little pocket of what MK Ultra was all about, destroying people
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:53.600]  totally to give them new synthetic personalities.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:57.100]  And again, they even have History Channel shows admitting it all.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.120]  And of course, it was also because they like to abuse kids.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:03.920]  That's really the cover, is the mind control and erasing their memories.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.480]  But expanding on that, you described how, yeah, not just kids off the street, wealthy
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.840]  people will bring in their daughter who was depressed at age 10 because they describe
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:15.520]  all the cases, thousands and thousands of something like 10,000 plus kids they know
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.520]  about.
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:20.440]  And they'd say, just commit her here, I'll make her perfect in a year.
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:24.480]  And they'd go here, take our daughter, worshipping the psychiatrist cuz he's gone.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:30.480]  And they would literally electroshock, drug him, rape him, everything else.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:34.240]  And that couldn't be true, the doctor wouldn't do something like that.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:40.380]  And let me tie that in, Alex, with what happens in ordinary psychiatry, see, because people
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:46.600]  have this false firewall that they build between MK Ultra and the CIA and psychiatry.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:49.080]  Just forget about that, erase that wall.
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:52.680]  You're in a university, you're a student, you're feeling a little bit jittery, anxious
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:54.520]  about exams, whatever.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:59.440]  You go in to see the psychologist, you get referred, and you're sitting in a psychiatrist's
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.440]  office.
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.140]  And then they give you a prescription for a drug.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:07.640]  And this is based on a story by Peter Breggin in his famous book Toxic Psychiatry.
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.920]  This was a girl that he calls Roberta.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.380]  And she has some anxiety about dating, and so ends up, this drug, well, we don't think
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:17.360]  that's the one, we'll give you this drug now.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.920]  And finally, they're putting her on serious, heavy anti-psychotic drugs.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.800]  And she gets to the point where she can no longer talk, function, this is a bright girl
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.800]  from a decent home, went to college, hey, the American way.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:39.440]  She's mumbling, she can't move without tremoring, she's knocking her head against the wall all
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:47.080]  the time, and eventually she comes to a general practitioner who says, this is all from the
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.960]  drugs.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.120]  They destroyed her life, she's never gonna be the same.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.840]  And nobody's prosecuted, nobody's criticized, it's the psychiatrist who did this.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:01.800]  This could happen to any student on any campus at any university-
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:07.940]  And let me tell you who it happened to in the early 1960s, it was a man named Ted Kaczynski.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.120]  You may have heard of him, the Unabomber.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:13.120]  And I believe they had him to cut out the whole time to put out that eugenics-based
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.600]  report he put out as a publicity stunt.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.240]  But he, in the LA Times, Alexander Cockburn was the one who exposed it in the LA Times,
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:25.200]  God rest his soul, recently passed, I believe I read that, double check that my memory fails.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:31.560]  The point is, he wrote about, it was declassified, Theodore Kaczynski was in the MK Ultra mind
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  control program.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:37.320]  He went in to a psychologist, psychiatrist, and they drugged him.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:42.680]  He disappeared into the program for years, comes out, but the media says there's no connection
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:43.840]  to his Unabomber.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.520]  There, you don't just have MK Ultra shooters, you've got MK Ultra bombers.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.140]  That's right.
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.720]  People disappear, they come back.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.880]  Yes, I was in this program, yes, I went to see a psychiatrist, this is what happened
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:59.840]  and so on and so forth.
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:03.700]  And the public doesn't want to believe this, you see, but this is what you have to look
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.700]  at and understand.
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:09.180]  And by the way, here's the headline, we're reaping tragic legacy from drugs.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:15.200]  The government LSD experiments to overuse of drugs like Ritalin, the consequences are
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:18.440]  overwhelming and is that the one that's got the, yeah, there it is, Theodore Kaczynski
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:24.780]  was in a CIA Harvard MK Ultra mind control experiments, LA Times, but I was saying double
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:27.600]  check is, I think Alexander Cockburn passed recently.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:30.120]  I think I know he did, but I want to double check that.
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:32.240]  Go ahead there, John.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.480]  Yeah, so you've got this kind of a program that spreads out tentacles all over the country.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.820]  And as I was saying in 1995, all of a sudden you had two women testifying before the president's
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:48.120]  committee on radiation experiments saying, yeah, but that was just a small part of what
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:51.120]  we were into since the time we were children.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:57.720]  We were basically tortured by army doctors, CIA doctors in a mind control program that
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.440]  radiation was just a small part of.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.920]  And the idea was they wanted to make us into sex agents and assassins.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:12.400]  And this is taking place in a committee room in Washington DC before a panel and an audience
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:19.280]  in the room and they get through testifying and the panel is absolutely silent.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.600]  And then one person says, well, thank you very much.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.780]  Next witness will please come up as if nothing ever happened.
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:31.340]  And as these two witnesses walk back from testifying, people in the audience get up
[01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:37.120]  and go over to them and say, thank God you said something because I was here to talk
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:42.960]  about radiation too, but the same thing happened to me that happened to you.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:54.760]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:56.000]  Tyranny is here.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.600]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:02.320]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.880]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.100]  on earth.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:12.920]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.760]  expanded nationwide.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.920]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.860]  powerful shadow state.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:24.880]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:30.400]  Prepare to enter the secret of world war of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.120]  cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.600]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.640]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:41.640]  It's here.
