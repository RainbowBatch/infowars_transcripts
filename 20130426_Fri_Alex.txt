[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:27.080]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.080 --> 00:36.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, April 26, 2013. And I'm your host, Alex Jones. And
[00:36.040 --> 00:39.960]  this is what it sounds like when I actually have a radio microphone in front of me. Most
[00:39.960 --> 00:45.040]  talk show hosts get a big, fancy microphone and they get right up on it and then they
[00:45.040 --> 00:50.380]  tweak it and tune it and put all these different effects on it to make their voice sound big.
[00:50.380 --> 00:55.380]  I do the opposite. Why? I don't know. But there are no effects on this microphone. This
[00:55.380 --> 01:01.480]  is just my voice. And yes, I'm bragging right now about my voice. And I'm sorry, ladies,
[01:01.480 --> 01:08.320]  when I'm taken, okay? I'm just acting stupid, folks. I'm joking. I'm sorry. That's what
[01:08.320 --> 01:13.640]  it sounds like because I come on and then my voice sounds so big that I feel guilty
[01:13.640 --> 01:20.760]  like I'm an egomaniac. I'm actually a Liberty maniac, ladies and gentlemen. And I'm not
[01:20.760 --> 01:27.000]  operating on a lot of sleep last night. I was up late here at the hotel with George
[01:27.000 --> 01:37.400]  W. Bush, Dick Cheney, the heads of Hunt Oil, and Joseph Curl of the Washington Times and
[01:37.400 --> 01:43.520]  drugsreport.com. And I'm not kidding. That's who I was hanging out with last night in a
[01:43.520 --> 01:51.560]  very, very bizarre turn of events. So here we are. I am at a hotel in Dallas, Texas.
[01:51.560 --> 01:57.800]  And George W. Bush is sitting on my lap. No, no. That part's a joke. My mother always liked
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.960]  this hotel. I'm not going to say what hotel because obviously we're incognito. But I'm
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.400]  up here in Dallas driving through a visiting family because I'm from Dallas. And then I'm
[02:08.400 --> 02:16.560]  going to go with my children and family and parents to another location in Texas. Why
[02:16.560 --> 02:22.440]  lie? Arkansas. So I'm taking a few days, just an extension of Texas or an extension of Arkansas.
[02:22.440 --> 02:29.880]  And so I come in the hotel and there's ambulances parked out front and there's Secret Service
[02:29.880 --> 02:38.520]  running around. And I guess they've got like four presidents right now. What is it? Clinton,
[02:38.520 --> 02:43.520]  Obama. You've got Bush, Sr., Bush, Jr. So that's four. Were there others? And so they're
[02:43.520 --> 02:48.680]  here for the opening of the Presidential Library. And then this is where some of them are staying.
[02:48.680 --> 02:57.960]  I know Bush lives in Dallas. But I'll tell the story later, obviously, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.860]  of Carol and I trying to crash the private Bush-Cheney party. And I'm not joking. I actually
[03:03.860 --> 03:10.280]  didn't hang out with them last night. But the cops then said, the cops recognized me
[03:10.280 --> 03:16.640]  definitely and were like, okay, no, you're not on the list. And then the police officer
[03:16.640 --> 03:23.980]  went on to say, what's the big joke here? And I said, it's not a joke. I mean, we see
[03:23.980 --> 03:29.080]  the Secret Service and Dick Cheney's ambulance that follows him around. And so we want to
[03:29.080 --> 03:34.160]  know, are they really here? And then later I noticed that they, oh, actually, Richard,
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.040]  it's laying over there by that lamp bud. And then go get yourself some lunch. Good job
[03:38.040 --> 03:40.920]  hooking up all this equipment. Richard Reeves on the road with us here, because even when
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.320]  I go on vacation for two or three days, I work. Over there is that list that I found
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.280]  in the bar. Yeah, bring that to me. I don't want to show the whole list because it'll
[03:52.280 --> 04:00.160]  say where we're at. Thank you. But here in my little hand is the list of who was at the
[04:00.160 --> 04:06.220]  private party last night. Carl Roe, along with Mr. Ray Hunt of Hunt Oil, will be throwing
[04:06.220 --> 04:11.240]  an event after the rest of the Bush Library dedication events. This has been described
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.200]  as our personal event and reunion for most of the people attending, attendees, our friends
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.380]  of former staff associated with George W. Bush administration. And again, Carl was here
[04:19.380 --> 04:24.320]  to cover it. He has an article up at drugsreport.com about Bush, the Washington Times writer. He
[04:24.320 --> 04:32.840]  was here to cover it. And we ran into each other in the bar. And I said, no, Bush and
[04:32.840 --> 04:38.400]  Cheney and all of them are upstairs. He goes, well, the big party, I was invited to that.
[04:38.400 --> 04:42.440]  He said, but that's at this other hotel. And I said, look, they're up there. And sure enough,
[04:42.440 --> 04:48.120]  they were. So just crazy. We've got all the big bullet news, the latest bombing news.
[04:48.120 --> 04:52.580]  It's all coming out that it was clearly a provocative action, at least setting up real
[04:52.580 --> 04:56.880]  terrorists a lot of attack bare minimum. And just a bunch of other news. It's all off the
[04:56.880 --> 05:03.240]  chart today. And we're on the road and with health threats on the rise such as West Nile

[08:16.200 --> 08:21.880]  and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday, April 26, 2013 worldwide
[08:21.880 --> 08:29.000]  broadcast. I come to you from my hometown of Dallas, Texas, here at the same hotel where
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.960]  Dick Cheney and other people are staying. I'm going to run into them last night. I'll
[08:31.960 --> 08:36.800]  tell you that story coming up later. Ran into one of the reporters for the Drudge Report
[08:36.800 --> 08:43.360]  as well. We tried to crash the party and I'm not kidding, I'm actually going to tell you
[08:43.360 --> 08:49.200]  that story coming up. Wow, here it is. You know, they said this a week ago, but now they're
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.200]  in the US. Parents deny son's guilt and accuse US of plot. No, no, actually they're still
[08:55.200 --> 09:01.280]  in Russia saying that yesterday. Now they're coming. This is in the New York Times and
[09:01.280 --> 09:05.640]  they go on to say the intelligence services have been on them for five years and had set
[09:05.640 --> 09:11.520]  them up and recruited them somehow. And that is exactly what they do in false flags. So
[09:11.520 --> 09:14.240]  there is the New York Times with that piece of news. We're going to be getting into that
[09:14.240 --> 09:22.320]  more today. Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to join us at the start of the next hour.
[09:22.320 --> 09:29.600]  And then we are also going to be getting Sebelle Edmonds on the broadcast. She was an FBI translator
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.760]  and witnessed them in the 9-11 stand down and running Al Qaeda. That's on record. She
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.080]  had to break a federal gag order to bring that information out to you. And people say,
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.920]  well, if stuff like this happened, you know, the government was involved in terror attacks,
[09:44.920 --> 09:49.320]  we would know someone would talk. A lot of people did talk. And then they spin it and
[09:49.320 --> 09:55.360]  say, Chris Matthews says, Alex Jones says George W. Bush had like Wile E. Coyote, this
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.900]  is exact words, with a plunger detonating it. I'm not saying that George W. Bush even
[10:01.900 --> 10:05.880]  probably knew what was going on because I later talked to somebody who was with him
[10:05.880 --> 10:14.400]  in the bunker with another one of the Bushes that night after it happened when he was basically
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.540]  scurrying around scared. I mean, not so much scared, but I mean, either that or he's a
[10:18.540 --> 10:23.120]  great actor, which I don't think George W. Bush is. But the people behind him, the globalists
[10:23.120 --> 10:30.920]  that control presidents, control societies, they created Al Qaeda, they run Al Qaeda,
[10:30.920 --> 10:37.080]  and they are using the threat of Al Qaeda to basically take over our society and make
[10:37.080 --> 10:38.080]  everyone a suspect.
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.120]  There's an article up at Infowars.com where a new FBI manual flyer says anyone taking
[10:43.120 --> 10:49.120]  pictures period or video anywhere is a suspected terrorist, put them in a terrorist database.
[10:49.120 --> 10:53.160]  And that's why the cops come up to you and arrest you now if you're videotaping the Eiffel
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.200]  Tower in Paris, or if you're videotaping the Washington Monument. I've actually had the
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.360]  police come over, we have this on tape, put it on the web, you've seen it, and say, what
[11:02.360 --> 11:03.360]  are you doing?
[11:03.360 --> 11:07.520]  And we're like, well, we're getting video of the Washington Monument. Why? Well, I don't
[11:07.520 --> 11:11.600]  have to answer your questions in America, but it's for my TV show. Do you have a permit
[11:11.600 --> 11:16.200]  for that? And I was actually sitting there with a C-Think film crew for the Independent
[11:16.200 --> 11:23.000]  Film Channel, and they looked at the cop and they go, DC doesn't give permits because you
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.080]  don't need a permit to be in a public place or on the street with a camera.
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.600]  You need a permit if you're gonna block a street. And the cop said, hey, I'm gonna arrest
[11:31.600 --> 11:37.680]  you if you don't leave. And so in America, we left just because we were there to get
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.240]  a job done and weren't there to fight for the First Amendment that day, but maybe we
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.880]  should have gotten arrested.
[11:42.880 --> 11:48.040]  Maybe we need to stop giving in every time we get pushed around. My point is it's about
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.760]  making us the suspects, but the novel idea of could it be the government or could it
[11:52.760 --> 11:57.200]  be elements in the government or could it be defense contractors that wanna sell trillions
[11:57.200 --> 12:03.240]  of dollars of more stuff and who wanna make America the war zone and get paid $10 billion
[12:03.240 --> 12:09.320]  per company per year to spy on our email and spy on what we're saying.
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.920]  This is all admitted now. Everything we talked about for so long is now admitted. And so
[12:14.920 --> 12:22.280]  now I'm telling you what's coming next. Now I'm telling you what's coming next. Now again,
[12:22.280 --> 12:33.600]  fighting shotgun with us today are Ja'Carri Jackson and the other InfoWars Nightly News
[12:33.600 --> 12:36.440]  reporter, one of the other reporters, David Knight.
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.080]  And again, our Skype is a little bit catchy today. So I wanna ask the network, every time
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.540]  my Skype cuts out and you go to backup Skype, will you give me a Roger Roger Houston that
[12:45.540 --> 12:52.240]  I'm on the air? Okay, Roger Roger, that's great. Cuz when I see my screen go black,
[12:52.240 --> 13:00.920]  and you guys are reconnecting, what'd you go to backup Skype there? Well done, Houston.
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.560]  They're actually in Austin, but Houston is close enough. And again, I'm here in Dallas
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.640]  orbiting around Dick Cheney right now, who is somewhere in the building. I can't make
[13:10.640 --> 13:12.200]  up the weirdness of all this.
[13:12.200 --> 13:19.680]  Is it synchronicity or serendipity that I ran into Dick Cheney and George Bush here
[13:19.680 --> 13:26.080]  in Dallas? Or no, it'd be like I ran into the Super Bowl. What do you know? I came to
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.520]  this town, the Super Bowl's happening there this weekend. No, the presidential library
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.160]  is being opened, and so that's why this happened. And I didn't even think of this. By the way,
[13:33.160 --> 13:42.600]  I was on my way yesterday, on my way driving up here, and right off I-35 is the town of
[13:42.600 --> 13:45.280]  West where that fertilizer plant blew up.
[13:45.280 --> 13:49.720]  So we thought, hey, let's pull over at the check shop, a place that has hot sandwiches.
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.880]  That's a Texas tradition. And about three blocks away is where the fertilizer plant
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.160]  blew up. So I said, let's drive by it. Well, we go driving by it on a city street, and
[14:00.160 --> 14:03.680]  the state police were even stopping firemen and stuff that were there for the funeral
[14:03.680 --> 14:04.680]  that had just ended.
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.000]  And there were helicopters flying above. I was told Obama had been there, but he was
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.460]  gone. And the state police came over with such pleasure and said, what do you think
[14:11.460 --> 14:16.160]  you're doing here? And we said, well, we're just driving by to see what's going on. And
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.320]  he goes, we can't go that way. And I go, okay, well, where do we turn around? He goes, well,
[14:20.320 --> 14:23.220]  you can't turn around. They start smiling at us.
[14:23.220 --> 14:27.240]  So I jump up, because Richard was driving, and peer out of the bus. And I said, oh, so
[14:27.240 --> 14:34.760]  I'm an American scum. You're enjoying watching me squirm. Well, I shot video of it. You basically
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.600]  have seen it. And people are like, Alex is a real wimp. He drove all the way up to West.
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.400]  And then when they told him to leave, he did. No, no, no, no, no. I am a wimp, but not in
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.960]  the way you think I am. I'm actually pretty tough.
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.800]  All right, I'm being sarcastic, folks. Not a lot of sleep. I apologize. The point is
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.320]  is that we were driving by and just thought we'd do a report for you. So it was kind of
[14:55.320 --> 15:02.160]  a drive by, a literal drive by media. But it just illustrates that then his commander,
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.680]  his superior comes over and goes, yeah, you can turn around right there. And the other
[15:06.680 --> 15:11.040]  guy was starting to get mad, like he was going to do something to us, because we're totally
[15:11.040 --> 15:12.040]  polite.
[15:12.040 --> 15:13.560]  We're like, no, we're just driving by. He goes, well, why do you think you're going
[15:13.560 --> 15:17.960]  to do that? Well, we're just, okay, we're just going to turn up there. No, you can't
[15:17.960 --> 15:25.400]  do that. Okay, where can we turn around? Well, you can't turn around. And then smiling at
[15:25.400 --> 15:33.080]  us. I mean, this is the essence of government. It's like a kid using a magnifying glass to
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.440]  burn ants or something or pull the wings off a butterfly, as Bradley Manning said about
[15:38.440 --> 15:40.440]  what the US military does overseas.
[15:40.440 --> 15:46.600]  I mean, someday it'll be like total Skynet robots, bombing and destroying and killing
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.040]  everybody in third world countries. I guess it's already happening. And then occasionally
[15:51.040 --> 15:55.480]  there'll be a bomb go off and they'll hype it up, like the nation just defeated some
[15:55.480 --> 16:01.520]  incredible threat. So we have the perception that there was some type of external thing
[16:01.520 --> 16:04.800]  going on and that we're not really the big empire taking over the world.
[16:04.800 --> 16:11.160]  And my biggest issue with the empire is not only is it immoral, but this giant mega empire
[16:11.160 --> 16:17.240]  that we're seeing unfold here, this giant mega empire, we're paying for it. And it's
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.320]  treating us just like it treats the other people that it's enslaving and destroying.
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.840]  This is not even an American empire. This is not an empire spreading liberty and freedom
[16:26.840 --> 16:31.020]  and the Bill of Rights and the Constitution like the CIA says. We overthrow countries
[16:31.020 --> 16:36.680]  to spread democracy. No, you put dictators and Al-Qaeda in and now you run Al-Qaeda publicly
[16:36.680 --> 16:40.800]  in Libya and Syria and all over the place.
[16:40.800 --> 16:46.900]  And then lecture me how I'm un-American to point out the global crime syndicate illegal
[16:46.900 --> 16:54.560]  mafia is sitting here now declaring that I'm the enemy as well. I mean, it's asinine. Meanwhile,
[16:54.560 --> 17:03.800]  big sis says Homeland is using 1000 more rounds per person than the army. But she denies the
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.260]  ammunition purchases are aimed at civilians.
[17:07.260 --> 17:12.440]  Even though this military government and that's what it is, is training to fight the American
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.200]  people and all their manuals and all their drills. You have enough ammo now to fight
[17:17.200 --> 17:24.280]  a 35 year war was a 27 year war in Iraq. It's now a 35 year war. They've gotten over a billion
[17:24.280 --> 17:28.640]  delivered. There's over a billion more that are on backorder that they they're gonna go
[17:28.640 --> 17:29.640]  over the next few years.
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.600]  And then they have these headlines everywhere. Alex Jones discredited. Alex Jones gets his
[17:35.600 --> 17:41.600]  day in Congress. Congress takes up the conspiracy theory. Drudge Report takes up the conspiracy
[17:41.600 --> 17:48.400]  theory, the debunk theory about bullets. And then you read about the bullets and they say,
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.720]  yes, we bought two plus billion bullets and it's discredited that you said we did.
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.680]  I mean, I'm actually reading mainstream news going the discredited bullet story. They're
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.080]  now having congressional hearings. Let's cut to that clip. And then she says, well, we've
[18:02.080 --> 18:05.760]  bought them to save money, but it's not aimed at the American people. And you know, the
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.800]  hollow points are illegal under the Geneva Convention.
[18:10.800 --> 18:16.220]  They are for target practice. When anyone knows you don't use hollow points that sometimes
[18:16.220 --> 18:20.320]  cost three to four to five times, they always cost more, usually about double for the cheaper
[18:20.320 --> 18:25.680]  brands than the ball target ammo. Any shooter knows that. And it's all the training and
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.680]  the army manuals and the drills to acclimate us and what we just saw in Boston. And then
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.480]  she's saying, but it's not for you. It's not for you. And then you get the manuals. It's
[18:34.480 --> 18:38.160]  for conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, gun owners, Ron Paul supporters,
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.160]  you name it.
[18:39.160 --> 18:44.180]  Now, again, riding shotgun today and they'll be popping in with news reports and the latest
[18:44.180 --> 18:48.280]  breaking information, Arijakari Jackson and David Knight. And we're gonna be getting into
[18:48.280 --> 18:55.040]  all of this information today. Ron Paul is coming up and a lot more. We're going to break
[18:55.040 --> 18:58.600]  here in just about a minute and a half. But I want to throw it to the reporters there
[18:58.600 --> 18:59.600]  to take us out to break.
[18:59.600 --> 19:03.240]  Then I'll come back and get into the bullet story. Then we're gonna get into and I'm gonna
[19:03.240 --> 19:08.400]  get their take on this, the latest on the Boston bombing where I should be tooting our
[19:08.400 --> 19:13.360]  horn here. I should be recapping it. But you know, as listeners, I mean, you know, you
[19:13.360 --> 19:17.260]  should be tooting your horn, not buying into it day one. But it's actually kind of sad
[19:17.260 --> 19:19.520]  and sick that we're right again.
[19:19.520 --> 19:27.960]  It's actually kind of sad and disgusting that it turned out to be a staged event. I mean,
[19:27.960 --> 19:33.040]  any way you cut it, any way you slice it, any way you dice it, these guys had CIA wiring
[19:33.040 --> 19:39.940]  up their snouts. I mean, they were absolute cutouts with the government obsessed with
[19:39.940 --> 19:49.840]  them for years, like white on rice. And now it's just all out there in front of everyone.
[19:49.840 --> 19:53.440]  Everything the parents said is now coming out. We'll be right back with Jacquari Jackson,
[19:53.440 --> 20:00.920]  David Knight. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Stay with us.

[21:31.440 --> 21:35.640]  why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been

[24:05.040 --> 24:18.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide from high atop the Dick Cheney Command
[24:18.040 --> 24:24.960]  complex in Dallas, Texas. I am actually broadcasting from high atop Dick Cheney's hotel with a
[24:24.960 --> 24:30.920]  train of ambulances behind him. You know when he shot that guy in the face out at that ranch
[24:30.920 --> 24:36.200]  in Texas, they reported they had three ambulances there. And when you go to a Bilderberg Group
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.640]  meeting sometimes they have like seven or eight ambulances for David Rockefeller and
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.980]  all the rest of them sitting out there. And I don't know why I'm going off into that.
[24:43.980 --> 24:49.760]  Sometime today, after Ron Paul comes on and we talk to Seabelle Edmonds, people keep saying
[24:49.760 --> 24:55.520]  why do you say Seabelle? She says that's how you pronounce it. Not Se-belle, she says Se-belle.
[24:55.520 --> 24:59.680]  And I respect how she wants it pronunciated. So Seabelle Edmonds is going to be joining
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.720]  us. Incredible whistle blower coming up at the bottom of the next hour. It's weird, you
[25:05.720 --> 25:08.480]  know when I go on vacation I just kind of get in the screwy moods. That's why I'm joking
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.160]  around a lot. But literally I am in the same building as Dick Cheney right now. And it's
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.600]  just like just a little man creeping around on a cane. But just think of all the New World
[25:16.600 --> 25:22.360]  Order stuff he's been involved in. Just amazing how fragile life is, how short it is. People
[25:22.360 --> 25:28.680]  take themselves so incredibly seriously. And then you've got the video up on Infowars.com
[25:28.680 --> 25:37.100]  that John Bowne and Mark Dice and Rob Jacobson went and produced. And I want to be clear,
[25:37.100 --> 25:43.060]  they did that shoot in 15 minutes in Oceanside, California by LA. And that is all the people
[25:43.060 --> 25:44.240]  they talked to.
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.600]  Okay, we did not go out there for five hours to find people that would sign a petition
[25:48.600 --> 25:52.280]  calling for America to be turned over to Nazi Germany and gun owners to be arrested and
[25:52.280 --> 25:57.040]  children to be injected with pure mercury. We went to English speaking people and explained
[25:57.040 --> 26:03.980]  it to them and they signed it. Because if you talk in a liberal voice, a snake voice,
[26:03.980 --> 26:08.600]  they're under a trance. We're gonna go out with a snake voice in Austin and we're gonna
[26:08.600 --> 26:12.520]  call for babies to be killed in America up to age three.
[26:12.520 --> 26:19.840]  We're gonna call for a law, so it's legal, for babies. And Dice is doing another one.
[26:19.840 --> 26:23.360]  Well, he's already done it. He's gonna have next week that's so controversial, he doesn't
[26:23.360 --> 26:29.040]  know if he should even air it. I mean, what he asked them and they all agreed it was time
[26:29.040 --> 26:36.000]  to burn people, murder people, bury people. I just can't even believe it. I don't wanna
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.160]  give away what he did. And again, we're gonna be doing this as well to illustrate how the
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.000]  public is in a zombified state.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.920]  And I gotta say it, it's liberals that are like this. Even mainline Republicans that
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.600]  have got their problems and wanna kill all the Muslims and have their issues, they have
[26:51.600 --> 26:59.680]  common sense and street smarts. I don't know, I mean, compared to Democrats. Democrats are
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.920]  scary and they always walk around talking about how smart they are all day. That's another
[27:03.920 --> 27:05.360]  thing they do.
[27:05.360 --> 27:09.880]  And they're not smart, they're dangerous and they're crazy. And I said we'd go to our guest
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.760]  host here who were there riding a shotgun with us today. They're gonna be popping in
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.280]  with news alerts and little tidbits of information throughout the day. But you know me in the
[27:18.280 --> 27:23.200]  first 30 minutes or so, I just get warmed up babbling, Texas style, hillbilly style.
[27:23.200 --> 27:26.240]  David Knight, Jocari Jackson, what are you gonna be interspersing today? Cuz you're gonna
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.480]  be hosting the third hour all by your lonesomes today.
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.540]  All by our lonesomes, okay. Well, I'm Jocari Jackson here with David Knight, just like
[27:34.540 --> 27:39.700]  Alex said. We have a few articles that we'll be conducting a little bit later. FBI conducts
[27:39.700 --> 27:45.880]  gun sweeps in Oakland, DHS and FBI warn of terrorists with cameras following Boston bombing.
[27:45.880 --> 27:49.920]  Now, this is exactly what we said would happen. And you have the Mad Als and other people
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.040]  of the world saying, they said this was gonna be used to take your rights or something and
[27:54.040 --> 27:55.040]  that's exactly what it is.
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.200]  And I'm sick of that dude saying that we're wrong and that I'm sick of that him. He has
[28:00.200 --> 28:05.320]  a man he needs to gut up and admit we've been telling the truth.
[28:05.320 --> 28:06.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[28:06.320 --> 28:07.320]  David, what do you have?
[28:07.320 --> 28:12.760]  Well, there's news that the US Mint is suspending sales of small gold coins at the same time
[28:12.760 --> 28:16.600]  premiums are rising. So it's gonna be interesting. We're gonna have Ron Paul on later. So be
[28:16.600 --> 28:20.240]  interesting to see. I know he follows gold pretty closely, what he makes out of all the
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.000]  shortages of gold and silver.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.600]  And of course, we know what's happening with ammo and there's an article about that on
[28:25.600 --> 28:26.600]  Info Wars today.
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.560]  And the thing about that, I think Ron Paul was on Bloomberg a couple days ago and they
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.440]  kept asking Ron Paul, why do you like gold? And he'd tell him why he likes gold and why
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.120]  do you like gold? And then they switched anchors and just kept asking him the same question
[28:39.120 --> 28:40.120]  over and over.
[28:40.120 --> 28:41.120]  And I think we actually have.
[28:41.120 --> 28:46.000]  I think they do that. I was on O.B. and Anthony's show. I think they do it like eight times.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.800]  Norton kept asking me the same question and I don't even know what that tactic is.
[28:49.800 --> 28:53.240]  I don't know. I guess they were trying to see if he would change his answer. And he
[28:53.240 --> 28:59.260]  always had, like always, he always said a well thought out, thought provoking answer,
[28:59.260 --> 29:04.260]  but they just weren't satisfied with his answer.
[29:04.260 --> 29:08.840]  You know, Alex, you were talking about how dumbed down everything is in the wake of this
[29:08.840 --> 29:13.200]  coming, the analysis of it. And there was an article that was on Lou Rockwell's page
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.560]  from Butler Shaffer. And he said, perhaps we ought to change the motto of the U.S. from
[29:17.560 --> 29:19.840]  in God we trust to ignorance is bliss.
[29:19.840 --> 29:24.080]  He said the failure in intelligence wasn't the fact that the FBI and the CIA and Homeland
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.180]  Security and all these other agencies had indicators that something was up with one
[29:28.180 --> 29:35.080]  of these brothers. Failure in intelligence is the American people abdicating their ability
[29:35.080 --> 29:37.240]  to look at information.
[29:37.240 --> 29:41.160]  I disagree with that. I think we should worship the image of not a golden calf, but of an
[29:41.160 --> 29:47.000]  ostrich with its head in the sand or its head in the toilet with a dead baby.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.640]  Yeah, we can replace the eagle with an ostrich and the motto.
[29:49.640 --> 30:02.640]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:02.640 --> 30:09.240]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal

[31:04.440 --> 31:08.400]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[31:08.400 --> 31:13.120]  arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for

[32:01.960 --> 32:06.480]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing
[32:06.480 --> 32:11.280]  was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as
[32:11.280 --> 32:16.720]  key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating

[33:08.760 --> 33:34.320]  on the GCN radio network. All right, folks, I'm coming to you from Dallas, Texas. Let
[33:34.320 --> 33:38.920]  me seriously get into some of the news here and then we're going to have Jakari Jackson
[33:38.920 --> 33:42.460]  and David Knight there in Austin, Texas. Break down some other important breaking news they
[33:42.460 --> 33:47.500]  have like Planned Parenthood running around saying, hey, women wear shirts saying I had
[33:47.500 --> 33:53.800]  an abortion. Absolutely. I sacrificed my child. I killed my child. I'm proud of it because
[33:53.800 --> 33:58.440]  you see they're losing the battle. Statistics and studies are showing people are turning
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.520]  against abortion. I'm not judging women that have had them. I'm not saying that you're
[34:02.520 --> 34:07.720]  a murderer. I'm saying you were manipulated into this. And now they're trying to make
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.640]  it something that's like laudable, like getting a gold medal or something. And in every culture,
[34:12.640 --> 34:17.360]  people have been lauded for killing their children. That's just something that's happened
[34:17.360 --> 34:25.760]  over and over and over again throughout civilization and in different different cultures. So what
[34:25.760 --> 34:32.560]  I want to do actually right now is throw it over to Jakari Jackson and David Knight.
[34:32.560 --> 34:36.160]  What I want to cover first is, gentlemen, the latest developments that we were first
[34:36.160 --> 34:42.480]  talking about, you know, back last Monday during the tragic first hours of the bombing,
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.720]  we said if there's a drill, if the patsies were in intelligence services or protected
[34:47.720 --> 34:56.200]  by them, if they use it for some big power grab like martial law to to basically condition
[34:56.200 --> 35:04.960]  us, if that happens, if we see all of these all of these different telltale signs, then
[35:04.960 --> 35:10.480]  we know it's an inside job or at least a provocateur to vent, which is a type of type of inside
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.680]  job. And indeed, ladies and gentlemen, that is what has now happened. And if you look
[35:15.680 --> 35:23.300]  at the New York Times, parents deny son's guilt and accuse U.S. of plot. Well, ladies
[35:23.300 --> 35:28.740]  and gentlemen, that's just the simple facts that one brother was killed, the other climbed
[35:28.740 --> 35:35.640]  out of a boat and was just fine and then suddenly had his throat cut out. And now what the senator
[35:35.640 --> 35:47.300]  first said back on Tuesday is now mainstream news that that all these agencies, CIA, FBI,
[35:47.300 --> 35:54.480]  you name it, all knew exactly who these guys were and were, quote, following them, tracking
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.340]  them. The Russians blew their cover and said, who are these guys? And then it came out two
[35:58.340 --> 36:02.380]  days ago and has been in no mainstream media except Foreign Russian News. They released
[36:02.380 --> 36:10.200]  the documents out of Georgia that indeed, Tamerlan Zardav, the older brother, indeed
[36:10.200 --> 36:16.920]  was in CIA sponsored Jamestown Association groups under Zbigniew Brzezinski, whose plan
[36:16.920 --> 36:22.800]  it is to radicalize Muslims and use them worldwide as the tool to take liberties here in America,
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.100]  in the Middle East and against Russia. And again, people say, what are you saying? There
[36:26.100 --> 36:30.680]  aren't radical Muslims. My whole world's about hating Muslims. And, you know, my dog's got
[36:30.680 --> 36:35.520]  an Al-Qaeda chew toy. No, no, no, I'm not saying there aren't radical Muslims and there
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.240]  isn't a clash of civilizations. What I'm saying is the globalists are throwing fuel
[36:40.240 --> 36:44.720]  on the fire as a way to take our liberties and have an excuse for all these wars and
[36:44.720 --> 36:45.720]  empires.
[36:45.720 --> 36:51.400]  And they use them like a Swiss army knife or a skeleton key for every job. Going back
[36:51.400 --> 36:56.240]  like, this goes back to the British using radical Muslims out of Saudi Arabia to overthrow
[36:56.240 --> 36:59.860]  the different countries that were there before, turned into one big country. And now they've
[36:59.860 --> 37:05.200]  used those guys worldwide. Hitler took over the Middle East for oil during the start of
[37:05.200 --> 37:10.400]  World War Two and Rommel went in and for the few years he had it before he got kicked down.
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.760]  What did they do? They set up and expanded the Muslim Brotherhood. Now at the end of
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.880]  World War Two, the keys got handed from Hitler over to the United States. And then Israel
[37:19.880 --> 37:23.600]  was set up basically as a command base over there, whether you support Israel or don't,
[37:23.600 --> 37:27.160]  or whether you just want peace over there. The point is it was set up as like an aircraft
[37:27.160 --> 37:32.760]  carrier out there in the Middle East to basically be a base of military operations.
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.960]  And again, this wasn't done to democratize or bring freedom over there. It was done to
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.280]  put radical Muslims in charge. Look what we did, kicking out Mubarak, who wasn't a great
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.320]  guy, a Western-backed dictator, but he was a dictator back when the US wasn't as openly
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.440]  evil. We had corrupt people in there, but they weren't just absolutely pure evil. Now
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.160]  he's gone after 31 years and they're putting basically al-Qaeda light in. So that's my
[37:56.160 --> 38:02.240]  take on that. But this is a case of, this has absolutely come out in the open. And I
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.280]  want you guys to spend about five minutes breaking that down. And I want the guys to
[38:06.280 --> 38:09.680]  bring me down while you're doing that, because I want to readjust my camera. It actually
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.480]  fell off the computer here, so I have to rerun.
[38:13.480 --> 38:18.280]  All right, we're here, I think. Picking up on what Alex was talking about, here's some
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.080]  of the agencies, according to the official story, that knew about this attack. You had
[38:22.080 --> 38:29.500]  the FBI, the CIA, US Customs and Border Protection, Boston Joint Terror Task Force, TIDE, that's
[38:29.500 --> 38:35.200]  the Terrorist Identities Data Mart Environment, and Homeland Security itself. All of these
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.920]  people had red flags raised to them about Tamerlan, the older brother.
[38:40.920 --> 38:43.280]  And yet, they didn't catch anything. Now the whole-
[38:43.280 --> 38:46.640]  And Napolitano said that she knew about it, but she didn't think it was a big deal.
[38:46.640 --> 38:51.800]  Yeah, yeah. Janet, you failed us. All right, Homeland Security failed us. If you even look,
[38:51.800 --> 38:55.680]  if you don't look at anything else but the official story, you have to say that Homeland
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.320]  Security, which was created 12 years ago in the aftermath of 9-11, the whole rationale
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.480]  for the creation of Homeland Security was that we've got all these bureaucracies that
[39:04.480 --> 39:07.700]  aren't sharing information with each other, that aren't communicating with each other.
[39:07.700 --> 39:12.440]  So we need one gigantic bureaucracy to rule them all. Okay, and that's what we've got
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.460]  with Homeland Security. And guess what? They're offering the same excuse they did 12 years
[39:16.460 --> 39:17.460]  ago.
[39:17.460 --> 39:18.460]  Right, right.
[39:18.460 --> 39:21.880]  They're offering us Homeland Security. Why did we centralize all this investigation?
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.120]  I mean, at that very level, their story has no credibility, and we should not be handing
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.080]  over any liberty to them at all. And we should take back the liberties that they took, because
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.980]  it wasn't a very good exchange for us.
[39:32.980 --> 39:37.240]  And that's exactly the point, because not just terrorism databases, but all kinds of
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.400]  databases. You have the NSA, data mining centers, and all this stuff. And even with all the
[39:41.400 --> 39:47.240]  information they illegally collect on US citizens, they still can't keep people from committing
[39:47.240 --> 39:52.040]  crimes. I'm not necessarily referring to the Boston bombing suspects, but just in general,
[39:52.040 --> 39:55.480]  they can't keep people from committing the crimes with all the resources that they have.
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.960]  Well, even if you look at the war on drugs, you have scores of people dying from drug
[40:00.960 --> 40:03.680]  overdoses in federal prisons every year.
[40:03.680 --> 40:04.680]  Exactly.
[40:04.680 --> 40:09.760]  They can't stop the flow of drugs in prisons to the extent that inmates can not only get
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.680]  drugs, but get enough of them to have an overdose. What kind of a society would we have to live
[40:13.680 --> 40:17.760]  in for them to be able to interdict drugs to protect us from ourselves? So the whole
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.720]  idea of using force and interdiction to stop everything is a failed idea.
[40:22.720 --> 40:28.000]  But it's just when you look at even the no fly list and the absurdity of that, the fact
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.360]  that this tide thing flagged Tamerlan when he was heading back to Russia. And they decided
[40:34.360 --> 40:39.040]  to let him fly anyway. And yet you have children who are put on the no fly list. You have Wade
[40:39.040 --> 40:43.600]  Hicks who had just been vetted by Homeland Security, had been vetted by the FBI for enhanced
[40:43.600 --> 40:45.320]  security checks.
[40:45.320 --> 40:50.600]  And was stopped mid journey to Japan to see his wife in the military and stranded in Hawaii
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.740]  because he couldn't fly anywhere. Never was given any explanation. So this kind of authoritarian
[40:55.740 --> 41:00.840]  bureaucracy that doesn't pay any attention to the law and just rides roughshod over people
[41:00.840 --> 41:03.800]  is accountable to no one and will not tell anybody.
[41:03.800 --> 41:06.980]  To this day, people who are put on the no fly list are not ever told if they're ever
[41:06.980 --> 41:10.760]  taken off of it. They're never told why they were even put on it. It's like some kind of
[41:10.760 --> 41:15.640]  a star chamber where you're accused in absentia. But at least the star chamber would tell people
[41:15.640 --> 41:18.680]  what they were accused of. We don't even get that from Homeland Security.
[41:18.680 --> 41:22.440]  And you brought up a good point. You said that they're not accountable to anybody. And
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.880]  we saw that with Napolitano, which he was being grilled by, I believe, the congressman.
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.520]  And he said, what's up with this Saudi guy? And she said, well, if I think it's a big
[41:29.520 --> 41:32.400]  deal, I'll get around to telling you it's a big deal.
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.580]  Yeah, sit down, congressman. Don't talk to me. And that's kind of the attitude that you're
[41:35.580 --> 41:39.920]  getting about these ammunition purchases as well, right? When they say, why are you getting
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.080]  a thousand times? Why are you using, if you divide it out by the number of people there,
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.320]  why are you using a thousand times more rounds than the Army's using?
[41:47.320 --> 41:50.000]  Well, I can't tell you that. I'm not gonna tell you that.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.480]  And I think that's a very good point to bring up. I mean, when you're using more rounds
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.440]  domestically than you need in a foreign occupation, I mean, that's a pretty big deal.
[41:59.440 --> 42:00.440]  Mm-hm, yeah, absolutely.
[42:00.440 --> 42:03.640]  And nobody wants to talk about that. They don't wanna talk about the fully automatic
[42:03.640 --> 42:08.200]  AR-15s. They don't wanna talk about the armored vehicles. And everybody, well, not everybody,
[42:08.200 --> 42:12.460]  but you see some of the naysayers saying, well, they bought dump trucks too. Okay, yeah,
[42:12.460 --> 42:13.460]  they bought dump trucks.
[42:13.460 --> 42:18.200]  They also have armored vehicles that they say can withstand mines, landmines. They said
[42:18.200 --> 42:21.800]  they need those for warrant sweeps. I know a lot of the Crips in the Bloods like to use
[42:21.800 --> 42:26.440]  landmines in their daily activities and whatnot. That makes absolutely no sense. But I wanna
[42:26.440 --> 42:31.360]  get to this, David. We have a link on Drudge, maybe you guys can pull it up, update.
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.520]  Falsely identified Boston bomber found dead in the river. And I believe Alex has been
[42:35.520 --> 42:39.720]  talking about this for some time saying that bodies are gonna pop up in the river and sure
[42:39.720 --> 42:45.220]  enough they did. Falsely identified Boston bomber found dead in river. One of the individuals
[42:45.220 --> 42:51.080]  identified as a possible Boston bombing accomplice has been found dead in the Providence River.
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.280]  Police in Providence pulled a man's body from the Providence River on Tuesday. And authorities
[42:55.280 --> 43:01.080]  said, it's very possible that it is, forgive me for this pronunciation.
[43:01.080 --> 43:07.680]  Sunlee Tripathi, a former Brown University student who has been missing since mid-March.
[43:07.680 --> 43:11.880]  It was pointed out that the image bore a similarity to one of the suspect's first name by the
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.440]  FBI. And I remember we had the caller call in the other day and he said, maybe we should
[43:16.440 --> 43:17.440]  do some crowdsourcing.
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.000]  And I don't think crowdsourcing is necessarily a bad thing. But when you get to the point
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  where you're harassing people in the very scenario I gave that caller was, they're gonna
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.640]  start harassing little girls with backpacks. The little girl had a black backpack and it
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.280]  gets way out of hand. But I think it can be a very useful thing, just something to use
[43:33.280 --> 43:34.440]  with extreme caution.
[43:34.440 --> 43:38.800]  Well, we have an article on Info Wars from Kurt Nemo. And he says the DHS and FBI are
[43:38.800 --> 43:42.920]  warning of terrorists with cameras following the Boston bombing. Now, we just had Peter
[43:42.920 --> 43:48.460]  King, former chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security saying that, well, we
[43:48.460 --> 43:51.600]  could have stopped this or found these guys quicker if we had more cameras.
[43:51.600 --> 43:55.000]  Well, they had a lot of cameras at the finish line of Boston Maryland.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.880]  They confiscated cameras from people who were there just filming.
[43:57.880 --> 44:02.840]  Right, what they don't want, they don't want a free press. They don't want a free citizenry.
[44:02.840 --> 44:07.200]  They don't want people taking pictures of their crime scenes because they want to control
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.560]  what information comes out and what information doesn't. And along that line, we look at this,
[44:11.560 --> 44:17.800]  the implausibility of these two brothers, the second one with a white backpack.
[44:17.800 --> 44:22.520]  Now, immediately it was obvious because for days they've been talking about a black backpack.
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.520]  And then when they flagged these guys, they didn't say anything initially about the second
[44:26.520 --> 44:31.160]  guy having a white backpack. And so we started talking about it. And then immediately CNN
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.960]  comes on with an explanation, says, well, this is what it would have been.
[44:33.960 --> 44:41.280]  I think it was less than an hour after that press conference. CNN came up with their own
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.120]  probable cause situation for why the backpack was white and not the black backpack. This
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.460]  was nothing that they got from the FBI that we know of. It's just something that came
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.780]  up on their own. Yeah, they just pulled bags out of bags.
[44:52.780 --> 44:58.240]  They did have an FBI former FBI profiler, as they introduced him.
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.680]  An FBI profiler, I wanna tell this story. I've told it to David and I've told it to
[45:02.680 --> 45:07.000]  the guys in the back. Back when I was in college, I wouldn't say I was recruited by the FBI,
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.880]  but the FBI approached me at a career fair cuz I was studying criminal justice.
[45:10.880 --> 45:14.400]  And said, hey, when you get your degrees, you come check out the FBI. And I just asked
[45:14.400 --> 45:18.680]  him basic question, what about all that FBI profiling I see on the movies? He said, there
[45:18.680 --> 45:24.280]  is no position in the FBI called FBI profiler, none.
[45:24.280 --> 45:28.480]  And you can verify that at the FBI's website. We went there and looked at FBI, it's the
[45:28.480 --> 45:33.520]  careers section. And if you look at item number 17, because I must get this request a lot,
[45:33.520 --> 45:38.640]  it says, I'd like to be an FBI profiler. And they say, there is no such job as an FBI profiler.
[45:38.640 --> 45:40.600]  But they had an FBI profiler, according to CNN.
[45:40.600 --> 45:45.280]  Yeah, he has an FBI profiler. If you guys can dig that up, that would be really great,
[45:45.280 --> 45:47.100]  even if we have to wait till the next segment.
[45:47.100 --> 45:51.980]  So he came on and he was ready with a demonstration. Now, here's the question, okay? I think that's
[45:51.980 --> 45:57.680]  somewhat implausible, but he's saying that he had the black backpack with a bomb inside
[45:57.680 --> 46:02.680]  of a white backpack. He would take that out and then leave it down there and then put
[46:02.680 --> 46:04.640]  the white backpack on and go, okay?
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.300]  Well, if he was so clever to do that, why didn't the older brother, who is a mastermind,
[46:09.300 --> 46:14.240]  why didn't he do the same thing? Okay, why didn't he have a white backpack with a black
[46:14.240 --> 46:19.920]  backpack bomb inside of it? I mean, it just makes no sense. And we're told that they don't
[46:19.920 --> 46:25.280]  have any video of the older brother setting anything down, but we do have, they say, video
[46:25.280 --> 46:27.040]  of the younger brother setting something down.
[46:27.040 --> 46:28.400]  Who nobody has seen.
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.920]  Exactly, they will not show you the video. Now, think about this, no person identified
[46:32.920 --> 46:38.120]  by the name in the investigation is saying that they saw the videos, okay? The governor
[46:38.120 --> 46:45.200]  of Massachusetts said that he went to a briefing and they described the video to him, but they
[46:45.200 --> 46:46.680]  didn't show the governor of Massachusetts.
[46:46.680 --> 46:48.200]  My gosh, they described it.
[46:48.200 --> 46:49.480]  Yeah, they described it. So-
[46:49.480 --> 46:54.420]  That's some damning evidence right there. They described a video that nobody has seen.
[46:54.420 --> 47:00.160]  But that's the whole point of the suspicion about the younger brother, Zohar, is this
[47:00.160 --> 47:04.980]  video where he supposedly took this backpack out of the other one and left it and ran.
[47:04.980 --> 47:05.980]  It's crazy.
[47:05.980 --> 47:10.980]  Also, guys, again, Alex Jones popping back in here, guys, great points you're making,
[47:10.980 --> 47:15.760]  is you have the police chief, the big guy that everybody sees at the press conferences.
[47:15.760 --> 47:23.120]  He said on Fox that he had the whole video of this described to him. Percy said it is
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.680]  just chilling and riveting video. And they said, you've seen it? Well, no, no, no, no.
[47:28.680 --> 47:33.240]  I had it described to me. But listen, all that is sad issues. I think it's important
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.600]  to list it all as part of the overall continuum of this. But you have to understand, you've
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.300]  got a drill at the exact same time. You've got them desperate to cover up that drill.
[47:42.300 --> 47:45.560]  You've got all these other people with backpacks there, which again are part of the drill.
[47:45.560 --> 47:49.340]  We're not saying they're in on it. They're there so that no one can ever find the real
[47:49.340 --> 47:54.140]  guy with the bomb, so the real guy can slip in. How do you in a country, in a world where
[47:54.140 --> 47:58.320]  they know there's gonna be thousands of cameras, they want the thousands of cameras to create
[47:58.320 --> 48:03.760]  all this fear to usher in a fundamental change in our society towards open martial law.
[48:03.760 --> 48:08.680]  They'll just call it security. They'll call it public safety. How do you have that fundamental
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.760]  shit? Well, you gotta have the footage. But how do you then bomb something and then get
[48:14.760 --> 48:19.380]  your backpack bombs in or whatever they were really in, and then have the real perpetrator
[48:19.380 --> 48:25.080]  be able to slip out? It's the old spy trick of have 20 people show up at the same restaurant
[48:25.080 --> 48:30.120]  dressed the same way so that people can't find out who's handing off a package. This
[48:30.120 --> 48:38.400]  is all classic spy stuff out of real spy craft. To have the drill, in case you get caught,
[48:38.400 --> 48:41.360]  to say you're part of the drill. And then I say, okay, there's a drill. That just bumped
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.840]  it up to 90% chance. I said this the day it happened. Okay, a drill's confirmed. People
[48:45.840 --> 48:52.680]  are saying drills. Okay, the Boston Globe admitted that there was a drill. They had
[48:52.680 --> 48:57.560]  a drill years before there of the same thing happening. Okay, that just bumped up to 90%.
[48:57.560 --> 49:01.400]  Because if you have a drill at the exact same place, exact same time of a bombing, that's
[49:01.400 --> 49:05.760]  what it was for. Unbelievable, you're at 90%. Now, if it comes out, they're being shadowed
[49:05.760 --> 49:12.000]  by the FBI and CIA. Kurt Nemo wrote, if they were sent by these foundations that are trying
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.860]  to undermine Russia by sending in Muslim extremists, and we listed the organizations, then it goes
[49:16.860 --> 49:23.000]  to 99%. And folks, it's gone to 99%. And then you get them covering up, trying to kill the
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.560]  brothers, silencing the other brother, dead bodies popping up, the cover up of this Saudi
[49:28.560 --> 49:32.920]  that somehow is involved. I don't know if it's a patsy or maybe the target. I mean,
[49:32.920 --> 49:37.320]  we don't know, but we know this guy is at the White House. We know Michelle is visiting
[49:37.320 --> 49:42.740]  him, the first lady. We know this guy is on no fly list. Because again, you've got agencies
[49:42.740 --> 49:46.920]  that aren't actually terrorists that will pick up on these people and put them on a
[49:46.920 --> 49:47.920]  list.
[49:47.920 --> 49:51.440]  Or they've done this, they put them on a list. So when something gets blown up, or they want
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.040]  to set them up later, they say, look, we were watching them. That's then uses the proof
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.160]  against them as well. And the fact that they're allowed to get on and off planes, Tamerlan
[50:00.160 --> 50:05.880]  is the older brother, with fake names. Boom, ladies and gentlemen, we know the workshops
[50:05.880 --> 50:11.500]  he attended with the CIA. We know what he did. We know he went around to mosque to jump
[50:11.500 --> 50:17.620]  up and say, I wanna kill infidels to test and see if there were real radicals in those
[50:17.620 --> 50:18.620]  mosques.
[50:18.620 --> 50:23.880]  But see, when you get hired, cuz they were secular at first, party guys, get money, be
[50:23.880 --> 50:28.200]  Playboy type guys. They were rock stars, they're out partying, they're not real Muslims. The
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.280]  point is, when you go out and take part in the drills or when you take part as an infiltrator
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.860]  posing as a Muslim extremist, you are now creating the history and the ledger to be
[50:37.860 --> 50:42.560]  set up. That's what happened with Tim McVeigh, Lee Harvey Oswald, and everybody else. This
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.720]  is a total intelligence operation. It is a false flag. And when we come back, I'll tell
[50:47.720 --> 50:52.080]  you the motive for it, then we'll get into the latest on the bullets. The media is in
[50:52.080 --> 50:57.080]  full panic mode trying to cover this up. They are preparing for war against the American
[50:57.080 --> 51:00.600]  people, folks. And if this story gets out, it's over for them.
[51:00.600 --> 51:06.120]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[51:06.120 --> 51:12.000]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.360]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.400]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[51:20.400 --> 51:24.960]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[51:24.960 --> 51:27.760]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.280]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[51:32.280 --> 51:36.560]  And they're so easy to use. You just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.000]  so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[51:40.000 --> 51:48.120]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV
[51:48.120 --> 51:57.040]  or go to FAKETV.COM. That's 877-5325388 or FAKETV.COM.
[51:57.040 --> 52:04.040]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[52:27.040 --> 52:34.040]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[52:57.040 --> 53:03.040]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[53:27.040 --> 53:35.040]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[53:57.040 --> 54:04.040]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[54:27.040 --> 54:31.240]  Paul's going to be joining us for 30 minutes, start of the next hour. So be sure to stay
[54:31.240 --> 54:35.560]  with us on that. We're going to ask him about a whole bunch of issues coming up from the
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.280]  Boston bombing to his new homeschooling curriculum to where he thinks the new order is going
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.400]  and what's happening with gold. That is all coming up with former Congressman Dr. Ron
[54:43.400 --> 54:44.400]  Paul.
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.440]  And then we have C. Bell Edmonds, the whistleblower, coming on. Look, you all know the motives.
[54:48.440 --> 54:53.160]  Set the precedent, as they said, this is like 9-11. You even see the PR rollout. We're now
[54:53.160 --> 54:58.120]  going to be on the streets. You're now all suspects. And what do you say to that, having
[54:58.120 --> 55:07.120]  the Bill of Rights suspended? USA, USA, USA, cheering tyranny with the chance of USA, USA,
[55:07.120 --> 55:15.400]  USA. So the motive is let the military industrial complex eat America fully. This foreign offshore
[55:15.400 --> 55:20.820]  bank owned monstrosity that is installing Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria so we can fight
[55:20.820 --> 55:25.000]  the next war with them to its full spectrum dominance and its way to make us all suspects
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.880]  and then get CISPA passed and just absolutely butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[55:30.880 --> 55:35.880]  and distract from Obama imploding America and shutting down our power plants and shipping
[55:35.880 --> 55:37.160]  our jobs overseas.
[55:37.160 --> 55:40.200]  So it's all meant to make us rally around and see the government as the daddy, as the
[55:40.200 --> 55:47.000]  mommy, as Chris Rock said. Obama's like your dad, so shut up and do what he says. Kim Jong
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.520]  Un, he's like our dad, so shut up and do what he says. Hitler, he's like our dad, shut up
[55:52.520 --> 55:57.920]  and do what he says. I mean, that's what every group that loves authoritarianism says. And
[55:57.920 --> 56:03.240]  you watch that video up at Infowars.com that has to go viral everywhere. Californians signed
[56:03.240 --> 56:06.000]  petition to bring in Nazi rule.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.760]  And they would say, yeah, please sign the petition to confiscate the guns and bring
[56:08.760 --> 56:13.820]  in Nazi fascism in America. And these are people that spoke English, black, Hispanic,
[56:13.820 --> 56:21.520]  you name it, white, mainly whites and Hispanics. And that's the people, that's everyone that
[56:21.520 --> 56:26.080]  we asked. It's not like we're cherry picking here. They were out there 15 minutes, it's
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.760]  like a seven minute video.
[56:27.760 --> 56:30.240]  Cuz they just cut out the parts where they were waiting for somebody to walk up on the
[56:30.240 --> 56:37.400]  boardwalk. Everyone we talked to, except for one group of people, that's like 90% said,
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.720]  we want to take the guns and live under Nazi rule. Because they don't know even what Nazis
[56:41.720 --> 56:45.800]  are. It's like it's for the Earth, the children, the Nazis will run everything and take the
[56:45.800 --> 56:46.800]  guns.
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.440]  I'm for that, thank you. Thank you for supporting the Nazis, ma'am. And we're gonna get more
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.640]  and more extreme, more and more insane with the stuff we're gonna call for and people
[56:56.640 --> 57:00.800]  are going to sign for it. Now shifting gears, we're gonna cover this more after Ron Paul
[57:00.800 --> 57:02.840]  leaves. This is a big deal.
[57:02.840 --> 57:08.200]  The listeners of this broadcast, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and give credit where credit
[57:08.200 --> 57:15.120]  is due. DrudgeReport.com rammed this story just like the TSA and so many other issues
[57:15.120 --> 57:20.520]  into light. When we first started reporting on it a year ago, it was only a billion bullets.
[57:20.520 --> 57:28.080]  Since then, it's about a year and a half period now, it's over 2 billion, 200 million bullets.
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.200]  And it's training with paper targets of children. People couldn't even believe that, it's on
[57:32.200 --> 57:38.400]  record. This is all designed for us, this whole program. And the fact that they, in
[57:38.400 --> 57:43.720]  every news article bashing us and saying Infowars is lying, Drudge is lying, these crazy congressmen
[57:43.720 --> 57:45.760]  have picked up what Drudge and Jones are doing.
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.680]  And I mean, she got asked about it last week, she got asked again today. Hey, what about
[57:50.680 --> 57:54.080]  the 2 billion bullets? She goes, well, Drudge is not a credible source. And he's like, but
[57:54.080 --> 57:59.280]  Drudge linked to Forbes, I mean, isn't that credible? Of course, it's all credible. Because
[57:59.280 --> 58:04.480]  it's the government's purchase orders, their own website. And then they say in all the
[58:04.480 --> 58:11.400]  articles, the debunked Drudge story, yeah, these people are nuts.
[58:11.400 --> 58:15.840]  Yeah, we bought 2 billion bullets, it's no big deal. It's like we're debunked cuz we
[58:15.840 --> 58:20.400]  broke it, pushed it, and they're like, man, look at these crazy people. They said there
[58:20.400 --> 58:24.020]  was a rodeo going on in this town and we showed up, there was a rodeo, they're debunked. Or
[58:24.020 --> 58:27.640]  look at this crazy guy, he says he's in Dallas, Texas and there he is in Dallas, Texas. This
[58:27.640 --> 58:32.400]  is nuts. This guy is, you know, this guy, two plus two equals four. He's crazy cuz he's
[58:32.400 --> 58:43.240]  right. I mean, it is just, it's debunked cuz we got the bullets and they're for you.

[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.200]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:30.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday. I'm at Big D on a short family get-together.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.160]  Just so I happen to be in the same building as Dick Cheney right now. I'll tell that story
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.400]  briefly later. I pretty much already told it. Dick Cheney and more. Hunt Oil, you name
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.600]  it. George W. Bush. I've got five presidents here in town right now. Speaking of money,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.140]  I wish it was our president. Ron Paul is scheduled to be calling in any minute now to spend a
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:55.840]  half hour with us today. And I'm going to bring up a cornucopia of issues. And I have
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.180]  the guys come in and co-host even when I'm there because I enjoy their ideas and banter
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:04.240]  and it's thought-provoking. But Jacquari Jackson and David Knight are riding shotgun up there
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.560]  also in case we have any technical difficulties, as we are coming to you via the internet right
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:20.240]  now. The wonders of the internet. And we do have Congressman Ron Paul joining us today.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.640]  Again, I'm on the road. So I have a couple of my Infowars Nightly News reporters riding
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.020]  shotgun with us for the next 30 minutes. In case anything cuts out, they'll be able to
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.400]  ask the former congressman questions. It's great to have you on with us today, sir.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.680]  Thank you, Alex. Good to be with you. Wow, so much is happening. I want to get into your
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.960]  homeschooling curriculum. I hope to actually promote it later when you start that affiliate
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.720]  program. I think everybody should get involved in that. But before we go there, what do you
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:52.520]  make of Boston and that whole martial law spectacle that we saw? Well, it's rather scary.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.560]  You know me that I always try to look onto positive things and think things can't be
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:02.540]  quite as bad. But those pictures really concern me. You know, I mean, that is such a visual
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:08.040]  image when you see these thousands and thousands of troops. And they weren't your local friendly
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:16.040]  policemen that were involved. And it was accepted too easily. I mean, can you imagine all these
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.080]  people being locked? They became prisoners. And then the police, the military police were
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.960]  allowed to march into any house, any time without a search warrant. It was martial law,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:34.320]  you know. So I think it was very, very scary. It's just a hope. It wakes up some people.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.560]  But unfortunately, you still hear those. Well, the government has to do something to make
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.720]  us safe. And I think that's where the big disconnect is, is what is the purpose of government?
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.160]  Is it to give us perfect safety and perfect economic security? Or is it there to allow
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.980]  us to run our own lives and protect our liberties? I want to expand on that because we're going
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.160]  to break here in a moment. This is our short segment again. Former congressman and Dr.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:06.040]  Ron Paul joins us are very active in the defense of liberty. I want to expand again in the
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.380]  next segment on the Boston issue because some stations join us. Then I want to get your
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:17.840]  full take on that. But I mean, clearly any excuse the power structure has to grab power,
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.480]  they do it. And it seems that that appetite is getting more and more intense. Why do you
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.000]  think that's happening? Well, the problems are getting bigger. They say that Congress
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.400]  isn't doing a job because they're broke. But it's the it's the whole system that's broke.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.440]  We're financially broke. But those individuals in Washington, their mentality is different
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.160]  than so many of people outside of Washington, because they've told me personally, that they
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.680]  need to take care of people. And they need to regulate people's lives, because we can't
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.960]  trust it to themselves, because they may hurt themselves, or they may not take care of themselves.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:55.080]  And I've asked them, I said, Why is that the case? Well, they're too stupid. And inferring
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:01.280]  we the politicians know what is best. I mean, that is a mental status that they have, and
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.840]  they cling to real and then they don't do like, I'm Hitler, and I'm gonna take over
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.640]  I'm gonna take away liberties. I'm doing the Lord's work. I care about people. You've
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.440]  heard the liberals say that they care about people we don't. But of course, if you really
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.640]  care about people, you'll protect liberty, and there'll be more production and more people
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.720]  taking care of instead of special interests taking over control of our government in the
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.200]  wrong people benefiting. But anyway, that's the mess that we have is continuing. So every
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.920]  time there's an opportunity, they think, Well, if I enhance my power, I can do more good
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:41.120]  for the world. Although there's sinister reasons for us to be going about around the world,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.560]  most of the people are complacent, and they just go along to get along. And they think,
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.600]  Well, we got to go help those people. We got to get rid of absolutely Congressman Ron Paul's
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.160]  our guest. I want to expand and flesh that out when we come back because that is so central.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.920]  Please stay with us. Ron Paul joins us. In the last two years alone, the US has seen
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.440]  huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the US costing us
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.960]  20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.480]  more than 50 years. You may think out of sight out of mind and so you don't think you will
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:23.360]  be affected. The fact is you are we all are food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.140]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.560]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:21.600]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:28.480]  Alright, I'm coming to you on the road up here in Dallas, Texas visiting family and
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.720]  Congressman Ron Paul joins us as well from Texas via the phone and we have our reporters
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:39.960]  riding shotgun with us and the former Congressman is just popping in with a news and analysis
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.560]  update here with us today and he's going to talk some about the homeschooling curriculum
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.480]  he's got coming out in September that is truly a revolutionary idea that I'm fully behind.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:54.480]  But first off, sir, seeing the images of lockdown saying it's a prison, overriding the Bill
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.240]  of Rights, that is martial law by definition and now they're saying this is the new way
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.480]  in America and we've got to have drones now domestically and that basically America is
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:09.880]  a battlefield. We've known this was coming along with the economic collapse that is centralization.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.480]  What can you say about what Americans can do to reverse this and your take on what you
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:20.720]  saw in Boston, former Congressman Ron Paul? Well, I think what Boston has told me is a
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:26.080]  bigger issue and more difficult to reverse than I might have hoped. I'm always hopeful.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.160]  I always want to be positive. I get a lot of people who understand and should do it,
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:36.440]  but to overcome the power of the Department of Homeland Security, I mean, it looks like
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.840]  they're going to have all the guns. At least they want to have all the guns. They're buying
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.800]  up all the ammunition, but of course they said they would never use it against American
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.400]  citizens. What are they doing? Then when you witness what went on in Boston, I mean, if
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.040]  this is not martial law, I don't know what martial law is going to look like, but the
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.280]  Constitution has been trampled. The American people have to stand up any way they know
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:06.440]  how to do it by spreading messages, reading, studying, getting involved in politics. Ultimately,
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:13.200]  though, it's education. People have to understand why liberty provides the answers for us, but
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.920]  we have been conditioned probably for 30 or 40 years, and you hear it all the time from
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:21.840]  the president, their job is to make us safe. One, the liberals say, we want to make you
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:26.720]  economically safe and secure, and nobody falls through the cracks and we're going to take
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.760]  care of everybody, but then others say we want to make you physically safe, and governments
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.120]  aren't supposed to do that. Governments are supposed to protect our liberties. Once they
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:41.800]  decide they're going to make us safe, economically and physically safe, they can only do this
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:47.240]  by taking away our liberties, and that's where we are. We seek safety rather than liberty,
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.320]  and we were warned about it, and I think we need to re-warn the American people, and they
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.840]  have to know what the goals are in order to establish their priorities.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:03.920]  Again, Dr. Ron Paul joins us. You talk about the bullets. We broke that story, Drudge Report
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.440]  forced it into the mainstream media, and they said, we're not buying bullets, and then they
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.040]  said, okay, we bought a billion, now it's two billion. And then they come out and say,
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.600]  it's a hoax that we're buying bullets, but we did buy bullets. So their lies, their denials
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.440]  have gotten schizophrenic where you're reading a headline, and they testify, this is a hoax,
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.360]  but we did buy the bullets.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.760]  And now she said before Congress today, big sis, that DHS denies ammo purchases aimed
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:36.080]  at civilians when the targets are of women and children on record, and the army manuals
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.000]  say they're training to take on domestic groups. That first document we got four years ago
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.200]  said Ron Paul, veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, Aaron Russo, film owners, I
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.920]  mean, just bizarre, and now all that is mainline. So what do you say about the intensified lying,
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.360]  or do you disagree, or are they not intensifying their lies?
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  Well, you know, they have the major medias on their side so they paint us as paranoid,
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.360]  and this is our job, whether it's talk shows like yours or our internet programs or whatever
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:13.600]  we're doing, we have to reverse this whole idea that we are paranoid and just imagining
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.280]  these things. When she gives us an inch and says, oh yeah, we did purchase them, they
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:23.320]  have to pound her and figure out, what are you going to do with them? What is the intent?
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:29.360]  How much money? You'd think Congress should have more of a backbone to stand up and demand
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.280]  this. That's their responsibility. The Congress goes along with it. They give up their prerogatives
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:42.040]  to the executive branch so easily, and if we don't do it, see, the people eventually
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.080]  have to do it. Members of Congress go along to get along. They've been doing that for
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.920]  years, so we only have a dozen or two up there that are trying, but what we need to do is
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:56.160]  wake up more and more people to hound their Congressman and say, find out why and what
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:02.960]  are they up to? Because it's only information that they have that can wake the people up.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:06.280]  If they don't get the information, they're going to be too complacent and then it'll
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:13.880]  be too late. After Boston, I worry more on where we are, but then again, when I go to
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.240]  the college campuses, I get good responses. A lot of young people are saying, you know,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.220]  we know what you're talking about and we don't like it, and we're going to be stuck with
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:26.880]  a big bill and we don't have a job. So there's a receptive ear out there, so it's a battle.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.800]  It's a battle for the hearts and minds of people to decide which they think is correct.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.840]  Are they going to go along with the status quo and the Federal Reserve and the income
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.920]  tax system and government taking care of us and make us safe and secure, or are we going
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.720]  to say it's time we defended our position that we want our freedoms back and just get
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.640]  the government out of the way? Well, as you said earlier, government claims
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.760]  that it's here to help us, but everywhere government gets involved, it creates dependency
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.040]  and just wrecks society. We've sent our reporters out in Austin, but also in California, not
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:03.200]  just in Texas, and the most people sign petitions to confiscate all the guns, to not just ban
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:08.960]  carbon dioxide, but dihydrogen monoxide or water. And it seems like you've got two things
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.400]  happening. Either people are getting more awake or they're getting even more dumbed
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.840]  down and they're saying, hey, we're a democracy, a 51% vote to make the other 49 slaves, we're
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.800]  going to do it. But in a republic that actually blocks them.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.760]  But the federal government's moving forward, like it's a democracy, they can do whatever
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:31.520]  they want. Do you see a collision, a clash of civilizations of informed, high IQ, productive
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:39.080]  good people that haven't succumbed to cultural collectivism and Marxism and globalism versus
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.440]  the zombie hordes? I mean, this is getting bad is my point.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:48.720]  I think there will be, will be this collision mainly because our country is bankrupt, but
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:56.560]  also there's more and more people waking up, which I think is very good and that's beneficial.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.960]  But the one thing though, individuals like myself who want to look on the positive side
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:09.240]  of the thing, we shouldn't ever get so naive as to think that we're up against a, an enemy
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:15.520]  that's rather a soft enemy. The worst things get, the harder they'll work and the more
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:21.400]  they'll do to cling to power under the pretense, of course, of always helping people. They've
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.280]  been powerful because they've always been to get them moral high ground. We're doing
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:31.240]  good. You know, we go over these countries, we want to get rid of bad dictators. Yes,
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:37.400]  we have deficits, but we take care of poor people, all of that. But now they're running
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.720]  out of money and they can't do it and they make these false promises. So the only thing
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.560]  left for them since their promises aren't believed anymore is they're going to use power.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.640]  And that's why you see the department of Homeland security and the FBI invoking martial laws
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:55.720]  in a, in a major city. So I think it'll get worse. I've always said it's going to get
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.920]  worse before it gets better because we haven't even had the big economic crisis that I think
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.160]  is coming. And then you wonder how complacent the American people will be. So the more people
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.120]  we can alert to being prepared for this so they can handle some of the emergencies to
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.520]  get by, the better off we'll be. So we want everybody to be protected as many as possible
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.320]  so they don't have to depend on the government. But when the government's broke, they have
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.600]  very little to promise except our might to try to restore order.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.500]  Absolutely. And so it's a sign of their weakness that they're trying to flex their muscles
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:35.840]  and use any excuse to take over and plant the flag of authoritarianism on our once great
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:41.000]  Republic because they understand and they're scared and they know they've mismanaged things.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.940]  Now, now shifting gears into a subject that so many callers when they heard you were coming
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:49.800]  on the last few days, wanted me to ask you just as a layman here and, and, and, and working
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.600]  with a gold and silver company like Minus Resources, they, they're having trouble getting
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:59.020]  the gold that's being bought so quick. Places are sold out everywhere. The mint can't even
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:04.760]  make enough, but they're using paper money to drive down the price while elites are buying
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.560]  it as fast as they can. What do you make of what's happening with the war on gold?
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:15.000]  Well, I think, I think there is, and governments always have a war on gold because they want
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.480]  their paper to last as long as possible. They did that. How much gold do you think we dumped
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.560]  in the fifties and the sixties at $35 an ounce trying to prove that point? Markets though
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:31.400]  eventually went out. So I think that they very well could be involved in all this dumping
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:36.720]  of gold that, you know, that one day when the gold prices went down so much, there were
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.520]  53,000 contracts sold by one individual. I just wonder how close the treasury department
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:50.440]  was to that. But the market number that best tells you about this disconnect is the premium
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:57.880]  on the coin. So you and I might hear, oh yeah, gold prices are crashing and well, maybe we
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.840]  ought to buy some more. So we go out. Evidently there was more than just a couple of us doing
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.280]  that. Quite a few went out. So the premium goes up, which is natural. That's the way
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.720]  the market works. The price is not supposed to be going up because the price is so-called
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.960]  fixed by these traders in the paper market. But the premium is part of the price. And
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.440]  the price was, I don't know what the premium has done in the last day or two, but I know
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.920]  when it was, when the price of gold was going down rapidly, the premiums went up, which
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.640]  meant they were- But that's like Nixon price fixing. Sure. But isn't it like Nixonian price
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.160]  fixing? I mean, sure he can fix the price, but then you can't find, you know, the things
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.080]  that they fixed the price on. What I'm saying is I'm getting reports everywhere that people,
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:44.600]  the shops, they can't get the gold, that there's a major shortage at this lower price. So doesn't
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.480]  that right there prove that the market is saying gold is really worth a lot more? And
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.940]  as you said, they can't suppress it forever. Shifting gears. What about Bitcoin? I've been
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.640]  leery day one because if this wasn't something globalists were involved in, they would have
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:03.880]  destroyed it. Now they're not all powerful, but I just have a bad feeling. Well, I don't
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:11.000]  know exactly what's going on there. I have deep reservations about it because my understanding
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.320]  of money is a little bit different than something that comes out of a computer, and I don't
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.120]  understand how it's calculated. I don't think anybody else does. But if we have a truly
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.960]  free society and people are doing this and they're not committing fraud and it actually
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:33.280]  is a, it becomes a means of exchange and people can transfer and measure things in a Bitcoin,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:38.680]  you know, I'm not going to object to that, but I don't think that is the answer. I think
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:44.200]  money has to be something that has been established in the marketplace and there's been a pretty
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:50.380]  good test on gold and silver, like thousands of years. So I'm very reluctant to get involved
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:55.400]  in even the Bitcoin, you know, it's going to be, when you make a sale or a purchase
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.840]  in Bitcoin, you have to, you know, do the mathematical change and figure, oh, how much
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.360]  is, how many dollars am I getting for this? But I hope it's a method where they're challenging
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:12.320]  because that's been one of my positions is that if we would just have a legal competition
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.300]  with the Federal Reserve in place, this would be helpful. But I'm thinking more along the
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:22.780]  lines of somebody who's out there using gold and silver as legal tender as advocated under
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:27.800]  the Constitution. But you know what happens to people who do that. You can go to prison
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:32.160]  for that. You're called a counterfeiter, but the Federal Reserve should be the ones that
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.760]  be held responsible for counterfeiting.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.480]  All right, I want to get into homeschooling and then let you get out of here. But last
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:43.800]  question before we get to that, I want to bring up Boston again, because the government
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.560]  locked down the city and then couldn't find the guy. And then as soon as they lifted the
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.600]  lockdown, which is totally illegal, then a citizen smoking a cigarette out back his house
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.520]  saw the guy was in the boat. I mean, not only did it not protect us, it's totally unconstitutional,
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.640]  but it's just all a giant fraud.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.980]  What would you do down there where you live in South Texas on the coast if they said don't
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:10.820]  come out of your house today or will arrest you? Or what would you do if you drove up
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:16.440]  and they had your family with hands up? I mean, this is a big deal. They need to get
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.500]  in trouble. Do you have any ideas as a constitutionalist and a pretty smart guy how we could take
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.720]  action against this precedent setting garbage?
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.480]  That's a tough one because they're the ones who are using violence illegally against the
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:35.040]  people. And to resist it, of course, that's armed conflict. And it's how much how much
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:41.140]  of a stomach do you have for the confrontation? But what we have to do is intellectually argue
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:48.440]  against and expose those people who have these lockdowns and and having martial law declared
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.720]  because three people were killed, which was tragic. But what about every night? I think
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:58.720]  every day there's about 48 murders every day. Sometimes on a weekend, they'll be 10 in one
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:08.180]  city. They never locked down a city. So this is exactly unprecedented. Very, very dangerous.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.560]  We have to expose them every chance we get.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.000]  Sure. I mean, they've had lone gunmen out all the time. You don't lock down a whole
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.320]  city. If they said, hey, please stay in your homes in this block. We think he's in one
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.480]  of your houses. That would be, you know, kind of a probable cause, at least, you know, something
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.360]  reasonable suspicion. But I mean, just you're all locked in your house and now we're going
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.720]  to aim guns at you. I mean, little kids in yards, they name guns at them. I can't wait
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.460]  to get you on in September because this is revolutionary idea to get out of the government
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.460]  training camp.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:40.400]  Spend a few minutes, sir. And the time we've got left here telling us the best websites
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:45.800]  to visit, where we should go to find out about this. Hopefully you'll get your your site
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:51.280]  back soon. RonPaul.com. But what are the best sites to visit and why have you launched this
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.280]  homeschooling initiative?
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:58.200]  Of course, homeschooling is something I've been very sympathetic with for many, many
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.760]  years, more so every year, because I think the public educational system is deteriorating.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.960]  I've talked about it before, but in Congress, you can't really do a whole lot. Even 20,
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:12.120]  30 years ago, I've often thought to myself, you know, it'd be neat to have a school when
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.800]  I'm out of Congress, but I always thought about brick and mortar school. But technology
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:22.040]  has changed and all of a sudden, you know, there's a much bigger opportunity to have
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:29.160]  more students at a much cheaper price, have good education, have it, you know, where it's
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:37.000]  not very expensive. So I've had some help with this. Tom Woods and Gary North have been
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.480]  working with me on this, and they are great at teaching, and we're going to have math
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:50.360]  courses in science and history and English. And also, you know, the first six grades are
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:57.160]  going to be free. You can go and get on there after September and get education, first six
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:04.240]  grades, for free. And then the later grades, there will be tuition charges. But one other
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.680]  unique thing that we've come up with on this, where it's different, there are a lot of homeschooling
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.320]  programs and they're not, you know, a lot of them are very decent, all but ours will
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:21.760]  be somewhat unique. But there's going to be a lot of interplay between students and self-teaching.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.880]  And also, it means that the costs will go down because we're not going to have people
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.360]  buying books. They can if they want, but we want to pay the cost down. So if we have a
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:40.600]  course on the Constitution, it's going to be done by reading the Constitution and the
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:46.720]  Federalist Papers and then having a teacher giving a lecture and the students writing.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.040]  So it would be a little bit different approach. We think we can give everybody a better education
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.280]  at a much better price than anything that's out there right now.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.120]  And again, what are the best sites other than Campaign for Liberty for people to visit right
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.120]  now to find everything?
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.000]  Well, this one in particular is RonPaulCurriculum.com. And there's a preliminary course you can sign
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:16.280]  up for $25 to help you get into, you know, preparing for high school. But the curriculum
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.840]  really gets started in September. But there is a web page now that gives you some information
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.640]  and it will keep you up to date on. There's a question and answer section on there where
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640]  people call.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.080]  Sure, my wife did it. We printed it off. It's excellent. Let me just say this, then I'll
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.960]  let you get out of here as you got to go. You know, when I first talked to you before
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.760]  you went live on air, you know, we were talking about promoting and how important it is. And
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.920]  you were talking about how it's free for people to the first six grades and then almost apologizing
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:48.700]  for selling it. Listen, we have gotten a liberty movement to fund each other and to vote with
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:52.800]  our dollars. And we'll take the economy back, as you know, through markets.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.640]  It's time, you know, the media attacks us, the establishment that lives off our tax money
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.300]  and corporate welfare that you sell a book or I sell a film. Ladies and gentlemen, you
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:06.720]  either spend your money with websites like DrudgeReport.com, clicking on the sponsors,
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.520]  Ron Paul sites, my sites, you spread the word about us or we're done. OK, this is war bonds.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:18.440]  Ron Paul, you know, lives in a modest house, can sail off of the sunset. He's at 76 years
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.520]  old or whatever it is, fighting every day because he has a passion for liberty against
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.080]  the authoritarians. And this is a revolutionary act, taking our kids back from the scum. So,
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:33.380]  sir, I'm going to get behind your curriculum and I salute you when it comes out in September.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.680]  Everybody should buy it and give it to their family members if they won't buy it. Everybody
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:43.560]  should support this 110 percent, Congressman. Wonderful. It's good being with you today.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.080]  Thank you so much. We'll talk to you soon. All right. There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.120]  I mean, it's bottom line, bottom line. I'm ready to die for freedom. OK, I'm in the globalist
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.400]  face saying I want you going down one hundred and ten percent. I'll tell you why I like
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.600]  to oblivion so much, because that's what it's all about, that archetype of giving your life
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.600]  up for liberty.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.420]  And I don't want to die. But you know what? I love liberty so much. I'm not afraid of
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.520]  them, even though I know how horrible they are. I know the things they could do every
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.880]  time I look at my children and know they could come after them and they threaten my family.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:18.660]  I just look at them and I commit. And, you know, I'm a slob on air half the time. I'm
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:24.600]  burnt out, ladies and gentlemen. I cannot unplug. I dream about this stuff. I can't
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.800]  play outside with my kids or go fishing. All I'm thinking about is news and the New World
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]  Order.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.360]  And then I do so much research, I get on air and can't even talk about it all because I
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.880]  just know too much. I mean, it's like the Gnarls Barkley song. I want to come back out
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.440]  of break with that, with our guests, because it's you know, I'm not crazy because I didn't
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.000]  know enough. It's because I knew too much. And I just was talking to Ron Paul during
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.560]  the break and he's like, and yeah, you know, we're selling it because, you know, we have
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.040]  to pay for it and everything.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:55.560]  And I'm like, I was like, man, don't apologize that you're selling it. I mean, the globalists
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:00.480]  have taken over and control the issuance of currency and credit. OK, we're doing this
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.960]  because we love liberty and want to be free. And then they create this idea like he said
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.680]  that they have the moral authority. They can sell stuff. They can make us give them our
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:14.280]  money to then use against us. And that's moral. And then we, oh, Alex Jones, you know, I had
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:20.040]  the Austin police chief and he's like, oh, Alex Jones, Alex Jones is selling stuff. Alex
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:26.120]  Jones has got a 50 caliber rifle. Yeah. And I'll sell my house and a little bit of real
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.320]  estate I've got and all my guns, if I ever have to, to keep them for Wars Dotcom going,
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:36.080]  I will live in a rat infested trailer before I ever stop spending my money on fighting
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.440]  the New World Order. But yeah, I like nice things. I like being comfortable. But that's
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.960]  not my God. You see, my God is God is liberty and his life and his freedom. That's why I
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.440]  take the money you give us by buying the great products we promote and hire more reporters
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.560]  and get better equipment and building studios.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.120]  I have a dream to bring these people down. I'm a builder. I want to build things. I want
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.600]  to construct things. I want to build an architecture of freedom. I want to lead the way out of
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.480]  this with you right beside me and in front of me and behind me. This is I have a dream
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:10.800]  of liberty. I have a dream of freedom. I have a dream of my children not being slaves. And
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.840]  I am sick of the globalists having the moral high ground while they use our tax money against
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.320]  us that we're not supposed to sell stuff.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.000]  I don't even I skip this network commercial. You know how much money that costs the network?
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.280]  I can't. Nothing they can do because I just won't be on the network if they try to stop
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.040]  me. And it's bad that I do it. I don't even plug products here on air like I should buy
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.280]  everything at info wars dot com info war store dot com.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.560]  Buy the water filters, buy the seeds, buy the T-shirts, buy the videos. It's all about

[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:09.040]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind. There was something so pleasant
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:21.040]  about that place. Even your emotions have an echo and so much space. And when you're
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:28.040]  out there without care, yeah, I was out of time. But it wasn't because I didn't know
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:36.040]  enough. I knew too much. I just knew too much. Does that make me crazy that I predicted everything
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:41.040]  would happen with the bombing? The first five minutes after it was announced. Does that
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:54.540]  make me crazy? Crank this back up for a minute. Does that make me crazy? Possibly. Man, I
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:58.880]  feel sorry for people that don't know how the world works. I want the whole universe
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:03.520]  to open up to everybody. It's all right there. You can read the philosophy, the history books,
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.840]  and you're going to be reading what men and women read and what men and women thought
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.440]  hundreds of years ago, thousands of years ago, and you're going to read thoughts you've
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:19.160]  had independently yourself and have that kinship through time with people who discovered beauty,
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:23.640]  loved beauty, loved kinship, honor, all the things that are good. You're not going to
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:29.760]  find that through this new world order culture because it cannot give you anything good because
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.760]  if you get something good, you're going to grow and develop like a healthy tree that
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:37.840]  will bear fruit of a free society.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.860]  They don't want that. They want to be in charge and do bad things. And to do that, they've
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:49.100]  got to dumb you down. But what is going to stop them is courage. And Cebel Edmonds was
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:55.960]  an FBI high security clearance translator. And because she can speak Arabic and several
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.360]  other languages, and she was listening before, during, and after 9-11, and she went to Congress,
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.880]  told them what she knew, and they gagged her. She pretty much broke the gag order. Incredible
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.080]  courage. You've seen the persecution of whistleblowers the last few years who even exposed crime,
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:18.040]  and they basically threatened her and things, but she hasn't been thrown in jail.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:21.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, it takes a lot of courage to go up against these people. Most men I
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.960]  know will not do it. They won't even admit this is going on, but Cebel Edmonds did that.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.520]  We'll give you her website. I'm on the road. I'm pulling up a story she really wants us
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:34.680]  to look at, so we'll let her break down here. We've got Riding Shotgun, Ja'Carri Jackson
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:38.100]  and David Knight. They'll be hosting the whole next hour, and they're going to have Syrian
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.320]  Girl on, breaking down the fact they're trying to frame them for chemical weapons.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:47.120]  But I have to say to Cebel, because I heard her on TV a few days ago, or saw her on TV,
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.880]  we linked to it from RT with Abby Martin, excellent piece, going over the fact that
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.160]  this could be a false flag, could be. I mean, knowing what she knows, I'm not going to recap
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.480]  it all, but we know the FBI, CIA was on these guys for five years.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:06.160]  It's now confirmed mainstream news in Europe, in Russia, that he was in a CIA sponsored
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:11.680]  Zbigniew Brzezinski program to undermine the caucuses where they're putting Al Qaeda in.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.200]  This is a total setup, and this is a message to all the patsies out there. People that
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.640]  think you're part of national security stuff, you're playing the part of a terrorist to
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.240]  infiltrate groups, you're going to be set up a lot of times.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.560]  And the little brother was just tagging along. He was partying the night before, he had no
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.280]  idea. They've cut his throat out. He climbed out of the boat and they tried to kill him.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.240]  He's been told, you're dead if you don't play ball. Same thing happened with McVeigh. They
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:39.240]  do the same thing over and over again. That's how I'm able to tell you what's going to happen.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.800]  I had Richard Belzer on when it was announced, and I said, there'll be a drill, the people
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.680]  will be handled, they'll set up patsies that openly work for intelligence groups.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.760]  People are like, how did you know this Jones? People are so freaked out right now. They're
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:55.480]  saying, you know, that Jones must be a government agent or something. Well, if I am a government
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.080]  agent, we need more like me. No, I'm not. I'm a Liberty lover who studied what they
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:04.080]  do. It's so pathological. Now, Sebelle Edmonds has been a total insider and a real government
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.500]  agent that went public.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.700]  And she has a news website that we're going to put on screen for TV viewers and let her
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:15.320]  plug here on air. But Sebelle, I want you to take the floor here. Then my reporters
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.900]  have a few questions for you at the next segment and talk about your case briefly to recap
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:23.680]  it. And then what did you think the minute you saw the Boston bombing? Because I know
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:29.480]  being a false flag expert, someone who's covered it for 15, 16 years, actually longer than
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.080]  that, but I really been on it since Oklahoma city.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.560]  So I guess 18 years, this is like flashbacks for me. It's very painful. I wish this wasn't
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:42.080]  an inside job because that's a lot less scary than, you know, to have a few lone nuts out
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.640]  there than to know that the system is this corrupt. And then why would they do it a Sebelle?
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.440]  Hi, Alex. Good to be with you again. And as far as my case is concerned, I'm not going
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.400]  to get into the civil liberties and the details of my case, but I want to emphasize the fact
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.400]  that since my case broke in 2002, with all the state secrets, privilege, and gag orders,
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:11.160]  I have been emphasizing the gifts, the reason for the state secrets, privilege, and also
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:17.440]  the gag orders being our operation. And this is us, the United States government's operations
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:24.040]  in central Asia and caucuses, some direct operations also through proxy nations, such
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:31.000]  as NATO member, Turkey in this region. And that includes all the stands, you know, Kyrgyzstan,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:39.240]  Kazakhstan, but also in the caucuses, Chechnya, Dagestan. And so this has been pretty much
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:47.200]  a consistent theme for the past 10 years with my case. And every time I have given an interview
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:53.040]  or talk about it, people go like, oh, stands, central Asia, caucuses, even people-
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.340]  No, you always bring that up because that's what you were listening to. And this is part
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:03.280]  of the public program in that red crescent to destabilize that. This is a public program.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.000]  What is incredible is that it's all public, but the public's so ignorant, it's like we're
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  speaking Martian.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.940]  Oh, well, a lot of it, Alex, you say is public info, but the mainstream media has really
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:20.480]  never ever, ever covered this. And a lot of the pseudo alternatives that you know about,
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.480]  I know about, our listeners know about, they never touch these regions, but now lo and
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:32.800]  behold with this incident in Boston, suddenly it put this region, the caucuses, Chechnya
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:38.240]  and Dagestan on the map. You know, these people went from freedom fighter rebels overnight
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:45.400]  with Boston incidents into the hottest terrorist cell, hottest al-Qaeda terror cell, hottest
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.360]  Islamic radical cell, parroting each other, getting their script from the State Department,
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.880]  from the CIA, especially the New York Times and LA Times, Washington Post.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.680]  But also to a certain degree, a lot of these quasi alternative media. And I know a lot
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:07.840]  of people, they got bogged down with all these ever changing, ever conflicted, contradictory
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.600]  semantics and details.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.200]  The bottom line is these guys were working for Western intelligence. The Russians blew
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  their cover. For people that don't know, you've been saying publicly for 10 years since you
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:22.140]  broke the gag order with a lot of courage, as I said earlier, that it was a crime network
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:30.520]  from Central Asia, right through the stands, right into the caucuses, right into Albania,
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.280]  right into Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, right into.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:37.600]  So explain the big picture because you were on the inside listening to all this. Explain
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.320]  to people what's happening here on the Brzezinski Grand Chessboard and then how that fits into
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.320]  these brothers.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:49.040]  Sure. So as I was saying, while people were bogged down with all these ever changing information,
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.720]  which is in a way, it's a matter of distraction. People, you know, making a lot of, you know,
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.560]  putting out a lot of hypothesis and talking about some details on the ground. We came
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.280]  out as boiling frogs post and we talked about the bigger picture. And that's exactly what
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.880]  the US government, that's what exactly the mainstream media don't want people to look
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:14.420]  at to step back and look at the big picture. Number one, the fact that they were from this
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:20.080]  region with connections to Chechnya, Dagestan, these are not even nations. These are regions
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:26.720]  within Russian territory and Russia. And the other thing I talked about, of course, the
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.440]  interview you referred to was a good interview with Abby Martin, but was very short, so I
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.920]  really couldn't get into it. And that's why we have a much longer interview from five
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.280]  days before that on our website. When I get to explain, for example, one of the things
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:45.240]  that keep coming out of the parents for the suspects were that, you know, this thing dated
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.200]  back to three to five years ago. And while FBI was talking about two years, you know,
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.200]  Russians notifying the FBI at the end of 2011. The other inconsistency that is very important
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.920]  and I'm going to link it to this great game in a second had to do with the style that
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:05.480]  the parents were talking about, the style of the communication relationship of these
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.940]  government officials with the suspects. Right away, I said, first of all, that seems to
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:15.640]  be the recruitment style, you know, especially if it dated three to five years ago. And considering
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:21.200]  these guys, especially the older brothers' language, linguistic skills, you know, he
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.200]  speaks Russian, Chechen, the Turkic language and English, he still holds his passport.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.280]  Yeah, for people that don't know, they come to like, you know, they come to people when
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.720]  they're like 16, 17, 18. This is five years ago and say, you are powerful. You're a leader.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.240]  The CIA needs you to infiltrate these groups. So you get these parting animals suddenly
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.360]  are going to mosque saying, I want to blow everyone up there. They think they're finding
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.400]  radical Muslims, but really they're creating the ledger in the history to be set up.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.360]  Well, I would be careful to characterize it as infiltrating because when you're talking
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.680]  about these groups, Alex, and this goes to my case and this goes to what I've been referring
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:00.680]  to for the past 11 years. Well, these groups are our groups. We, the United States created
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.680]  these groups, OK?
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.200]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I totally agree with you. It's on record. The State
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.920]  Department runs the Islamic terror groups, all of them in the stands. You're the expert.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:14.020]  But I mean, that's all admitted. You're misunderstanding. I'm saying when they sent the brothers around
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:18.620]  to shoot their mouths off at mosque about how they, you know, how they hate America
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:24.720]  and stuff, and then they go party at the dorm at night, that is clearly them thinking their
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:30.000]  agents infiltrating radical groups, is what I'm saying, when in truth they're creating
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.320]  their history, their ledger to be set up later.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.280]  No, I understand. And one of the other thing I need to emphasize right here at this point
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.240]  is initially when the report came out, there were a lot of people who said, well, these
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:48.520]  guys only associated with modern, you know, wealthy Turkish students and businessmen there.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:54.560]  And we didn't see any signs of radicalization. They were hanging out in BMWs, going to nightclubs
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.360]  and now you're referring to this thing of some of these people coming and saying this
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:04.200]  is what they said in the mosque. That's why I haven't been really covering all these changing
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:10.120]  contradictory details, because after you can get a lot of people. Exactly. You're right
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.760]  to come and say, OK, then I'm going to shut up. Here's what I'm going to do. Then you've
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:19.600]  got the floor. What is the core of this and what people need to know? Go ahead. Well,
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:23.800]  Alex, this really makes me feel special. You're giving me the floor. I'm really honored. Thank
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:31.800]  you. So what I pointed out, the fact that, OK, these people are exact profile that CIA
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:37.080]  seeks, especially in the United States. We don't have many people from caucuses. So the
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.440]  older brother is a perfect operative for the CIA to recruit. That was the number one thing
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.280]  we put out through our Web site and say nobody's talking about the CIA connection. Everybody's
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:52.360]  putting the focus on FBI. And and I believe that the Russians did, in fact, contact the
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:58.040]  FBI at the end of 2011. FBI went there. They came back and they were told by the CIA to
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:05.080]  butt out, to zip and not to close the case, because while I was working at the FBI with
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:10.920]  the agents on these operations, this was a recurring theme. Alex, we would have a lot
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:16.240]  of investigations. We would open up. We would, you know, pursue suspects. And lo and behold,
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:20.240]  either the State Department and again, I have been saying this for 11 years or CIA would
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:25.720]  step in and would pressure the SES level people, the top tier level people of the FBI to shut
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:31.640]  down the investigations, to close the investigations, because whatever we were looking at or whoever
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.280]  we were looking at happened to be our guys from the CIA and State Department side. So
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:44.760]  and this went to a lot of 9-11 related cases where we had actively, just in my own department
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:49.320]  alone, several cases where the CIA came and said, you're going to shut these investigations
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:54.720]  and you're not going to pursue this person. Or actually CIA facilitated the suspect's
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.140]  exit from the country, from the United States immediately, weeks after 9-11. So that was
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:06.140]  very similar. The other thing that I kept telling people to look at is what is going
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:13.280]  to happen immediately after this terror incident, the so-called scripted terror incident. I
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.960]  said, watch three areas very carefully and this is what you're going to be seeing. And
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:22.800]  guess what? In the past two days, what we put out a week ago saying this is what's going
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:29.040]  to take place is already in effect, it's already taking place. Number one, I said, well, the
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.500]  biggest obstacle for us to go and actually directly invade Syria because we have the
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:39.520]  military power. We can take it, we can take them out in two days. Okay. Go to Syria and
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:45.560]  get rid of Assad and do this and finish it. Invade Allah Libya, you know, Allah Egypt.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:52.400]  I said, the only obstacle has been Russia. Now with this connection, suddenly we changing
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:57.840]  hats saying, well, these guys that we created for a while, we are going to declare them
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:03.240]  the terrorists, the hot Al Qaeda cell. Look, again, we have done this throughout the history
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:10.160]  with Mujahideen that we created Al Qaeda bin Laden in Afghanistan. At some points they
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.400]  were our freedom fighters. They were our guys. At some point they were terrorists. And sometimes
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:21.200]  we do it several times. KLA, okay. In the Balkans with Albanians, we deeply, we have
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.520]  KLAs under terrorists category with the state department. Then during the Balkan war, we
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:31.240]  made them the freedom fighters, our allies. We list that terrorist titles. And then after
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:36.840]  we were finished, we were done. We put that title back again. We do this a lot with, and
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:43.800]  same thing with MEK, the Mujahideen. Some people refer to them as MKO. Now look at Chechens,
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.960]  right? Suddenly Chechens are the terrorists and all these bad guys. Do you know who's
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:53.920]  the biggest lobby for the Chechens? In several years ago, they established a Chechen lobby.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:48:00.800]  Guess who established it? James Woolsey, ex CIA director, Michael Ledeen, Frank Gaffney,
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.120]  Richard, Richard Pearl. When you look at the names of these lobbyists that set up this,
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:10.920]  uh, the committee for peace in Chechnya. Okay. The American committee for peace in Chechnya,
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:16.800]  that lobby group for Chechens, you're looking at all the infamous CIA, DIA Pentagon, and
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:22.400]  the Neocons. Okay. Later, after it got a little bit of scandalous, they changed the Chechnya
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:29.120]  in the title into caucuses. The American committee for peace in caucuses, right? This is not
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.800]  even a nation we are talking about, Chechnya. And now we have this big group, lobby group
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:40.360]  with all the CIA and Neocon guys for Chechnya and Chechens. People have to ask this. So
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:45.920]  this is what, you know, what happens now. I pointed out that there is a possibility
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:54.400]  that we made a backdoor deal with the Russians. Okay. Look, step aside and let us go and invade
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:00.280]  Syria directly. Okay. For a while, we'll declare the Chechen and these guys in Dagestan as
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:06.000]  the most radical Al Qaeda terrorists. Overnight. Okay. We'll set it up. We'll script it for
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.640]  you and we'll give you the free hand because Russia has been pretty much wary of really
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.560]  tackling some of these styles within its own regions. Because if you look at the map, you
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:22.880]  see that the region is very close, right on the border of Georgia. Now recall that conflict
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:30.080]  in 2008, the five day war with it being Georgia and Russia. So it's a very volatile region.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:34.560]  Plus Russia, people are like, well, Russia doesn't need permission from the United States,
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.720]  but you have to look at the geopolitics and you'll need the political cover. They need
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:44.000]  the political cover. Look, Russia doesn't want that kind of a bad rep in the EU. The
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.880]  United States has looked Russia is repressing these minorities. They're committing genocide.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.260]  So they have been kind of wary even though their intelligence have all the stuff information
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.900]  on these cells. Let me just throw this question at you and then we can come back and you can
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:01.860]  have the floor continually and finish up these important points you're making. Why would
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:06.640]  then the Georgian government, along with the Russians, release their military, the documents
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:12.480]  that he's at the CIA, Jamestown funded, Wolsey controlled, Zbigniew Brzezinski controlled
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.400]  meetings. Why would Georgia, I know it's moving a little bit away from the West now, but why
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:23.600]  would Georgia do that? I mean, they're obviously upset about this. What does it signify?
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.800]  Because we produced this video report and now our in-depth interview on this. And during
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:34.760]  this interview, uh, I pounded the issue and I said, I'm really asking for some factions
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:40.480]  within the Russian government intelligence and Georgia to put out information because
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.840]  their intelligence for years, for more than two decades, have been collecting all our
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.840]  operations.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:53.040]  Wow. You didn't do that. Absolutely. So stay there. Great, great. Stay there. She, Mel,
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:56.000]  we got to go to break. It's a hard break. We're gonna come back and recap what you were

[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:08.120]  in the shape that nature gave them. If they are to be used to create new proteins in your
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.880]  body, just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:18.120]  too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins. Giving your body
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.860]  an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health. One World Way is
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:28.760]  an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other. You see, heating bends and twists amino acids

[01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:13.720]  or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:24.920]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I'm going to punch out here in about five
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.760]  minutes because I'm on the road. I'll be live Sunday and I'll be live next Monday as well
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.080]  for part of the show. And you're going to have Gerald Cilente co-hosting with the guys.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.680]  But in this five-minute segment, C. Bell Edmonds is here. And then she'll do five minutes in
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:43.880]  the next hour with the other host. She can continue with what she's breaking down. And
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:48.080]  then Jakari Jackson and David Knight will continue to host into the third hour. But
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.040]  again, kind of an overall news transmission here. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.280]  and I'm Alex Jones. All right, C. Bell, you got cut off by the break there. You were getting
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.400]  to a central point that a week or so ago, when I've seen the video up on your Boiling
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:08.120]  Frogs website, be sure and give that full URL out, that you did call for these other
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:12.800]  intelligence agencies to go public. I was just shocked at Georgia, and it probably was
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:16.760]  you, because you're well respected worldwide, that Georgia would actually go, yeah, here's
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:21.400]  the right thing. These guys were CIA. But it's got a grind on people in intelligence
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:27.640]  agencies who aren't pure evil, like you, when you're working at the FBI, to just watch the
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.200]  bin Laden working for the CIA.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:34.360]  You're sitting there listening to it. And they're running drugs, you name it, weapons.
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:37.680]  So this is about a five-minute segment left. Continue making the central point you were
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.680]  getting to.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:46.320]  Right, so the back deal would be, okay, now with this incident, suddenly we have Chechens
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:54.160]  and these factions within the region, caucuses, going from freedom fighters to hot terrorists,
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:59.160]  Al Qaeda-linked terrorists, and in return for Russia to have free hand to go and do
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:05.160]  a major house cleanup, which it hasn't been doing for a while. I'm talking about massive
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:10.840]  operations and going to the region, even though these people are our people that we planted.
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.800]  We do this all the time. This is-
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.800]  And that's how diplomacy works. We'll take our missiles out if you take your missiles
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.800]  out or we'll let you kill our spies if you let us kill your spies.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.160]  Right, Alex. And instead of the international communities vilifying Russia, they will be
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.360]  clapping and saying, look, Boston thing happened. We already declared them. We already portrayed
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:35.760]  mainstream media running the scripts from the State Department as terrorists. So the
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:41.240]  international community is gonna be supporting, especially the United States and EU, Russia's
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:49.360]  coming crackdown, right? And as part of that, we are going to go and invade Syria. Guess
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:53.960]  what? We put this information, this analysis out. That interview, I encourage people to
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:57:00.340]  go and watch that video report at Boiling Frogs post. It's 45 minutes and this we put
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:05.200]  out about a week ago and it basically aces in every single point.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:12.600]  So now they're saying Syria has chemical weapons. We have Syria WMD al al-Qaeda, I mean, al-Iraq,
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.640]  okay? Bam, it came out yesterday, all right? Two, you look at the breaking news. Russia
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:25.640]  rounded up 140 people of caucus radical Islamic terrorists. That's breaking news currently
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:32.240]  right now as we speak, first page of Russia Today's channel. So everything that we predicted
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:38.800]  is basically taking place. Now you compare that to the mainstream media and the alternatives
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:44.360]  that have gotten bogged down in the semantics and some details, some ridiculous stuff. As
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.520]  it happened with 9-11, they basically lose the entire picture.
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.760]  Instead of looking at the big picture, they are looking at little fragments. And I understand
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:58:00.040]  as far as investigative approach goes, people can get clues and put together. But the clues
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:04.040]  they are giving you, the mainstream media and government, they are not clues. This is
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:11.720]  as you just talked about, contradictory, conflicting, a lot of them false, ever changing, evolving,
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:12.720]  devolving.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:18.280]  Rather than doing that, we have been presenting the bigger picture and the Boston terror incident
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:23.480]  basically facilitated what we are seeing right now and what we're going to be.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.880]  See, Mel, we got to go to break. We're going to come back and do a little bit more time
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.300]  with you. And I'd like to invite you on the nightly news. I like to have my crew either
[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:35.000]  today or Monday show those clips because you did absolutely call it. You are absolutely
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  right. There's no doubt the globalists run Al-Qaeda. This is a staged event, period.

[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:17.240]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.220]  of government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles

[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:18.760]  want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:27.600]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, I'm going to punch out of here and she'll
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:32.120]  be able to be here until about 15 after. She's doing like an hour with us on Monday during
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:34.600]  the Infowars. Not only knows, I think it's David Knight doing it. We're going to show
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.360]  the Brzezinski documents, where they lay all this out, this plan in 1979 where they've
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:42.880]  made public statements since then. That's why she's so frustrated. I can hear it in
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.880]  her voice. It's all laid out. It's all admitted. The globalists run Al-Qaeda. They created
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:51.800]  it. They're giving them Libya and Syria. They'll say Iran is Al-Qaeda, even though it's Shiites.
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:58.340]  They just have, Muslims are bad. Let's blow up Syria. 9-11, let's blow up Iraq. That's
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:02.560]  how dumb they think you are. And so she'll be with us this little segment about five
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:06.360]  minutes into the next. But next Monday, I want to have the crew get clips from the video
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.320]  she talked about at her Boiling Frogs post, where a week before all this came out, she
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:16.920]  laid it out. Because she was an insider for years listening to this in the caucuses, into
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:23.420]  the stands, and she knows. I mean, it's all run by the CIA. It's all run by the globalists.
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:27.120]  So she'll finish up, you've got the floor, then the guys will take you out to break and
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.360]  interview you in the next segment. And then they've got Syrian girl on to expose it from
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:39.040]  another perspective. But this is just really incredible. Well, go ahead and finish up.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:44.600]  Yeah. Yes. So as I was saying with this now, we are going to see a big time international
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:55.240]  plot for Russia starting this crackdown on operations with the factions in Chechnya and
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:02:00.760]  in Dagestan region. And again, we need to also watch Georgia very, very closely with
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:08.240]  this because about a week before, 10 days before Boston terrorist event, Russia sent
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:15.920]  the United States a very strong, also simultaneously cryptic message saying, we really don't like
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:21.000]  what you have been doing with Georgia. And that is Georgia is in line to become a NATO
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:29.080]  member. And we had this joint exercise, military exercise with Georgia right there on the border.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:33.200]  And again, if you go to the map and you look at Georgia's borders, what you're going to
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:39.400]  see is you're going to see Dagestan and Chechnya, exactly the region that suddenly became the
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:46.680]  hot region after the incident. So that's extremely important too. As far as Iran goes, I haven't
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:52.040]  put that analysis out. It's going to come out on Monday. I believe as part of this back
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:56.560]  deal with Russia, we are going to put this whole Iran situation on hold. We're going
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:01.840]  to hear a lot of more of these talks with the United Nations and nothing is going to
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:07.240]  happen on Iran. At least I would say for a year or longer. However, in the next couple
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:12.640]  of weeks, you're going to see the finish job with Syria and you're going to see further
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:20.600]  internal domestic crackdown from Russia towards the factions in Dagestan and Chechnya. And
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:26.040]  one other thing I want to talk about, I haven't talked about it before, but for the past several
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:31.440]  years, what I have been getting both from my sources in Turkey, but also some intelligence
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:37.680]  sources here has been the fact that Zawahiri, Ayman Zawahiri has also been in this region.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.760]  He is not in Pakistan. He hasn't been residing in Pakistan. And here's one prediction. I'm
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.880]  going to make a hypothesis. I'm not calling it a theory at this point. The hypothesis
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:55.560]  I'm going to put forward here is we will be hearing about Zawahiri and pursuit of Zawahiri
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:00.320]  in the region, which again, as they laid the ground with the Boston incident, they made
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:06.400]  it the hot terror cell. And we're going to be hearing U.S. pursuing Zawahiri in the region.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.480]  And I'm saying it today on April 26th here on your show, during your show, Alex.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:15.920]  All right, thank you, Ms. Edmonds. I'm Ja'Kari Jackson and David Knight filling in for Alex
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.640]  while he's on the road. We'll have you back just in one second on the next side. But first,
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:23.480]  David Knight, real quick, what do you have?
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.120]  Well, I really appreciate you filling this in, Cabel, because we were talking about some
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.440]  details at the beginning of this. And sometimes you look at the really close tiny details
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.880]  like colors of backpacks and the feasibility of the government story. And that when we
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.800]  do that, we kind of try to get people to look at this and examine the official story. But
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:46.480]  what you've done is you've given us a larger context. You know, we were looking at the
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:49.840]  official story, whether there's bombing drills, that sort of thing. You bring it out to the
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.840]  larger picture.
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:05:20.520]  OK, we'll be right back after this break. Stay with us.

[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:21.240]  Network. Alright and welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Jakari Jackson and David Knight
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:26.280]  filling in for Alex. I said Alex have a good vacation. Alex Jones doesn't take vacations,
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:31.440]  he just has days when he's not in the office. Our guest is Cebel Edmonds. And Ms. Edmonds,
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:35.280]  we definitely want you to get to your other points. But first, can you clarify some of
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:39.360]  your statements earlier? You know, not everybody carries this third segment. So if you had
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.000]  four minutes, just give us your quick rundown and then we can get to the other points that
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.480]  you have on this topic. Well, again, I don't want to undermine the work, the great work
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:55.720]  you have done and other people have done in terms of pointing out to all the inconsistencies
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.880]  as they relate to the incident itself. You know, how there was a suspect carrying gun,
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:07.640]  was he armed, the backpack, as you pointed out, extremely important. It's just all of
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:13.720]  us together taking those inconsistencies, okay, putting together with the bigger picture
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:20.580]  and then following the events as they unfold after the incident. Very, very, very similar
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:30.360]  to 9-11 and to do that with a logical, cool headed way. And of course, as with all terror
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:37.200]  events you have for the government, for the powers, really positive externalities and
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:42.200]  what have been, you know, have been the positive externalities here with the incident. And
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:49.800]  number one, the government and the powers successfully had a test run, a test run for
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:58.160]  their martial law climate and they took Boston and they implemented it in a pretty large
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:04.920]  scale, I would say, considering we were talking about just one teenager, 19 year old on the
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:10.280]  run. He has never had paramilitary or military training and now we are hearing that he was
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:16.760]  not really armed and we stormed houses, we shut down stores. So unfortunately this was
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:23.000]  a very successful drill. This was the real drill for the government and for the powers,
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:29.480]  for the police, the state and very unfortunate because of the reaction we saw not only during
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:36.640]  the event but also afterwards from people in Boston.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:43.720]  I am really troubled by the fact that the test result shows that our nation is ready
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:49.280]  to be graduated in the graduation level of police state. I don't think you can get really
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:51.080]  any further than that.
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:57.160]  Absolutely. You know, I think, this is David Knight, how you doing, Cabel? I think it's
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.640]  real important to look at, like you said, the details to see if this is a contrived
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:06.080]  narrative. But as you just pointed out, they have a domestic agenda that they're after
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:11.760]  that is a military martial law type of police state. We saw that very clearly and we call
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.880]  that from the very beginning. You're bringing in a larger international agenda, which we
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.660]  see also with the war in Syria, that sort of thing. And you provided us information
[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:26.400]  about what you think might be possible motivations. We had a lot of information leaked by the
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:32.560]  Russian government that the FBI and the CIA were not giving us. And so you talked about
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.520]  that motivation. A lot of people didn't catch, a lot of stations don't cover the earlier
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.640]  wars. So could you recap that very briefly and just give us a quick recap of what you
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:48.840]  see is Russia's motivation in this, in the broader context of the Syrian war coming up?
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:56.200]  Because the three main objectives here have been, number one, Russia has been consistently
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:02.920]  for the past over a year, the biggest obstacle for our invasion of Syria. Okay. And to remove
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:08.360]  that obstacle, and that is Russia. And you're going to see this, especially with this Syria
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:16.720]  WMD al Iraq, Russia is going to step aside, kind of give us the green light saying, fine,
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.920]  I'm not going to be an obstacle. Go ahead, invade Syria. For Russia, Russia has been
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:27.720]  determined to go, I mean, drastically crack down on the factions. And these are our people.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:33.800]  These are United States governments. This is the CIA and NATO as part of Operation Gladio
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:39.720]  that started after the fall of the Soviet Union. That's why we call it the Operation
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:46.880]  Gladio Plan B in Central Asia and caucuses, taking various factions, radicalize them,
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:52.120]  train them, arm them, direct them, and use them as terrorists against Russia. We are
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:58.200]  doing it to a certain degree in Chinese border of Xinjiang. Some people know this area as
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:04.000]  Uyghuristan or Turkestan. If you look at the uprisings there, the radical Islamic terror
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.200]  cells, again, right now we are not talking about it. Right now they are freedom fighters.
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:14.240]  Right now they are the minorities that China is repressing. But one day, maybe based on
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:19.460]  a deal with China, we will have them, put them on the map as terrorists. But currently
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:24.800]  they are our guys there. And so for Russia, it's going to be applauded. This news just
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:31.680]  broke with Russia arresting over 140 radical Islamic terrorists from the region. These
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.240]  are the Dagestan Chechnya related factions within Russia. And we're gonna hear more.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.880]  We're gonna hear US Congress applauding it, US intelligence agencies, US media is going
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:45.840]  to applaud. And of course, the majority of the Americans who are only exposed to the
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:52.280]  mainstream media and they are only getting one sided flat made up narrative from the
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:53.280]  mainstream media.
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:54.280]  Absolutely.
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:58.840]  They are going to applaud it as well. Again, another unfortunate reality on the ground.
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:04.160]  When you're talking about that, how in one area now the Islamic terrorists, future Islamic
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:08.320]  terrorists are now called freedom fighters, just as we've seen before. And there's a famous
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:14.240]  quote from Henry Kissinger. He said, we have no permanent allies, only permanent interests.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:20.120]  And right now what they're interested in is going to war with Syria. We saw that talked
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:24.080]  about several years ago. And so we need to put that in the broader context. We need to
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:29.380]  see how they're using these Islamic groups as cutouts, as motivation and justification
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.880]  for their permanent interests.
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.440]  At one point, there are allies and then there are sworn enemies. And we see this happening
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:40.800]  over and over again. And then domestically, we also need to turn back to Henry Kissinger
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:47.280]  when it was just leaked with WikiLeaks. His comments said that the illegal we do immediately,
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:51.800]  the unconstitutional is more difficult, takes a little bit longer. That's what we see happening
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:52.800]  domestically.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:57.600]  So we need to look at Henry Kissinger for really kind of the backstory of what's going
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.440]  on domestically and internationally.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:04.280]  You are referring to the great game. And I think this is a good point to emphasize one
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:10.720]  fallacy out there that is being emphasized by people like, sure, the ex-C.I.A.s, the
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:18.480]  real CIA guy and a lot of quasi alternatives that pose as alternatives, real alternatives.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.200]  And that is this whole notion of blowback. I really caution people against thinking that
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.200]  way.
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.480]  Let's say even if 9-11 was a blowback, which it was not, OK, I'm a big believer of that
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:36.280]  based on all the facts that we have. You would think, OK, you know, fool the government once,
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:41.160]  U.S. government, shame on them and fool them twice. Shame on the government. You would
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:47.680]  think that would stop this terror creation through using radical Islam in Central Asia,
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:53.800]  Caucasus, Xinjiang area of China. We have been continuing this after 9-11.
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:58.300]  So this whole notion of blowback, I mean, you either have to say all these guys, including
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:04.480]  Kissinger and Brzezinski and all these neocons and CIA, they are so dumb and so naive that
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:08.920]  they keep doing the same thing. And lo and behold, it blows back right in our face and
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:14.120]  we get terror events. Or you have to change this notion of blowback.
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:19.000]  And I urge people to look at the context, to look at the history, to look at the last
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.600]  35 years, look at this recent event and the analysis we have been putting and then ask
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:30.040]  yourself, does it really look like blowback? Because this is like the second tier justification,
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:34.640]  the first year. OK, you know, the people are saying this was a genuine event. These guys
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:41.880]  were radical guys who caused the Boston terror. Then you have the second tier imposters, imposters
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:46.080]  who are coming and they are talking about, well, it's blowback and they're coming out
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:52.720]  already saying, you see, this is what happens when you say, you know, have some joint partnership
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:58.320]  for a while with some groups and whether it's Chechnya, it comes back and it haunts us.
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:04.480]  Well, that is as false as the scenario one, the official narrative. It is just the support
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:10.880]  that again is distraction. So I urge people to remove themselves, again, step back, look
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:14.960]  at it and you see that, come on, you know, how many blowbacks are we going to have? I
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:19.420]  mean, nobody is learning here. This is not a blowback as 9-11 was not a blowback.
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:24.000]  You have to at some point say, are the people who want to protect us, are they Keystone
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:33.600]  cops or are they kind of sly like a fox? I mean, you know, if they're so incredibly incompetent,
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:38.340]  that's one argument. But then the other thing is, as you're pointing out, and let's recap
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:43.720]  for people who are just tuning in to this hour. You're saying this because you worked
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:48.480]  at the FBI and as you told Alex, there'd be many times when you would be following somebody
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:53.040]  and the CIA would come in and basically take you off the case, take people at the FBI off
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:55.000]  the case, is that correct?
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.360]  Absolutely. I mean, not once, not twice, not three times. We had valuable suspects right
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:07.640]  after 9-11 and with the State Department, you know, it's like CIA, AKA State Department
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:13.680]  stepping in and saying, no, we want to deport these guys, send them back. We don't want
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:20.360]  them to be interrogated. Certain active investigations by the FBI, counterterrorism and counterintelligence
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:27.320]  operations investigations being shut down, completely being shut down, per pressure from
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:33.800]  State Department and the CIA. Now, officially, just for the people's benefit, they cite sensitive
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:38.440]  diplomatic relations and as they cited in my case, when they invoked the state secret
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:42.720]  privilege, they said, if this woman gets to talk, if her case goes through Congress with
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.640]  a hearing or goes through court, it will be detrimental for certain sensitive diplomatic
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:53.160]  relations United States has. Of course, people right away jump the gun and they're just talking
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:58.760]  about Saudi Arabia or Turkey. And all along, I've been talking about, it's not that, it
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:05.120]  is that a certain FBI investigations, counterintelligence, not counterterrorism investigation that covered
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:14.920]  the period 1996 till 2002 dealt with NATO-CIA operations in Russia's caucuses and Central
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:21.360]  Asia. Recruiting, training, radicalizing, arming, making them, turning them into terrorists,
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.360]  okay?
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:23.360]  To use them against Russia-
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.560]  Okay, Ms. Edmonds, Ms. Edmonds, we have to go to break. Are you available for just a

[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:11.320]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show,
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:15.360]  Jakari Jackson, David Knight filling in. Alex is on, well not vacation, he's just out of
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:19.640]  the studio for a few days. Our guest is Cebel Edmonds. Now, Ms. Edmonds, I have a question
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:20.640]  for you.
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:24.800]  Earlier when you were talking to Alex, you mentioned that the CIA was very interested
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:30.520]  in the older brother, of course referring to the Boston bombing suspects. Why was he
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:35.520]  so ideal and what does the CIA look for when they're recruiting?
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:41.120]  Let me give a personal example of how they recruit. And a lot of times, CIA recruits
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:48.280]  under the label State Department. In 1997, while I was pursuing my degree in George Washington
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:55.320]  University, one of my professors, okay, after class asked me to stay behind and said, look,
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:02.440]  you know, with your languages, Turkish, Farsi, other Turkic languages such as Azerbaijani
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:08.560]  and having multiple passports, et cetera, you would be an ideal candidate for the State
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:14.480]  Department. And I know they are very interested in having you work for them. Okay. And what
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:19.800]  it was that I found out, basically it was through State Department, it was the CIA.
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:26.920]  Because look, when you have the linguistic abilities, okay, you know the religion, the
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:35.680]  target religion, which is Islam, you look the part. Well, that is the perfect CIA operatives
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.920]  for that part of the world, whether it's the Middle East or Central Asian caucuses. I mean,
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:48.600]  you get a John Doe with blue eyes and blonde and a thick American accent and no language.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:54.080]  Come on. And you know, these people can be easily identifiable. And people around the
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:00.280]  world, they have, they know by now that, okay, through our embassies, we spy through our
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:06.600]  NGOs, which is for Central Asian caucuses for Russia. This is why Russia shut down all
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:13.120]  these U.S. NGOs. That's the number one CIA grounds for operations. And that is both the
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:19.160]  terror operations with other operations as well in this region, Russia and Central Asia
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:24.040]  through NGOs. So Russia was very smart with shutting down these NGOs because these NGOs
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:30.440]  are all our CIA. So again, people there, they know that that's the fact, so they watch out.
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:37.560]  So what is the best way for the CIA to have people on the ground to do the work, to take
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:44.720]  care of some of the operations, yet blend in, you know, yet not raise that much suspicions.
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:50.440]  And you have to also look at the nationalistic aspects of people within the region, too.
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:55.240]  No matter what, even if, let's say, they hate Russia, they are wary of the United States.
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:00.380]  They know that, okay, United States supporting them or asking them or training them or carrying
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:05.920]  out operations with them, it's not for the best benefit of those factions, those minority
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.680]  groups, those Islamic cells within the region. It is for the United States benefits. So they
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:17.240]  tend to trust people who look like themselves. You know, they have, they share their religion
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:22.600]  with, they share their language with. Therefore, they are very active. This is the CIA within
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:27.940]  the university campuses, and I believe that's where they recruited the older brother. That's
[02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:33.480]  the likely place. I'm not putting it as bad as I'm putting it as a highly likely possibility,
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:40.160]  as it occurred in my case. And he would be the ideal CIA operative candidates there,
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:46.080]  a conduit to further certain things that will be much easier to do with your average John
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.800]  Doe Americans. And same thing is true with Afghanistan, with all over Middle East. We
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:55.720]  do that a lot. And number one recruiting places are the universities, the college campuses
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:59.660]  here in the United States. Absolutely. He fits more the profile of that type of person
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:04.840]  than he does a terrorist because of his family relationships. And like you said, the multiple
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.960]  languages, that sort of thing, and even the lifestyle that he's living. I mean, no, it's
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:15.040]  as Alex had talked about it, very secular lifestyle. Now, you know, that's extremely
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:21.320]  important. Carrying Russian passport is very, very, very important. Yes, absolutely. Yeah,
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:27.640]  I'm looking at the bio for your book here, A Classified Woman, the Seabelle Edmonds story.
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:33.040]  And one thing really stuck out at me here, it says, having lived under Middle East dictatorships,
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.640]  Edmonds knows firsthand what can happen when government is allowed to operate in secret.
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:42.720]  I think, you know, so many times we've talked to people who've lived under foreign dictatorships,
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:48.280]  whether they're coming from Eastern Europe or some other place. And those are the people
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:52.880]  who see the hallmarks of what's happening here. And I think that's basically what gives
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:58.220]  you the guts to speak out on this, that maybe an American would look at the same situation
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:03.560]  that you saw and the American would say, this could never happen in America. This is America.
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:07.340]  This can't happen here. You've lived under it. We've seen other people who've come here
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:12.040]  from Poland, from Germany, from other places, and they say, we've lived under it too. And
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:18.400]  we see it happening and being repeated here. Absolutely. I mean, you aced it there because
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.120]  the reason that this is the reality for the Americans, number one, of course, is the mainstream
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:28.600]  media. When you look at Hollywood, even when you look at the textbooks, the history books
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:35.120]  in the United States, universities, high schools, it all has this illusion of, you know, like
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:39.720]  during the World War II with Hollywood. When American soldiers come, they hand out Hershey
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:44.560]  bars, you know, and then people are throwing flowers. You're liberating us, liberating
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:49.080]  us. We're the good guys. We can do no wrong. That's right. Thank you. We're going to continue
[02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:54.160]  this discussion on Monday. We're on the watch the empires on the run. Is he still there?
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:30:04.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:08.880]  But if you don't have a home security system and you're missing a critical weapon in your

[02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:07.400]  alone, the U. S. Has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011 storms and floods raged
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:12.360]  across the U. S. Costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:16.940]  drought in the country. In more than 50 years, you may think out of sight out of mind and
[02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:21.880]  so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages

[02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:14.400]  For Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand? Americans love television. They weaned their
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:21.840]  kids on it. Listen, they love game shows. They love wrestling. They love sports, violence.
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:30.560]  So what do we do? We give them what they want. We're number one, Ben. That's all that counts.
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:35.320]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years. Well, I haven't been in show business as long
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:41.520]  as you have, Killian, but I'm a quick learner. So I'm going to give the audience what I think
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:48.680]  they want. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the

[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:06.820]  his latest blockbuster where he shoots somebody's head off and that's perfectly fine. Anyway,
[02:34:06.820 --> 02:34:13.040]  if you're looking on prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com forward slash listen, you can see the FBI
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:17.040]  special agents page and this was something we were alluding to in the first hour.
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:22.020]  And I just want to show people, you can see right there, FBI.gov and we'll scroll down
[02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:27.400]  here to number 17. And this is just a point I was trying to prove earlier. I want to be
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:34.360]  an FBI profiler. First, you need to realize the FBI does not have a job called profiler.
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:40.160]  So the next time you see that on your big box network, just keep that in mind. There
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:44.360]  is no such position. And also real quick, guys, if you can stay right there.
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:46.880]  Or the next time CNN rolls it out as their expert.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:51.500]  Yeah, this is your expert FBI profiler. And this is something that Alex was alluding to
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:57.560]  as well. Obama promises abortion not going anywhere. That's article on infowars.com so
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:00.880]  you can go there and see it for yourself. Now, David, you have some comments about the
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:01.880]  Ron Paul interview?
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:02.880]  Yeah.
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:05.120]  And also we have Syrian girl in just a few minutes. Go ahead, David.
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:09.080]  That's right. One of the things I appreciate about Ron Paul is he always focuses on the
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:14.840]  bedrock issues. He focused on the Fed because it's such a central issue, our money and the
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:19.900]  soundness of our currency. And it has tentacles into so many other things. Education is that
[02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:20.900]  way as well.
[02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:26.480]  Education is a bedrock issue. Education is the future of our children. If you can grab
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:29.640]  them and every tyrant has said this going all the way back to Plato. If you can get
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:34.880]  the kids at an early age, they own them for life. Don't let them have your kids. Don't
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:39.640]  let the government schools take your kids. Take them back from people. Why is education
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:41.040]  a bedrock issue?
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.280]  Just look at this lockdown in Boston and the reaction of a lot of people to that. Children
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:49.640]  are being conditioned in schools for lockdowns. It didn't happen when I was in school.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:54.860]  It happened when I went to school. Our lockdown protocol was we're gonna line up against the
[02:35:54.860 --> 02:35:59.760]  wall right where the killer would walk by and just spray the wall and he's gonna shoot
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:00.760]  all of us.
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:03.840]  That's right. But if you go back and you look at the writings of the people who set up our
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:08.400]  government educational system, people like Mann and Dewey, they were very clear about
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:11.600]  what their purpose was. They were very clear about the schools. And just as we look at
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:14.520]  some of these things and say, wow, look at this, Homeland Security is not working and
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:18.500]  the FBI is not working and they got all these people at the finish line, but this still
[02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:19.500]  happened anyway.
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:22.840]  Wow, these guys are incompetent. We need to give them more power. We need to lose more
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:26.920]  freedoms. And then you look at it and you say, maybe that wasn't the design at all.
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:31.080]  Maybe they weren't really trying to stop this. And you gotta look at the same thing in schools.
[02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:35.320]  People say, Johnny can't read. What's the problem with this? Well, this government schools,
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:38.840]  that was never their first priority. That was the way they were sold to the parents.
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.760]  The parents wanted that, but that is not their priority. Their priority is to make the citizens
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:44.760]  passive.
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.040]  It is to make them dependent on the government. It is to make them see the government as God.
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:54.180]  And my wife has a master's degree in education. I took care of the religion and the politics
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:59.400]  stuff for my sons cuz I didn't wanna be a slave of sin or slave of government. And that's
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:01.000]  what we're looking at here.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:07.020]  The difference is the government looks at education as a way of filling a bucket. You
[02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:12.640]  are a passive bucket and they're going to stick information in you. We look at education
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:19.000]  as lighting a fire. We're trying to give our sons, our daughters the tools to educate themselves,
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.680]  the interest to pursue something and the freedom to pursue it, which you don't have in school.
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:28.760]  So if you've got kids in school, even if you can't work out how to get, if you're a single
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:32.320]  parent or something, you're having a difficult time working out how you're gonna do homeschooling
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:35.720]  because it is very difficult even with a two-parent home.
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:39.720]  Still, look at this curriculum because this is something that you can put in-
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:40.720]  The Ron Paul curriculum.
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:43.600]  The Ron Paul curriculum is gonna be coming out in September. This is something where
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:47.240]  you can fight back against the indoctrination that they're getting in school.
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:51.680]  And it's a lot of indoctrination, just like Alex talks about often, your kids go off to
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:56.200]  school. And how many guns do your parents own? Are they on any type of medication? I
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:01.820]  mean, how often do you go on vacation and all these other little things? Just be a snitch,
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:03.000]  do what the state tells you.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.880]  Like you said, the state is God.
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:05.880]  See something, say something.
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:11.040]  Yeah, I mean, they haven't come out and made the kids believe that, yes, yet, we are God.
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:15.320]  I wouldn't be surprised if they do that sometime soon, though. But anyway, guys, let me know
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:17.280]  if you have Syrian girl up and we'll go to her.
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.520]  Okay, so we have right now Syrian girl, popular YouTube channel. I believe it's the Syrian
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:26.280]  girl partisan channel. She joins us now to talk about all things Syria. Can you hear
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:27.280]  me?
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.680]  Yes, I can hear you. Thank you for having me.
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:33.540]  Thank you for being on. Okay, now I wanna start with this article right here. And once
[02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:37.360]  again, Jakari Jackson, David Knight filling in for Alex Jones while he is on the road.
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.880]  US intelligence points to small scale use of sarin and syrian. I wanna get your comment
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:47.460]  on this Syrian girl. Numerous questions remain about the origins of the chemical and what
[02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:54.100]  effect its apparent use could have on the ongoing Syria civil war.
[02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:58.460]  When asked whether the intelligence community's conclusion pushed the situation across Barack
[02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:04.240]  Obama's red line that could trigger more US involvement in the war. Hagel, that is Defense
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:08.440]  Secretary Chuck Hagel, said it was too soon to tell. But then we have this other article
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:15.160]  from Politico. Some lawmakers told last week about Syria and sarin, and it has John McCain,
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:20.120]  everybody's favorite John McCain, saying that we need to have intervention in Syria and
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:22.280]  also need to arm the rebels.
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:24.320]  So what are your thoughts about that?
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:33.160]  Well, this banter about chemical weapons has been going on for over a year now. The US
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:40.000]  saying it's got a red line on their use and accusations flying about their use. A high
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:46.120]  level source actually within the opposition told me that he was approached by the US State
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:53.880]  Department with a cash offer in exchange for claiming a hoax chemical weapons story. This
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:40:00.560]  was months and months ago. And he added that recently he saw the victims of bodies of supposed
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:06.080]  chemical weapons attacks in Syria and that he believed that those fighters died due to
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:11.680]  accidental discharge of makeshift chemical weapons that the FSA have themselves created.
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:19.280]  And, you know, there's been actually examples of the FSA, which is the rebels or insurgents,
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:27.440]  which is a more accurate term for them, have been using makeshift chemical weapons in Aleppo.
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:32.400]  And Channel 4, Alex Thompson covered this and many people, many civilians were hospitalized
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:38.440]  as a result. But it wasn't sarin because the symptoms didn't have the telltale signs of
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:43.240]  that. There was also videos that came out and I think in force covered this as well
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:53.840]  of the rabbits being killed by the FSA who were mixing chemical weapons. So there's some
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:41:01.200]  evidence that the FSA themselves are manufacturing their own chemical weapons and using them.
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:08.860]  The reason that this guy in the opposition didn't go along with this US State Department
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:14.360]  request is he wasn't convinced of their intentions to really intervene in Syria because they
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:21.680]  have never said that what they would do if their red lines crossed. And so this is still
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:29.240]  the case. So I would urge this person to come forward himself. But I think that the US agenda,
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:34.840]  potentially they have plans to intervene, but perhaps they just want to set a precedent
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:43.200]  for real chemical weapon use and the end agenda being to just further create more destruction.
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:49.560]  Because if you let the rabbit out of the hat, then that's it. Then, you know, it increases
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:55.360]  the likelihood of chemical weapons really being used.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:00.540]  Were you able to hear, I think we got an echo going back on the line there, but were you
[02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:04.440]  able to hear the interview that we had with Sebelle Edmonds earlier?
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:08.840]  No, unfortunately I wasn't able to.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:13.740]  We spoke to her and she had a very interesting take on both the Boston bombing and what's
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:19.480]  going on in Syria, kind of tying them together. And in her opinion, she said that she thought
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:24.000]  that this information that's coming out of Russian intelligence services linking these
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.880]  suspects in the bombing to foreign CIA involvement and that sort of thing.
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:35.800]  She believes that Russia has been the main obstacle to our involvement there in terms
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:40.280]  of nations. She believes that kind of a backdoor deal has been struck between American intelligence
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:45.680]  services and Russian intelligence services to essentially demonize Chechnya and give
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:52.480]  Russia a free hand to work there while giving us a chance to move into Syria because Russia
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:56.080]  is no longer opposing us. What do you think about that?
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:04.360]  I don't think that Russia is going to make a deal that sells Syria out, not at this point.
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:12.560]  I think that there's definitely something going on with Chechnya being labeled as the
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:18.800]  culprit behind the Boston bombings. The reason that Russia is supporting Syria at the moment
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:24.160]  is because there's some very radical Chechens coming across the border into Syria and they
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:32.840]  just started their own platoon. So to radicalize the caucus in the Middle East threatens Russian
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:40.120]  sovereignty and when I say radicalize, I mean create like an Islamic extremist ideology
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:46.400]  in its postulate like they did with Al-Qaeda. This is a threat to Russia and this is what's
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:51.480]  happening in Syria. So of course Russia is going to oppose, that's one of the reasons
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:44:00.920]  Russia is opposing US presidents in Syria. Now as for the backward deal, it's possible.
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:05.760]  The reason she said that was because, now what you're saying is that Russia is concerned
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:10.240]  about Chechen influence in Syria is one of the reasons that they're standing against
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:13.840]  involvement there. What she was saying and she had predicted this a week ago was that
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:19.880]  Russia would make a major move that they were being held back because of public opinion
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:22.780]  against them coming down too hard on Chechen rebels.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:27.820]  And here we are in the intervening week as more and more details have come out and as
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:35.080]  we've heard this constant drone in the news media about Chechen Islamicists that now Russia
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:41.840]  has been emboldened as Seville had predicted. And just in the last day or so has arrested
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:50.480]  140 people associated with Chechnya in Moscow. So that was kind of tied into what she was
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:56.680]  saying. Explain the reasons why the Russians would be releasing all this information about
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:03.720]  CIA involvement with the brothers and them being used as Chechen rebels.
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:12.520]  I think with the Boston bombing with the brothers, from the evidence I've seen, I have doubts
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:19.440]  that these guys were Islamic extremists at all, just by the way that they dress or the
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:25.080]  way that their Twitter feed was. It's really doubtful.
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:29.840]  And that's very important. Can you elaborate on that? Why do you have doubts?
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:41.520]  Well, if you look at the dress of the Al Qaeda style of terrorism, this might be superficial,
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:47.080]  but they usually have a beard and no mustache. And that's because they follow a very specific
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:53.800]  sect of Islam called Salafism or Wahhabism. And this is the case, you know, if it's not
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:58.680]  just a beard and no mustache, then at least the beard and neither of the two brothers
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:07.160]  had that. And it just seems bizarre because it doesn't fit the bill of what, you know.
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:13.400]  Exactly. Alex has pointed out that they had a very Western appearance and Western attitudes,
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:17.640]  that sort of thing. But of course, here in America, it's very difficult for us to talk
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:20.920]  about those kinds of nuances and get the American public to understand it. They don't understand
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:28.600]  the difference between Sunni and Shiite, for example. So when you talk about Wahhabi Islam,
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:33.280]  they don't understand that distinction either. So for the official government narrative,
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:37.720]  it works very well for them to just point out these guys were Islamicists. You know,
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:43.560]  that's it, period. Just because of where they come from, I suppose.
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:51.040]  For Russia, making a backdoor deal with the US regarding Chechnya, I don't see Russia
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:58.200]  selling Syria out. Just the position that they've taken up to this point is very hard
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:07.720]  to back down from. If anything, if they sold, you know, anything out, it wouldn't be full
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:13.960]  blown intervention. I still have my doubts that it would come to that. So perhaps this
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:18.440]  is more to do with political pressure. You know, this claim is coming also at a time
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:25.680]  when the Syrian military has been making sweeping advances in both Damascus and Aleppo. And
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:30.440]  it could just be a sign of desperation. You know, and in the first place, the claims are
[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:35.840]  coming out of Israel. And that's not exactly a neutral party when it comes to Syria. Syria
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:42.240]  and Israel have been enemies for, since Israel's inception. So, and Israel starts to gain the
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:47.800]  most out of the rebel or insurgent victory in Syria, as it would drive a wedge between
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:54.600]  Syria and Iran. Netanyahu says so himself. So it's no surprise that Israel is the one
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:58.240]  trying to push for intervention by the US and Syria.
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:03.680]  Well, it certainly bears close inspection. And as we've seen before, we've pointed out,
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:09.240]  just as we see with what we believe are domestic false flag operations, you know, we see a
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:14.440]  drill going on at the same time, at the same place of a terrorist activity, with exactly
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:18.560]  the same MO and that sort of thing. We see the government doing certain things over and
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:23.880]  over again. And one of the things that we see them do when they want to have a war is
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:30.160]  to bring up kind of bogus charges of weapons of mass destruction. We've seen this done,
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.560]  you know, for Iraq. We've seen it done a year ago, as you mentioned, this is a narrative
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:40.320]  that is being hyped up yet again in the last day or so. And we've already kind of covered
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:44.880]  this ground quite a bit once before, even in Syria.
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:51.120]  Absolutely, you know, and the ironic thing is, after the United Nations went through
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:57.800]  and found no chemical weapon evidence in Iraq, the US attacked anyway, and then proceeded
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:05.120]  to use chemical weapons in white phosphorous over Fallujah in Iraq. So really, this whole
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:11.120]  thing is not about chemical weapons. It's not about humanitarianism. It's about finding
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:12.120]  a way in.
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:16.440]  Tell us a little bit about the charges last year and how that boiled down. Can you kind
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:18.920]  of recap that for our audience?
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:21.360]  The charges last year of chemical weapons use.
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:25.520]  Yes. Mm hmm. Yeah. The charges, the allegations of chemical weapons use last year.
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:33.480]  There has been so many allegations. At the beginning, there was just some threats issued
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:39.400]  by the US, you know, in case you use chemical weapons. And there was one, I'm not sure if
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:47.080]  it was last year, it was a few months ago, where there was a few hundred injured civilians
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:52.720]  in Aleppo that had inhaled some kind of gas. Some of them had suffocated to death. But
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:58.360]  the gas itself wasn't sarin, which is the most likely weapon that Syria would possess.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:11.480]  Sarin is a nerve agent, and it's a lot more potent. And even people working with the wounded
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:20.240]  would be overcome by its effects. And that's not the symptoms. So I suppose none of the
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:25.760]  accusations have been able to stick. And I think this is another one of those. I mean,
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:31.480]  what evidence do they have? Chuck Hagel said that, you know, at the beginning he was saying
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:32.480]  there isn't enough evidence.
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:36.160]  Okay, hold on to that thought, Sarin girl. We have to go out to break and we'll come
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:40.440]  right back with that thought on Chuck Hagel. I'm Ja'kari Jackson. Dave and I filling in
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:44.120]  for Alex Jones who's out on the road. So stay tuned. We'll be back with Sarin girl right
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:48.120]  after this.
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:51:05.640]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:11.240]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the correct
[02:51:11.240 --> 02:51:18.000]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:24.080]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this one
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:28.640]  critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that
[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:33.840]  you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside
[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:38.240]  your door. But I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:44.360]  for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:49.440]  valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that thousands
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:53.400]  of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go watch my video
[02:51:53.400 --> 02:52:01.440]  now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.

[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:28.520]  All right, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show, Ja'Kari Jackson and David Knight
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:36.700]  filling in. Now we have an article on Infowars.com, U.S. Unveils Iraq WMD Curveball Style Lies
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:42.120]  versus Syria. So we have Syrian girls still on the line. And also Syrian girl, I want
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:48.020]  to ask you, we saw an article a couple of weeks ago about a young child hearing an AK-47
[02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:49.020]  in Syria.
[02:54:49.020 --> 02:54:54.880]  You saw that video as well? The 10-year-old boy, eight years old. He was smoking a cigarette
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:55:02.340]  and carrying an AK. Actually, there's been so many examples of children being used as
[02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:09.100]  soldiers in this war. You'd think that the crew of invisible children who made Kony 2012,
[02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:13.320]  that propaganda to have some comments about it.
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.740]  But yeah, and then I was talking a lot about that a couple of weeks ago on the Infowars
[02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:21.880]  Nightly News. And I was like, where are all the Kony people who were so concerned about
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:26.160]  a guy who many of the people in Uganda say has been dead for six plus years, at least
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:32.520]  been missing. But we see this child playing with explosives and AK-47s and nobody cares
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:33.520]  about that.
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:43.920]  It's actually, I've seen examples in the mainstream media where they kind of made it heroic or
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:51.760]  understandable that the rebels were using child soldiers in Syria. It's repulsive. But
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:57.000]  I did want to make a few last points about the chemical weapons that we were speaking
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:04.680]  about before. One thing is, again, the claims are coming out of Israel in the first place,
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:09.320]  but Syria isn't signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. So the media, when it's
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:15.000]  claimed that Syria is breaking international law, it's completely false. And another country
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:19.920]  that isn't signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention is Israel. So it's ironic that
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:24.240]  this information comes out from them. But Chuck Hagel, you know, at first he was saying
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:31.440]  that he was in disbelief about it. But then he said, the direct quote was, the decision
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:39.000]  to reach this conclusion was made in the past 24 hours. So it's kind of like saying, he
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.880]  decided to make a conclusion.
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:47.600]  So the conclusion wasn't made based on evidence, but political expediency. So finally, I did
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.880]  want to say that if the Syrian military were to use chemical weapons, then why would they
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:57.920]  use it on a small scale as is claimed here? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of chemical
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:03.960]  weapons, which is to cause mass destruction? Wouldn't it be simpler just to shoot the insurgents
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:09.960]  rather than use these small-scale chemical weapons? So it's really a bizarre claim and
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:17.120]  there's no evidence yet whatsoever. And even if they're coming up with evidence, it could
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:22.800]  just as easily be the FSA who have been using it, for which we have evidence of. And, you
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:27.240]  know, again, this is more excuse to create war, just as it was in Europe.
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.800]  Exactly. When we see these kinds of claims come up, we all ought to be skeptical. We
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:36.080]  all ought to demand a burden of proof that is much higher than we've seen in the past.
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:40.080]  You always hear those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. That's usually said about
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:44.840]  a generational ignorance. That's about something that's happened a long time ago. This is something
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:48.440]  that we saw happen just 10 years ago. And in this article that Jaqari referenced, it's
[02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:52.760]  on Infowars.com, curveball, let me just fill this in for people who are listening on the
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:53.920]  radio.
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:58:00.100]  That's the alias of the Iraqi defector who basically fabricated claims about Iraq's weapons
[02:58:00.100 --> 02:58:05.300]  of mass destruction. And the British Independent has an article here says the man whose weapons
[02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:11.640]  of mass destruction lies led to 100,000 deaths confesses all. A defector is going to tell
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:17.560]  how US officials sexed up his fictions. We'll cover that in just one second. But real fast,
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:19.920]  Syrian girl, how can people get in touch with you?

[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:31.680]  Jackson, David Knight, and also Searing Girl sitting in for the next five minutes, five
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:35.200]  minutes of overdrive. And we just want to run through some news articles. And Searing
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:37.900]  Girl, you are welcome to give your take as well. But David Knight, go ahead and finish
[03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:39.560]  up what you have.
[03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:43.680]  Also in that article that we referenced on InfoWars.com, and just think about this,
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:48.580]  what just recently happened with Libya. As a report, about 3,300 bombshells that were
[03:00:48.580 --> 03:00:55.020]  designed to carry mustard and sarin gas chemicals were destroyed years ago by Muammar Gaddafi
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:01:00.280]  when he was trying to make peace with the West. But instead, we went in and we overthrew
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:07.360]  him, right? And what remains now, though, there are still 10 metric tons of mustard
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:15.120]  gas and sarin gas stockpiled in barrels located in the Libyan desert south of Tripoli.
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:19.320]  And they're worried now that those weapons are going to show up in the hands of Al-Qaeda.
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:24.040]  So here you have someone who destroyed weapons of mass destruction, but we overturned him
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:30.120]  anyway. And then, even though that's supposedly our greatest concern is weapons of mass destruction.
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:34.280]  And yet, somebody who was cooperating with us on it, we went to war against him. And
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:41.440]  then, we left those in place to be used by Al-Qaeda, who are our allies in overthrowing
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:45.920]  the guy who was destroying his weapons of mass destruction. This is the insanity of
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:51.960]  our foreign policy that's being run by corporations to profit from this, the military.
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:55.160]  I don't know why people can't understand that we're funding these people.
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:56.160]  Yeah.
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:57.160]  I don't know.
[03:01:57.160 --> 03:01:58.160]  Yeah.
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:01:59.160]  Siren girl, what are your thoughts?
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:06.440]  Yeah. I mean, they've been funding them since the 80s. Al-Qaeda is the biggest tool in the
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:12.200]  Middle East for the U.S. and it's become blatantly obvious. I did want to make a comment about
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:21.040]  the first article where the one Iraqi spy led to the 100,000 deaths. It's funny because
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.960]  there was a BBC article about that that said the Iraqi who fooled the world. But you know
[03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:33.160]  what? The world wasn't fooled. The U.S. government wasn't fooled. The UK government wasn't fooled.
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:36.440]  They knew very well there wasn't any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:37.440]  That's right.
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:38.440]  The UN told them so.
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:39.440]  Mm-hmm.
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:43.400]  So to put all the blame of the war on this one guy and his supposed false claims-
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:44.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:45.400]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:46.400]  Mm-hmm.
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:51.320]  I think, though, the point is that here is a guy who is a key source and he's coming
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:55.160]  out and saying that it was a lie, just as we've seen Colin Powell admit that it was
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:03:00.240]  a lie and people underneath him. Now, you say it is blatantly obvious, and it is to
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:06.720]  everybody, that al-Qaeda is being run by the American CIA, and yet we had Rachel Maddow
[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:13.760]  criticizing Alex Jones on her television show a couple of days ago. One straw man, absurd
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:20.280]  argument after the other, and one of them was, he thinks that Barack Obama is the global
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:22.600]  head of al-Qaeda.
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:29.420]  Isn't that what that movie, that Tom Hanks movie, Charlie Wilson's War, isn't that about
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:34.520]  how we made al-Qaeda and Tom Hanks is running around? What do you guys need to shoot down
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:35.520]  these helicopters?
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:41.400]  Exactly. He took over the position as global head of al-Qaeda from George Bush, his predecessor.
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:46.040]  But she is so buried in partisanship that she's not going to admit that. But of course,
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:51.780]  it's also an effort to ridicule and try to take down Alex Jones to put the straw man
[03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:56.240]  argument up that, yeah, he's running al-Qaeda. Yeah, it's blatantly obvious.
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:03:59.440]  Yeah, you bring up a good point. I want to close with Syringer. We have about a minute
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:04.280]  or so left. Now, Syringer, we get criticized a lot for the information that we provide.
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:09.400]  Are you criticized as well, or what type of opposition do you come up against?
[03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:16.440]  I'm called many things. I'm called the Russian agent. I'm called not really Syrian. I'm being
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:23.760]  paid by the Assad government. Lots of things to try to blacken my name and my message.
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:29.920]  If I did have a bit of air time left, I would just like to say, you know, the manufacturing
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:34.600]  of claims of chemical weapons is still going. And that source that gave me information from
[03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:39.880]  inside the opposition, they say that the U.S. State Department approached him with false
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:44.720]  information about chemical weapons to try to make him the one to come out with it. So
[03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:49.520]  it's still happening. It's like regurgitation of the old tricks.
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:54.240]  And you know, even in all the time we have, Syringer, sorry to cut you off, but you're
[03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:57.760]  definitely welcome back on anytime. Info Wars Nightly News tonight. I believe it's Darren
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:15.760]  McBreen. So stay tuned tonight.
