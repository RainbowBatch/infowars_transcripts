[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:29.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.720 --> 00:34.360]  We are locked and loaded today. We've got Bob Chapman joining us, hadn't been on with
[00:34.360 --> 00:38.800]  us in two weeks to break down all the huge economic and geopolitical developments. Always
[00:38.800 --> 00:45.360]  one of our favorite analysts. We've got Gerald Cilente joining us today as well. So we have
[00:45.360 --> 00:56.800]  a big transmission lined up for you on this Friday, the 13th, 2012 transmission.
[00:56.800 --> 01:03.080]  Up on the Drudge Report, you can see Brandon Tuberbill's excellent article from infowars.com.
[01:03.080 --> 01:09.360]  Cashless Society, and it implements first biometric ID program for all of its 1.2 billion
[01:09.360 --> 01:18.040]  residents. We're gonna be going over some of that today. We've got incredible US news,
[01:18.040 --> 01:20.480]  world news, financial news.
[01:20.480 --> 01:26.440]  But it is Friday, and I've pledged in the new year to get to more of your phone calls.
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.440]  And I tell you, I've been taking a lot more. We've been kind of actually getting towards
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.880]  our goal a little bit, which is hard for me to do. I tend to get kind of set in my ways.
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.320]  I listened to my show from like 14 years ago, and I pretty much just took calls, and pretty
[01:39.320 --> 01:43.740]  entertaining, pretty informative. I mean, our goal is not to be entertaining, but reality
[01:43.740 --> 01:47.120]  is entertaining, nothing like reality.
[01:47.120 --> 01:53.880]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231. We're gonna open the phones up right now,
[01:53.880 --> 02:02.080]  800-259-9231. And we've got a lot of key news here today. South Carolina, Ron Paul surges
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.600]  past Santorum into top tier.
[02:05.600 --> 02:11.500]  Neocon Choice, Mitt Romney by Kurt Nemo. I do think it's a conflict of interest that
[02:11.500 --> 02:15.560]  Bain Capital's the majority owner of Clear Channel. And I don't hear Limbaugh or others
[02:15.560 --> 02:21.040]  criticizing Mitt Romney when they normally would. I mean, he's for abortion, carbon taxes,
[02:21.040 --> 02:24.360]  open borders, wrote Obamacare.
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.400]  And people send me emails saying, well, he's against abortion now. Well, yet now he says
[02:29.400 --> 02:33.880]  he is, but when it comes to actually votes and support, he wasn't. And I hear, well,
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.600]  he's against open borders now. That's a ruse to get the conservative vote. He's just like
[02:39.600 --> 02:45.200]  all the other mainline rhinos. He's for open borders, just like Newt Gingrich.
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.680]  And now Rick Perry's being attacked by Sean Hannity, Limbaugh, and others. We have an
[02:49.680 --> 02:53.440]  article out about it today. I don't like Rick Perry, let's get that straight. He's a globalist
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.340]  too. Calling him, I think I have the clip up on Infowars, Limbaugh's calling Rick Perry
[03:01.340 --> 03:04.160]  like Fidel Castro.
[03:04.160 --> 03:09.640]  He's a commie now for criticizing Bain Capital. See, you can't ever criticize hedge funds
[03:09.640 --> 03:14.040]  and corrupt things they do, cuz that's free market. Or really getting big banker bailouts
[03:14.040 --> 03:20.160]  like Goldman Sachs and others did, that's capitalism. You never hear these neocon talk
[03:20.160 --> 03:26.600]  show host explain there's crony capitalism that is the antithesis of a true free market
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.600]  society.
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.040]  And it's that juncture of government with that that's causing the destruction of our
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.720]  society. And it's the mega banks that always launder and even administer the welfare systems
[03:35.720 --> 03:41.200]  and the phone banks and the rest of it to get the general welfare class on chicken feed
[03:41.200 --> 03:47.680]  to make them dependent. So they can always sick the giant massive 100 million or more
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.040]  welfare recipients on those of us that work.
[03:51.040 --> 03:56.840]  It's real simple, the ultra rich with a bunch of paid off just like the Romans did 2,000
[03:56.840 --> 04:04.940]  plus years ago. They had most of the city of Rome on the dole. A few little Roman silver
[04:04.940 --> 04:11.700]  pieces a month for every head of the household and as much bread as you can eat. And nobody's
[04:11.700 --> 04:16.000]  gonna rebel against the government and by the end of the Roman Empire, they would even
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.240]  first they made the poor people then the wealthy then the ultra rich.
[04:19.240 --> 04:26.760]  You had to make your wives and daughters be whores at temples so that they could pay more
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.860]  taxes. There was never enough taxes. By the way, I saw two articles. I saw one under Spiegel
[04:31.860 --> 04:36.720]  and Reuters last week. And I meant to cover this at the time I didn't guys type into the
[04:36.720 --> 04:37.880]  search engine.
[04:37.880 --> 04:47.080]  People won't believe that. Woman ordered to take job as prostitute or lose unemployment
[04:47.080 --> 04:54.000]  payments in Germany. So we're right back to Rome. All right, it's all coming up today.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  I mean, you get in that whorehouse and service 10 men a day or you're not gonna get paid
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.400]  your welfare check. Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.920]  record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors thankful for the unemployment
[05:09.920 --> 05:15.320]  checks and she were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of
[05:15.320 --> 05:18.240]  a Christmas gift along with thousands of other Americans.
[05:18.240 --> 05:23.960]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control? The fact is in all this
[05:23.960 --> 05:29.080]  craziness, there's only one thing you can control your greatest dependency, your food

[07:01.800 --> 07:06.080]  the global elite are now storing non hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[07:06.080 --> 07:10.420]  Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[07:10.420 --> 07:14.280]  than silver or gold? It's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in
[07:14.280 --> 07:18.600]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions
[07:18.600 --> 07:23.880]  from Science have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival
[07:23.880 --> 07:29.760]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[07:29.760 --> 07:34.000]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.580]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at
[07:38.580 --> 07:47.600]  survival seed bank.com. That's survival seed bank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[07:47.600 --> 07:56.600]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[07:56.600 --> 08:02.920]  This is Alex Jones for survival seed bank.com. Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly
[08:02.920 --> 08:14.960]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind. Welcome my friends
[08:14.960 --> 08:22.960]  to another worldwide transmission in an attempt to wake up humanity for the perils of tyranny.
[08:22.960 --> 08:29.000]  You're going to be here for the next three hours and I will be back live this Sunday
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.040]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. The websites are prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com and
[08:38.040 --> 08:45.260]  infowars.com. The one, the only, always informative Gerald Cilente will be joining us coming up
[08:45.260 --> 08:50.040]  in the second hour today and always our Friday guest, Bob Chapman, who wasn't with us last
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.640]  Friday, so he's got a lot to talk about. We've got world news. We've got the Middle East
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.040]  just ratcheting up towards World War Three, the hot war expanding.
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.440]  Now the corporate dinosaur press is now admitting what we already knew. The war is already going
[09:06.440 --> 09:15.400]  on inside Iran. We got big news on the economy and a lot more today. And I do want to take
[09:15.400 --> 09:24.840]  your phone calls as well. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231. On any issue,
[09:24.840 --> 09:30.280]  any news item, any question, any comment, disagree, agree.
[09:30.280 --> 09:34.080]  Love me, hate me. It doesn't matter. We don't screen your calls. We just ask where you're
[09:34.080 --> 09:37.360]  calling from and what your name is. And if you want to volunteer higher listening, that
[09:37.360 --> 09:45.080]  makes it interesting. Shortwave, XM, AM-FM, Internet, Roku, whatever the case is.
[09:45.080 --> 09:48.540]  And Robert, Chuck, Charles, Ezekiel, Pat and others, we're going to get to here in a moment
[09:48.540 --> 09:53.160]  because I want to kind of shake the show up a bit, kind of go to calls early and then
[09:53.160 --> 10:00.760]  burrow into news. First, the National Defense Authorization Act, now the Enemy Expatriation
[10:00.760 --> 10:04.840]  Act and we've been covering this for a few weeks, but I want to break down what the government's
[10:04.840 --> 10:05.840]  going to do.
[10:05.840 --> 10:09.840]  They're just going to say outside of a court, well, you're no longer a citizen, so we can
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.000]  disappear you into a black hole. But they've already got it on paper that they can kill
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.480]  citizens and disappear you into a spider hole, into a devil dungeon. So why are they doing
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.720]  this? Because they don't want to do that up front, even though they claim they have this
[10:24.720 --> 10:27.140]  illegal unconstitutional power.
[10:27.140 --> 10:38.720]  They want to finagle it and give it some cheap packaging and cover, some cheap camouflage
[10:38.720 --> 10:46.440]  that well, we waved a magical wand. And so you're no longer a citizen and can be renditioned
[10:46.440 --> 10:51.340]  off to some torture center. So we're gonna be breaking that down. Systematic silence
[10:51.340 --> 10:58.440]  about NDAA proves long plot to destroy America is real, vindicating conspiracy theorists.
[10:58.440 --> 11:05.240]  We're gonna be going over that report. Also, CNET News, a division of CBS Interactive,
[11:05.240 --> 11:14.580]  DHS X-ray scanners could cause cancer. But that's only for border crossers. You can't
[11:14.580 --> 11:17.760]  body scan them, but you will body scan the citizens.
[11:17.760 --> 11:24.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've had radiologists, we've had scientists on for the last decade
[11:24.200 --> 11:31.360]  or so, breaking down that they have people at the US border, at the north and the south,
[11:31.360 --> 11:39.280]  and now at domestic checkpoints inside the United States, who drive through these X-ray
[11:39.280 --> 11:45.520]  machines. Now, previous to this a decade or so ago, they had you get out.
[11:45.520 --> 11:53.680]  They had the border patrol people and technicians behind armored plate by armored lead that
[11:53.680 --> 11:59.520]  blocks out the X-rays. They had the people get behind it with them in a holding room
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.800]  or off to the side, and then they would roll the car up over the conveyor belt and X-ray
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.600]  it. Well, just like prior to 1990, the military was not allowed to use depleted uranium weapons
[12:11.600 --> 12:14.120]  because they knew since the 50s it was deadly.
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.460]  In the studies they'd done, they had the weapons in case nuclear war already broke out. Troops
[12:18.460 --> 12:24.840]  were fighting 10 to 1 superiority at the folder gap. If the Russians rolled across into Germany
[12:24.840 --> 12:32.320]  during the Cold War, it was an emergency weapon in emergency armories. 1990 came around, they
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.560]  said, go ahead and use it. Just don't have the troops get close to tanks they've shot
[12:37.560 --> 12:38.560]  up with it.
[12:38.560 --> 12:45.800]  Not telling you that when you fire it out of a Abrams gun or out of a Marine Corps warrior
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.800]  vehicle or out of a Bradley fighting vehicle, that it's igniting in the barrel and that
[12:51.800 --> 12:55.840]  you're getting a deadly dose as well. Sure, it'll kill you 20 years later on average,
[12:55.840 --> 12:59.520]  a horrible death, kidneys failing, tumors everywhere, lung cancer, but so what?
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.720]  It's a gift from the New World Order. And it's the same thing here. Up until about a
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.880]  decade ago, the Border Patrol and others always got behind the ray shielding, not now. In
[13:11.880 --> 13:16.080]  fact, guys, now that I thought about this, I'm gonna do an assignment on air part of
[13:16.080 --> 13:21.840]  our total transparency program, try to get me Watson, our star writer.
[13:21.840 --> 13:28.480]  A lot of Kurt's right there, Steve, Aaron, but Paul is the Grand Slam winner. I mean,
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.080]  he's the Triple Crown winner. Get me Watson online, please, just dial. It seems like the
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.320]  number you calls his home the way you want to answer. I call the cell, that's why I can
[13:38.320 --> 13:40.080]  always get him.
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.360]  If you want it, it's the first British number. Or you're just calling Skype, see if he answers
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.040]  that. Okay, I don't think that, if he's not at his computer, he won't see that, but okay.
[13:50.040 --> 13:58.560]  But the point is, if we need to get Watson to write an article on this, and get the Fox
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.560]  piece out of New York, and a CBS news piece we've got out of Florida, and past articles
[14:03.560 --> 14:12.880]  we did, where it shows the army, the army under TSA in all three newscast, with giant
[14:12.880 --> 14:16.520]  mobile x-rays having families drive under it.
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.080]  Not just people at the border, and the army soldiers under TSA control, one of these is
[14:22.080 --> 14:29.560]  like four years old, the first one I saw out of New York, Fox News, standing under the
[14:29.560 --> 14:41.400]  radiation machine. Standing under the radiation machine, and of course, it's bad for the family.
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.360]  This is shooting through steel, through aluminum, and you can see the newscast where it shows
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.600]  people hidden in trunks and things, or guns, as an example. You can see their bodies, it's
[14:50.600 --> 14:54.440]  shooting through, a lot more powerful than something that shoots through your chest.
[14:54.440 --> 15:02.200]  You know how bad a chest x-ray is, but the real people being barbecued, barbecued, are
[15:02.200 --> 15:08.720]  the border patrol, are the TSA, are the military people. But I'm in Vegas a few months ago,
[15:08.720 --> 15:13.840]  coming back from an interview with Jesse Ventura, and the guy goes, I know who you are, you're
[15:13.840 --> 15:16.660]  opting out, I'm gonna have to grope you, basically.
[15:16.660 --> 15:21.880]  And I get, and I say, that's deadly radiation. He says, no, it's not, Alex, they've given
[15:21.880 --> 15:26.080]  us the documents, it's one one-billionth of a cell phone call. And I said, really, what
[15:26.080 --> 15:29.600]  are those measured in? That's a different type of wavelength. He goes, whatever, you
[15:29.600 --> 15:31.520]  just believe what you want.
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.880]  He's like, John Hopkins says it's not bad. And I said, really, I saw that report a few
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.880]  months ago, earlier in the year. Did you know the head of John Hopkins Radiology came out
[15:40.880 --> 15:44.260]  and said that there never was a study done with Homeland Security? And that the study
[15:44.260 --> 15:46.560]  they did do said it does cause cancer?
[15:46.560 --> 15:55.860]  And he goes, whatever, whatever. The other TSA guys were looking at me like, kinda warily.
[15:55.860 --> 15:58.920]  So I give this big speech about how they're all being fried. And I told him, I'm gonna
[15:58.920 --> 16:04.000]  sue you if you touch, even through the pants, my genitals. And he didn't do it, he said
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.440]  this stupid pat down. And obviously, he knew who I was, syndicated radio host, no criminal
[16:08.440 --> 16:13.720]  record. He's telling me he knows who I am. He goes through this, it's about 8 AM, I've
[16:13.720 --> 16:17.680]  got about three hours sleep.
[16:17.680 --> 16:20.280]  And I'm wanting to get home to my family. And plus, I kinda wanted to go through the
[16:20.280 --> 16:24.560]  test. I was intending to sue them if they did. I intended to air the audio I was recording
[16:24.560 --> 16:31.200]  with the iPhone, but he didn't really, just did a light frisk. So I just said, okay, whatever.
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.560]  We all know this is going on. And of course, they're still doing it to children. But the
[16:34.560 --> 16:43.880]  point is, what happened 22 years ago or so, where they said, do you use okay for the troops?
[16:43.880 --> 16:50.200]  What happened in the last decade where they just said, have the border patrol, have them
[16:50.200 --> 16:54.680]  all just stand there. I mean, before they drove the cars or 18 wheelers into a whole
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.600]  building, and they still have some of those.
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.560]  But they've now proliferated other checkpoints and units, where it is a radiation spraying,
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.720]  super high powered x-ray machine. And by the way, I've seen the newscasts and videos and
[17:07.720 --> 17:13.080]  photos of this. The border patrol aren't even wearing radiation badges, violates federal
[17:13.080 --> 17:25.640]  law. They're just all standing around with systems that shoot through a vehicle.
[17:25.640 --> 17:31.040]  Let me guess, he didn't answer on any numbers. Yeah, I'll do it right now. Watch this, cuz
[17:31.040 --> 17:36.720]  I've been like, it's no big deal. He has like three numbers. And I have the one that works.
[17:36.720 --> 17:42.520]  And I'm ready to give this to you. Because it's like Groundhog Day, but I know everything's
[17:42.520 --> 17:43.520]  changing up here.
[17:43.520 --> 17:47.760]  Everybody's doing a great job. And we'll see, he answers about 98% of the time, okay? I
[17:47.760 --> 17:53.840]  just don't wanna have a one way conversation with him here. Point is, I get these hot ideas.
[17:53.840 --> 18:00.800]  Because now people, I'll be ready to listen to this. Hey, Paul, how you doing, bro? You're
[18:00.800 --> 18:03.840]  listening to the show, great. We're gonna try to call you. Can you get by your computer?
[18:03.840 --> 18:10.120]  Can I bring you up real quick on Skype after the break, real quick? Okay, fantastic, just
[18:10.120 --> 18:15.080]  be by your Skype. Thanks a million. All right, here we go. Well, he's already heard my idea
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.360]  show, he's already listening.
[18:16.360 --> 18:19.960]  Yeah, I don't think in that database you even have his right number. Cuz nobody can ever
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.960]  get him and he's moved, and I've got his number right here. Yeah, here, here, I'll just give
[18:24.960 --> 18:28.680]  it to you right now, here you go. No, no, I'm just gonna give you my phone right now.
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.000]  This is gonna be a day long remember right now, our databases is all scrambled. We're
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.520]  gonna get all the numbers in one spot. Thank you, great job. Okay, now, the point is we're
[18:38.520 --> 18:46.140]  talking about a life and death situation here. And so I wanna explain to people, it's not
[18:46.140 --> 18:52.360]  just the border crossers that they have drive under giant high powered x-ray machines.
[18:52.360 --> 18:58.640]  That are so powerful when they flip the switch, you can actually hear it power up and beam
[18:58.640 --> 19:06.000]  and fry you. That's horrible for the people going through it, especially those that have
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.720]  to deliver back and forth on the border. But I think about the day where I pull up at one
[19:11.720 --> 19:13.640]  of these checkpoints run by the army.
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.640]  It violates Posse Comitatus, it violates the 10th Amendment states rights. It violates
[19:17.640 --> 19:22.760]  the Fourth Amendment and they are gonna physically try to assault me. And I've driven through
[19:22.760 --> 19:28.360]  checkpoints 99 miles into the country. That's where they've got the one down in South Texas.
[19:28.360 --> 19:33.140]  And I've never left the US. They wanna search my vehicle, they got big x-ray machines there.
[19:33.140 --> 19:37.520]  And to stop them, to stop them from trying to barbecue me and my family, I've got to
[19:37.520 --> 19:40.600]  stand up to the pack of hyenas.
[19:40.600 --> 19:44.240]  And again, I'm not saying the Border Patrol are bad themselves, but in their role, they're
[19:44.240 --> 19:50.200]  hyenas. And I've got to stand up to them and preach at them and be laughed at by them.
[19:50.200 --> 19:56.600]  Let me tell you something, when you're diagnosed with cancer, I know you're gonna be pretty
[19:56.600 --> 20:00.760]  much dead. But at least you can go public to warn others.
[20:00.760 --> 20:05.680]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century? Record foreclosure

[24:26.760 --> 24:34.160]  You know, it upsets me. I mean, I get angry of thinking about the collective insanity
[24:34.160 --> 24:46.160]  of our society. That we let the crazy control freaks that run our government, let the troops
[24:46.160 --> 24:54.520]  use depleted uranium. It's a death sentence and that we have to pay for as they degenerate
[24:54.520 --> 24:59.000]  and die. That they're setting up x-ray systems, not just at airports, but all over the country.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.280]  And in fact, I've seen news articles out now admitting they have helicopters and aircraft
[25:04.280 --> 25:10.880]  beaming with ground-penetrating radar looking through our houses. They've got mobile police
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.880]  units looking through our walls. They've got police with backpack units that look through
[25:15.880 --> 25:21.200]  your walls, blasting high-powered waves.
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.840]  And because the defense companies wanna sell these products, they just have government
[25:25.840 --> 25:35.480]  wave a magic wand and say that it's okay. So what I want Paul Watson to do, cuz I know
[25:35.480 --> 25:44.600]  he's listening. What I want Paul Watson to do, we do now have up, is Paul, we need to
[25:44.600 --> 25:49.800]  explain and have some article that we're all being bathed and then speculate on why the
[25:49.800 --> 25:55.560]  system doesn't care. Cuz the military-natural complex makes money, whatever, with the DU.
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.240]  But they mainly tie it in though with finally CBS News reporting, hey, these border patrol
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.360]  x-ray machines could be giving people that are going under them cancer. No kidding, what
[26:05.360 --> 26:09.800]  about the border patrol and then that Fox News piece out of New York and other places
[26:09.800 --> 26:16.520]  where it shows the military out under TSA that we reported on like four years ago, showing
[26:16.520 --> 26:22.440]  the families drive under it? I mean, this is sheer madness, Paul.
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.440]  And I understand you're gonna say, Alex, we've reported on this probably 50 times. I know,
[26:26.440 --> 26:35.800]  but now, once the great lord CBS reports on it, now the sheeple, you can say as CBS is
[26:35.800 --> 26:40.040]  now telling you they've known about this for a long time, here's the full story.
[26:40.040 --> 26:45.480]  Because only after the reality controllers tell us something, is it actually real? And
[26:45.480 --> 26:51.900]  see now people will actually listen, now that they want the sheep to know this. Paul Watson,
[26:51.900 --> 26:55.100]  your take on this.
[26:55.100 --> 27:01.080]  It was reported in Forbes magazine nearly a year ago that Homeland Security as far back
[27:01.080 --> 27:09.400]  as 2006 had got plans to have these roving vans on which x-ray scanners were mounted,
[27:09.400 --> 27:16.040]  backscatter x-ray scanners that would just randomly scan crowds of people at sports events
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.000]  and basically just on the highway and street corners.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.720]  So the fact that they're using it at border checkpoints when they're already using it
[27:24.720 --> 27:30.200]  at truck stops on highways is par for the course because it's already been announced.
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.680]  And imagine you pull up, they've got idiots that work there who have got death sentences.
[27:35.680 --> 27:41.120]  Their gums are probably already bleeding from the radiation. Their fast growing cells are
[27:41.120 --> 27:44.520]  already probably, they're wondering why their teeth are falling out. And they're like, you
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.480]  gonna go in it with your family? No, I'm not. That's assault, you idiot. And just because
[27:49.480 --> 27:54.960]  you wanna kill yourself doesn't mean you're gonna kill my family, you moron scum.
[27:54.960 --> 27:57.940]  What do you say to them, Paul? Cuz they're setting the same stuff up in England right
[27:57.940 --> 27:58.940]  now.
[27:58.940 --> 28:08.320]  Well, it's only the next stage. I mean, they've already got planned mobile interrogation booths
[28:08.320 --> 28:14.160]  where if you want to go into an expo or a sports event or any kind of public event,
[28:14.160 --> 28:20.120]  first, not only do you have to submit to the body scan, you also have to submit to an interrogation
[28:20.120 --> 28:24.680]  from a Homeland Security official to make sure you're not a terrorist.
[28:24.680 --> 28:30.720]  So if people think that if I avoid flying, and then it becomes if I avoid getting a bus,
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.240]  if I avoid getting a train, if I avoid leaving my house, then maybe I can escape this. But
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.000]  you can't. It's taken over your whole life. And it needs to stop now. I mean, Europe's
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.840]  largely banned the certain type of X-ray body scanner. Because I mean, even if they wanted
[28:47.840 --> 28:55.080]  to do this, there are X-ray, there are body scanners, which use a certain type of transmission.
[28:55.080 --> 29:02.440]  Sony uses them in their, in their construction plants, which don't throw out harmful radiation.
[29:02.440 --> 29:08.400]  They're available and yet they choose to use the ones that John Hopkins and other scientists,
[29:08.400 --> 29:13.720]  there's one quoted in this CNET report, said will cause cancer.
[29:13.720 --> 29:19.320]  But what does the TSA do? When John Hopkins comes out and says it'll kill you, TSA takes
[29:19.320 --> 29:22.280]  their report and says it doesn't hurt you.
[29:22.280 --> 29:29.480]  Precisely. And then there was the leaked case out of one of the airports where they found
[29:29.480 --> 29:32.320]  a cluster of cancer cases from TSA screeners.
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.040]  Paul, I want to give you the floor for five minutes since I roused you out of writing
[29:36.040 --> 29:39.520]  to break down the spectrum of this. Then I'm going to phone calls and all the other news.
[29:39.520 --> 29:48.600]  But this type of issue illustrates the collective lunacy and insanity going on. The TSA agents
[29:48.600 --> 29:49.800]  are all killing themselves.
[29:49.800 --> 30:01.440]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.440 --> 30:05.720]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[30:05.720 --> 30:10.320]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[30:10.320 --> 30:14.160]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[30:14.160 --> 30:16.840]  anywhere in or on the body.
[30:16.840 --> 30:21.960]  My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator. Not only does
[30:21.960 --> 30:26.720]  the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes
[30:26.720 --> 30:31.960]  equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly
[30:31.960 --> 30:39.920]  to key target areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and
[30:39.920 --> 30:42.240]  orally for the digestive system.
[30:42.240 --> 30:49.480]  Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com

[33:08.800 --> 33:16.600]  state, silence isn't golden, it's yellow. You are listening to Alex Jones broadcasting
[33:16.600 --> 33:22.600]  live from the front lines. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:22.600 --> 33:36.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. I'm here to tell you my
[33:36.400 --> 33:45.480]  friends that you need to shake yourselves out of your trance. Why has Infowars been
[33:45.480 --> 33:50.880]  so effective? Why have we reached hundreds of millions of people and exponentially more
[33:50.880 --> 33:52.760]  every week?
[33:52.760 --> 34:00.040]  Because I'm a real person just like you, and I'm angry. And it freaks me out to watch criminals
[34:00.040 --> 34:05.440]  on national news, talk about how much they love the troops and how honorable they are.
[34:05.440 --> 34:14.160]  And then attach the heroic honor of the military because regardless they're facing danger.
[34:14.160 --> 34:18.240]  And many of them believe they're doing the right thing. Attach that mantle onto these
[34:18.240 --> 34:28.040]  criminal anti-American globalist politician pimps, mercenaries. And then to talk to the
[34:28.040 --> 34:35.920]  troops in person and to watch the C-SPAN hearings 15, 16, 17 years ago with tens of thousands
[34:35.920 --> 34:40.160]  dying from DU poisoning and the VA trying to block it.
[34:40.160 --> 34:43.680]  And then learning that the local veterans groups won't help troops when they come back
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.520]  and are sick, so they just commit suicide. And to know there's seven times the previous
[34:48.520 --> 34:53.160]  record of suicides. But no, no, no, no, if you're a patriot, you're supposed to just
[34:53.160 --> 35:00.600]  not talk about that. You're supposed to tell the troops go home and die.
[35:00.600 --> 35:07.280]  And now they're putting in body scanners everywhere and saying that mobile trucks on the streets.
[35:07.280 --> 35:13.000]  And I've got videos from around the country, it's not getting news, it's local news. Local
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.680]  news of families in the middle of states, 100 miles from the border or more, not even
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.240]  at border patrol checkpoints. National Guard under TSA with state police with submachine
[35:26.240 --> 35:28.200]  guns and you pull up.
[35:28.200 --> 35:33.280]  And the military standing there, five feet from the big scanner wand, sticking out from
[35:33.280 --> 35:40.720]  a truck with cars with families rolling under it. Listen, punk, you try to assault me and
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.300]  my family, I pull up to one of those checkpoints, I'm done. You're not gonna hurt my children
[35:45.300 --> 35:49.960]  just because you're a moron, just because you follow orders. If the government told
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.480]  you to stick your hand in a garbage disposal and flip the switch, would you do it?
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.360]  If the government told you to shoot yourself in the head, would you do it? If they told
[35:56.360 --> 36:02.520]  you to jump off a cliff, would you do it? I mean, I am sane, okay? Those of you that
[36:02.520 --> 36:09.400]  go along with this system are insane. And I understand in a world of insane people that
[36:09.400 --> 36:13.640]  have been incrementally taught to go along with anything, a sane person, an angry person
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.520]  sounds crazy. No, I'm as sane as the day is long.
[36:18.520 --> 36:30.760]  And I'm angry, and I don't like what's happening. I've had those discussions with my family.
[36:30.760 --> 36:39.560]  I've had those discussions with my family about whether do we leave the country or not?
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.160]  And I've said we're staying, we're not gonna give up the fight. And I'm watching V for
[36:45.160 --> 36:50.080]  Vendetta this morning. And it's got the scene where she's sitting there talking about, well,
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.360]  my mom wanted to leave the country but my dad didn't.
[36:52.360 --> 36:56.680]  He said we didn't wanna lose, they would win like it was a game, then it shows them bust
[36:56.680 --> 37:00.960]  the door down and grab people. Guys, I wanted to play a clip from that today during the
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.080]  third hour. I don't know if we'll have time now to get it off the DVD because I forgot
[37:05.080 --> 37:06.080]  coming in.
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.160]  Well, somebody run around and look on the tables out there or maybe in my car, wherever
[37:10.160 --> 37:18.720]  my keys are at for V for Vendetta. I want the scene in there where they meet with V
[37:18.720 --> 37:28.280]  and he's sitting there talking and no, thanks. And they don't know it's V in disguise and
[37:28.280 --> 37:33.980]  he's explaining to the police how the government released the bio weapon itself to create martial
[37:33.980 --> 37:38.660]  law and blame it on their enemies. And then also made profit from the drug that they'd
[37:38.660 --> 37:40.320]  already developed to treat it.
[37:40.320 --> 37:46.000]  That's what happened with the anthrax and the antibiotic they had, the Cipro that came
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.800]  right out that all the globalists made the money off of. It's just unbelievable how they
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.800]  operate. I mean, there's no end to these people. And we're going to face this as a society.
[37:56.800 --> 38:00.820]  And last night, I don't let my children watch mainline TV, but I let them watch stuff like
[38:00.820 --> 38:07.360]  Andy Griffin. And we were watching one called Andy Griffin discovers America.
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.320]  And it's this whole speech about 1776 and Liberty and the Second Amendment. We were
[38:12.320 --> 38:15.320]  letting the children watch this at about seven o'clock at night. My wife looked at me and
[38:15.320 --> 38:21.400]  she said, man, television's really changed. Yeah, they got a new TV show coming out on
[38:21.400 --> 38:27.320]  prime time where the toddler uses the F word, which is supposed to be shocking and funny.
[38:27.320 --> 38:32.940]  It's about getting rid of any morals. And it's about the fun of degradating things,
[38:32.940 --> 38:36.440]  not the fun of learning knowledge. Okay, I'm going to your calls. I want to go back to
[38:36.440 --> 38:41.520]  Watson. Watson, you've got the floor for five minutes to go over the history of these naked
[38:41.520 --> 38:43.360]  body scanners and the rest of it.
[38:43.360 --> 38:47.860]  Then I'm going to come back and go to calls. But break down the proliferation of this without
[38:47.860 --> 38:48.860]  me interrupting.
[38:48.860 --> 38:57.360]  Well, a recent article I wrote is the fact that the Viper teams, which is the TSA agents
[38:57.360 --> 39:03.860]  who will be conducting these border and highway scanning checkpoints, they've already got
[39:03.860 --> 39:12.380]  25 of them. They've had 9300 unannounced checkpoints over the course of 2011. The study that they
[39:12.380 --> 39:20.840]  did into them found that they thwarted no terrorist plots. They influenced no, you know,
[39:20.840 --> 39:27.520]  they had no influence on public safety, completely worthless. And yet Congress last month authorized
[39:27.520 --> 39:37.880]  another $24 million to create 12 new Viper checkpoint teams. So these 9300 checkpoints
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.120]  manning these x-ray scanners are only going to increase in 2012, which is why they've
[39:43.120 --> 39:49.500]  expanded them out from the airport to bus stations, ferry terminals, train stations.
[39:49.500 --> 39:56.400]  We even had TSA people at a prom night. Remember that story. And of course on the highway.
[39:56.400 --> 40:02.240]  So basically any public place whatsoever, even though the study has proven that, you
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.780]  know, they prevent, they don't even prevent a threat to public safety, nevermind terrorism.
[40:07.780 --> 40:13.120]  So they're completely worthless. And then the ultimate goal of course is to have these
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.520]  roving body scanners, which British Dutch authorities were talking about four or five
[40:19.520 --> 40:26.280]  years ago, where they could in fact install them on lamp posts, streetlights, which is
[40:26.280 --> 40:30.280]  very interesting considering the fact that IntelliStreets have come out with the new
[40:30.280 --> 40:38.360]  Orwellian streetlights, which record conversations, they double as CCTV cameras, billboards for
[40:38.360 --> 40:45.400]  homeland security, few mongering announcements. So it's all geared towards putting these mobile
[40:45.400 --> 40:51.760]  naked body scanners either in streetlights or on these roving vans, which go around your
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.720]  street, go down the highways and just randomly scan crowds of people completely against the
[40:57.720 --> 41:03.640]  fourth amendment, completely unsafe. All these top doctors have come out and said that it
[41:03.640 --> 41:07.600]  leads to an increase in cancer. And then when they do that, the TSA just comes back and
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.760]  says, no, John Hopkins said that there were no links to cancer whatsoever, even though
[41:12.760 --> 41:18.900]  they said the opposite. And then you've got Columbia University, University of California
[41:18.900 --> 41:25.800]  Interagency Committee on Radiation Safety, which is the premier radiation safety organization
[41:25.800 --> 41:31.480]  in the world. You've got MIT, you've got all these universities who come out and say, no,
[41:31.480 --> 41:36.800]  it's not safe and it is going to lead to an increase in cancer. And then the TSA always
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.320]  comes back, DHS and just says, no, they said that it's safe. So they just brazenly lie
[41:42.320 --> 41:48.180]  to the public time and time again. And now we've got this new story out of CNET, which
[41:48.180 --> 41:55.340]  is related to the borders. DHS x-ray scanners could be cancer risk to border crossers. So
[41:55.340 --> 42:00.440]  now it's going to be in that context. And it's unfolding out to every context of public
[42:00.440 --> 42:07.840]  life as the TSA becomes this occupying army. Now they've got the FPS, the Federal Bureau
[42:07.840 --> 42:14.680]  Protective Service, which is basically the DHS is occupying Gestapo Force. They turned
[42:14.680 --> 42:21.520]  up at a Florida social security office just over a week ago and started checking people's
[42:21.520 --> 42:29.160]  IDs, these DHS goons on with semi-automatic guns, while others drove around the block,
[42:29.160 --> 42:36.760]  cased the joint in DHS cars. So it's literally, I've called it an occupying force and it just
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.280]  manifests itself in more of those precise ways as we go along.
[42:41.280 --> 42:46.560]  Well, you know, it's martial law being rolled out incrementally until you're there. And
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.400]  it's all about setting the precedent to totally take over our society. And every movie you
[42:51.400 --> 42:56.580]  watch about an authoritarian society or every documentary you watch about real authoritarian
[42:56.580 --> 43:00.800]  societies, this is it. They're not even trying to hide it. And there are a bunch of crooks
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.800]  that deal drugs and ship guns into Mexico and engage in every other crime you can imagine.
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.560]  There's no doubt we have a treasonous criminal group running the government.
[43:09.560 --> 43:17.120]  And I mean, remember the story about, they were talking about fitting people, passengers
[43:17.120 --> 43:24.440]  on airplanes, completely innocent travelers going on their vacation with taser shock bracelets.
[43:24.440 --> 43:30.760]  So anytime some official in a position of authority got scared, they could just shock
[43:30.760 --> 43:36.360]  the entire plane into submission. I mean, these are the kind of ideas that these control
[43:36.360 --> 43:42.760]  freaks come out with. And go and watch the video for the fast screening program, DHS,
[43:42.760 --> 43:49.320]  which is where they erect all these mobile units outside public events. And they literally
[43:49.320 --> 43:55.040]  interrogate every single person before they're allowed into the event. It's a behavioral
[43:55.040 --> 44:00.640]  analysis of their facial reactions when they're asked certain questions. And that technology
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.680]  is now being announced is already in some airports and is going in many other major
[44:05.680 --> 44:12.200]  airports. So every incremental step just gets crazier and crazier and outstrips anything
[44:12.200 --> 44:15.760]  that you could read about in Orwell's 1984.
[44:15.760 --> 44:18.920]  But it's to keep us safe from the Al Qaeda that's been given control of Libya and is
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.680]  being funded to attack Syria. Thank you, Paul Watson. Great report. I want to get a big
[44:22.680 --> 44:28.120]  report out explaining to people that the system knows that they're giving people cancer with
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.420]  these scanners and maybe some screenshots of the different newscasts showing the families
[44:32.420 --> 44:37.160]  driving under the scanners with the military standing there being barbecued. Thank you,
[44:37.160 --> 44:38.160]  Paul Watson.
[44:38.160 --> 44:39.160]  Thanks Alex.
[44:39.160 --> 44:43.040]  All right, now I know I said I'd go to your calls and we are going to your calls. We're
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.640]  gonna go to Ezekiel, and then we're gonna go to Pat, and then we're gonna go to Chris,
[44:47.640 --> 44:52.320]  Chuck, Sean and others. Ezekiel in Kentucky, thanks for holding. I meant to go to your
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.560]  calls earlier, but I went crazy thinking about the cancer from all these scanners going in
[44:57.560 --> 44:59.560]  and how they know it's killing people.
[44:59.560 --> 45:04.200]  And just how psychopathically evil this is. Ezekiel, welcome.
[45:04.200 --> 45:09.800]  Thank you. I've got three quick questions for you and a comment. First about chemtrails.
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.320]  Last week over southwest Ohio, I witnessed the worst chemtrailing I've ever seen. I
[45:14.320 --> 45:20.280]  counted at least 18 high altitude sprayers before I lost track. I got some pictures.
[45:20.280 --> 45:25.040]  But I'm starting to believe now that they're using drones for this because I've been observing
[45:25.040 --> 45:30.280]  this for almost 10 years now, and recently I've been trying to use 10x binoculars to
[45:30.280 --> 45:36.160]  observe these planes. And even with binoculars, I still can get a clear visual on these craft.
[45:36.160 --> 45:40.480]  The first question is, do you think there's a connection between chemtrails and Project
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.240]  Blue Beam? And do you think Project Blue Beam could be implemented this year?
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.180]  All right, I appreciate your call. Project Blue Beam is a government program that part
[45:48.180 --> 45:52.440]  of it's been leaked to have a fake alien invasion to make the public do whatever the government
[45:52.440 --> 45:53.440]  says.
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.000]  It's a form of false flag staged event. I don't know. I know Hollywood's always getting
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.960]  the public ready for that. I know world leaders have said that it can be used someday. As
[46:02.960 --> 46:07.320]  for chemtrails, there's a whole bunch of different programs. There's low altitude, high altitude.
[46:07.320 --> 46:14.640]  The government admits that there are thousands of government tests going on for weather modification.
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.520]  But 99% of the activist community never looks at any of the admissions. They just speculate.
[46:19.520 --> 46:25.360]  But there's films on it. We've covered it. There is a geoengineering program going on.
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.440]  The White House science are admits they are. Pat in New York, you're on the air. Welcome.
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.760]  Hey, how's it going, man? Good, sir.
[46:34.760 --> 46:39.640]  I just wanted to get a little Ron Paul news out there. I actually just saw a video. I
[46:39.640 --> 46:43.880]  didn't believe it was yesterday. Tom Woods was talking about Operation Grandma. I don't
[46:43.880 --> 46:47.520]  know if you heard about this. No, tell me about it.
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.560]  It's about getting, it's about talking to your grandparents, your grandmothers and grandparents
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.840]  about Ron Paul because most of the time, they get most of that news from CNN, Fox News,
[46:57.840 --> 47:02.640]  all the mainstream media channels. My grandma has a computer in the house, but she never
[47:02.640 --> 47:10.720]  uses it. She always talks about Obama's doing good, but if Congress only worked with them.
[47:10.720 --> 47:15.400]  I started telling her about Ron Paul and how he's the only one that's not corruptible and
[47:15.400 --> 47:20.960]  just all this stuff. Operation Grandma, Thomas Woods actually talks about it. I just wanted
[47:20.960 --> 47:23.760]  to get that out there because- So you're saying go over to Grandma's house,
[47:23.760 --> 47:26.240]  get her computer working and show her Ron Paul videos.
[47:26.240 --> 47:30.400]  Exactly, either that or just talk to her about Ron Paul, what he's saying.
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.680]  Yeah, I agree. That's how you defeat tyrants is everybody talking to everybody. Everybody
[47:35.680 --> 47:38.840]  reaching out to each other and pointing out what's going on. Great points, good to hear
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.640]  from you. Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Michigan. Chuck, you're on the air.
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.000]  Hey, how you doing, Alex? I'm doing great, brother. How about you?
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.680]  I'm actually seeing some snow for the first time here in Michigan because they haven't
[47:52.680 --> 47:58.440]  sprayed for the past five days, but that's for another time. I wanted to talk about how,
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.840]  this is my personal belief, that Chicago is going to be turned into the Warsaw Ghetto
[48:03.840 --> 48:08.160]  due to the fact that it's a transportation hub and they keep wanting to do all this high
[48:08.160 --> 48:14.640]  speed rail. And as it is, all the rail lines in the entire country stem from Chicago.
[48:14.640 --> 48:21.440]  Well, an Indiana based news outfit called The Newspaper interviewed a right on the border
[48:21.440 --> 48:27.200]  Indiana County Commissioner. And I learned the guy's identity, but obviously we voice
[48:27.200 --> 48:32.640]  changed him and everything. When we got him on air one time for a short interview, it
[48:32.640 --> 48:35.720]  was taped interview and then he also did another interview.
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.680]  But I've since confirmed it and now a lot of it's actually come out. They've been training
[48:39.680 --> 48:46.800]  for millions of dead, locking down Chicago in the surrounding counties around it and
[48:46.800 --> 48:50.080]  around Illinois for a long time. Go ahead.
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.400]  Right. Why else would the president's right hand man, Rob Emanuel, take a job as a mayor?
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.880]  You know, I mean, that makes no sense whatsoever unless something sinister is up.
[48:59.880 --> 49:02.880]  Well, you can grandstand as the savior when the terrorists hit.
[49:02.880 --> 49:09.120]  Yeah, yeah. The boogeyman who lives 5,000 miles away. Anyways, I also wanted to talk
[49:09.120 --> 49:14.160]  a little quick story about something happened to me at the V.A. hospital about a year ago.
[49:14.160 --> 49:20.480]  I was down there and I seen a TSA agent and, you know, I got kind of a smart mouth and
[49:20.480 --> 49:24.960]  I said something to him. I said, so how many times have you stuck your hand down a five
[49:24.960 --> 49:31.600]  year old's pants this week? And this guy, like, he was about to swing on me and he started
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.320]  to push me and I just kept backing up. Luckily the V.A. police came and escorted this guy,
[49:35.320 --> 49:40.000]  but this guy was screaming at me like he wanted to kill me.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  And I mean, this guy. Well, how many have been busted now raping kids and dealing drugs
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.280]  and robbing people? And I mean, it's just look, only an idiot would take that job or
[49:50.280 --> 49:55.960]  a criminal. Oh, yeah. This guy, this guy had total anger issues. And I mean, it's all about
[49:55.960 --> 49:57.280]  his power over people.
[49:57.280 --> 50:03.280]  He's going to enjoy the power of being barbecued by that radiation. Yes, sir. I just I just
[50:03.280 --> 50:08.440]  luckily the V.A. police were on my side. They seem to be OK down there because most of them
[50:08.440 --> 50:15.240]  are expats, too, so. So he didn't like you ask him about sticking his hand down five
[50:15.240 --> 50:16.240]  year old's pants.
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.800]  I mean, that's his profession. I mean, literally, the psychologists are in mainstream news saying
[50:21.800 --> 50:27.360]  it's teaching kids to let pedophiles like Sandusky, I guess, have their way. It's like
[50:27.360 --> 50:32.360]  that testing they reportedly do. And so kids that have been trained to be touched. Well,
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.800]  now it's it's it's, I guess, fair game. And you're not you know, you're not supposed to

[54:46.140 --> 54:53.260]  us but I'm also going to play a clip from Andy Griffin show Mayberry just to show you
[54:53.260 --> 54:56.460]  how TV has changed since the 50s till now.
[54:56.460 --> 55:00.900]  I mean, just think about all the stuff that's there. It's all designed for mine rot basically
[55:00.900 --> 55:16.700]  to dumb the population down. One of my biggest problems is that I tend to focus on just the
[55:16.700 --> 55:22.900]  news propaganda. But the real propaganda is embedded in the culture, in the video games
[55:22.900 --> 55:27.900]  and the TV. That's where you see it. Let's go ahead and go to Sean, Illinois. Sean, you're
[55:27.900 --> 55:28.900]  on the air.
[55:28.900 --> 55:29.900]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[55:29.900 --> 55:30.900]  Hey, buddy.
[55:30.900 --> 55:38.660]  How's it going? Yeah, I just want to touch base. So you guys were talking about how,
[55:38.660 --> 55:43.140]  you know, they have these scanners now and, you know, the government denies the fact that
[55:43.140 --> 55:47.740]  they cause cancer. This takes people back to, you know, about like 50 years back when
[55:47.740 --> 55:53.020]  they used to spray DDT. They sprayed it from 1945 to 1970. They were saying that that at
[55:53.020 --> 55:56.980]  the time was actually perfectly healthy with nothing wrong with that. And then, you know,
[55:56.980 --> 56:01.340]  years later, they got people popular with cancer and stuff and they banned it completely.
[56:01.340 --> 56:05.380]  And my dad actually a while back was talking about this. And there's a video, I think it's
[56:05.380 --> 56:11.420]  under the rise and fall of DDT on YouTube. It actually shows a scientist who says, oh,
[56:11.420 --> 56:15.020]  there's nothing wrong with this. And he's eating DDT. He's literally eating pills of
[56:15.020 --> 56:18.900]  this to prove that there's nothing wrong with it. But come to find out it causes cancer.
[56:18.900 --> 56:23.980]  The same kind of thing is going on here. Like you got the scientists saying, no, this isn't
[56:23.980 --> 56:27.340]  going to do anything to you. But that's what they were saying back then. That guy probably
[56:27.340 --> 56:29.300]  died of that kind of sickness, you know?
[56:29.300 --> 56:36.420]  Well, to be clear, I've studied DDT in depth, so it's a little of both. The eugenicist wanted
[56:36.420 --> 56:43.100]  to ban it because it was saving about 15 million lives a year, but it did have some toxicity.
[56:43.100 --> 56:47.260]  And so the chemical company said it was perfectly fine. They showed kids playing in it with
[56:47.260 --> 56:51.900]  the DDT trucks driving around. My mother in Austin growing up, they would run behind the
[56:51.900 --> 56:54.660]  trucks with the DDT spraying out of it.
[56:54.660 --> 57:00.380]  And that was shown on the newsreels. But at the same time then when they banned it because
[57:00.380 --> 57:04.700]  it's such an inexpensive poison, it did cause massive deaths. So there's a cost benefit
[57:04.700 --> 57:10.820]  analysis there. But what about Agent Orange? What about the vaccines with cancer viruses
[57:10.820 --> 57:16.260]  in them? Again, a lot of this is on purpose.
[57:16.260 --> 57:19.420]  I feel like in 50 years from now, we're going to look back and they're going to say like
[57:19.420 --> 57:23.100]  all this stuff. You always hear people calling on your radio station about chemtrails, it's
[57:23.100 --> 57:27.900]  such a big deal. Here in Illinois, I see a woman on a daily basis outside of my house,
[57:27.900 --> 57:31.460]  like tons of them too just littering the sky. I feel like in 50 years from now, people are
[57:31.460 --> 57:34.940]  going to look back and say, the government's going to say, yeah, we made a mistake. It
[57:34.940 --> 57:38.380]  caused these kind of problems and we shouldn't have done it. It's going to be just like the
[57:38.380 --> 57:39.380]  DDT type of thing.
[57:39.380 --> 57:46.580]  Well, I agree with you and I appreciate your call. Look, expanding on that, we'll come
[57:46.580 --> 57:52.220]  back and take a few more calls and Gerald Cilente is going to join us. Expanding on
[57:52.220 --> 58:00.380]  that, a lot of times the threats they tell us about are minor issues or they're things
[58:00.380 --> 58:04.860]  that the patent is running out on and the establishment wants to charge you a lot more
[58:04.860 --> 58:05.860]  for something.
[58:05.860 --> 58:12.180]  The patent on Freon ran out. They had new systems to replace it, so they banned it claiming
[58:12.180 --> 58:17.740]  it was destroying the ozone layer. But one thing I know about the global controllers,
[58:17.740 --> 58:26.620]  they could care less about this planet. I mean, I go back to the 60s where they detonated
[58:26.620 --> 58:32.140]  the US alone, hundreds of high powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere.
[58:32.140 --> 58:36.660]  And it's even on the History Channel to see if they could ignite the planet's atmosphere.
[58:36.660 --> 58:38.500]  I mean, these are crazy people.
[58:38.500 --> 58:47.300]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.300 --> 58:54.740]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[58:54.740 --> 58:59.660]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[58:59.660 --> 59:02.340]  It really says that the state is God.
[59:02.340 --> 59:06.900]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[59:06.900 --> 59:12.460]  on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[59:12.460 --> 59:17.940]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[59:17.940 --> 59:22.700]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[59:22.700 --> 59:27.980]  depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[59:27.980 --> 59:33.940]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
[59:33.940 --> 59:38.660]  every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[59:38.660 --> 59:45.340]  The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at Infowars.com or

[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:12.300]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:22.980]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:29.780]  We call it Cedar, but it's really a juniper, a mountain juniper. And it's got the highest
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.220]  concentrations anywhere in the world here in central Texas. And it's in full bloom right
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.420]  now because I'm getting in shape, drinking plenty of water. I don't really feel bad from
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.900]  it, but it is. Taking my voice today, coding my larynx. I kind of lost my voice earlier,
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.580]  but we're gonna complete the transmission this evening.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.540]  And I've got Peter Schiff joining us on the nightly news tonight. A lot of breaking news.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.660]  I'll be there as well. But it'll be a good rest at least Saturday before I come back
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:01:00.460]  Sunday 4 to 6 PM with the Sunday radio show. But I'm just letting you know I lost my voice
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:05.820]  if it sounds a bit different there. Let's talk to Chris in North Carolina. Chris, you're
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:06.820]  on the air.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.700]  Hey, thank you, Alex. Can you hear me all right?
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:09.700]  Yes, I can. Welcome.
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:15.700]  I just wanted to say a couple things. First, exposing the liar, Mitt Romney. I think it
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.580]  was about last spring, he made a speech where he said that corporations should be people.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:26.220]  Then he said that he likes to fire people. And he tried to defend that by saying he didn't
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:31.340]  mean people. He meant insurance corporations. Sort of that circular insanity.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.900]  Well, Mitt Romney admits that he has been connected to groups that got banker bailouts.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.660]  And we played that clip yesterday where Luke Wadowski asked him about it. I mean, Mitt
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:46.780]  Romney is for carbon taxes for heaven's sakes. And now he gets up there and says he's against
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:52.820]  abortion and stuff. The establishment put Obama in because that's what they want.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.700]  The establishment wants to put Mitt Romney in because that's what they want. I mean,
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.860]  it's so elementary. If you want the status quo, which is tyranny and corruption, vote
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.020]  for anybody but Ron Paul. I mean, it's completely elementary.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:14.260]  On the police state from North Carolina, January 1st they just passed a law. If you get a DUI
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:19.220]  with passengers in the car, it's 30 days in jail, no questions asked. If they pull you
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.580]  over now or come to your house because they've had a complaint about a party and anybody
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.480]  has drugs on them, they go to everybody's house that's at the party.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.020]  And if you get pulled over in your car, they go to your house now. I don't know what they're
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.780]  using to justify that, but it's a coming. So everybody-
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.980]  Well, I wanna hear about this show. So they pull you over and somebody's got some marijuana
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:47.940]  in the car that George Washington grew and smoked. They, total drug war by the people
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.500]  that bring it in, it's so amazing.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.340]  They then go to your house? Tell me about this.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:57.660]  Well, I had a friend who got pulled over a couple of weeks ago. He had five grams of
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:04.580]  marijuana on him and they, I don't know that they're doing it legally. He kept complying
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:09.060]  with them, which is probably the problem, but you know how it is. I had another friend
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:15.700]  that was having a party. They came to the place because of a complaint about the noise.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.120]  Somebody there had some cocaine on them, I guess, but they went to everybody's house
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.540]  that was at the party. They just tell you they're gonna detain you until they get a
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.660]  warrant to come to your house. That's North Carolina.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:34.260]  Well, they wanna know where the cocaine is. Most of the police chiefs in every area are
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:41.220]  the main drug dealer. I mean, they're there to make sure all of it goes well. Again, they're
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:46.760]  the drug dealers and they have their low level minions go out and then enslave you when you
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.300]  buy their product to pay them more money.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:53.780]  Yes, it's not Mayberry any longer, buddy. Thank you so much.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.980]  Appreciate the points. We won't have time to go to another caller in this segment, but
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.060]  I'll take some of your calls. You can talk to Gerald Cilente and myself. You can address
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:09.020]  the question to either of us. Brian, Tim, Alaric, and Jeff and others. Alaric, that
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.380]  is a cool name.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:16.580]  That's the Visigoth chieftain that shacked Rome in 410. I wonder if that's a gnome de
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:25.100]  plume, or a gnome de guerre, or if Alaric in Nebraska is really named Alaric. My parents
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:32.740]  almost named me Alaric. And they almost named me Jerry after my grandfather too.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:38.780]  And if I was gonna be a girl, I was gonna be named Skylark. My parents really weren't
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:44.780]  hippies, but I guess they were leaning enough that direction. Skylark Jones. All right,
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:51.700]  we're gonna be right back, my friends. I do like Skylarks, though. That was one reason
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.860]  I didn't like moving out of my last house, is he had these beautiful little blue and
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.700]  gold larks.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:06.540]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:11.720]  opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Cowbend Pure Soap Company
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.060]  can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.100]  triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:27.420]  and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials. Your
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:33.660]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:37.560]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.500]  had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:04.660]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.660]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:19.260]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:23.740]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:29.340]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.540]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.680]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:47.020]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:09.380]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. We are now eight
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:15.300]  minutes into the second hour of this worldwide transmission. We're going to transforecaster
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:20.020]  and frequent guest and a good friend of mine, Gerald Cilente, here in a moment. Here's a
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:25.380]  big story we haven't really gotten to yet that's very important. The Jerusalem Post
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.380]  is reporting on this.
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:33.060]  We have some of the backstory on it at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Ex-Israeli intelligence
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:39.940]  officer Pearl Harbor style attack will be pretext for war with Iran. What is the former
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:45.420]  top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush said? Ray McGovern, same
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:51.460]  thing. Jerusalem Post article implies US will stage provocation to justify military assault.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:57.300]  Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com. Former Israeli intelligence officer A.V. Perry writes that
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:02.740]  a surprise Pearl Harbor style Iranian attack on an American warship in the Persian Gulf
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:08.580]  will provide the pretext for the US to launch all out warfare against Iran.
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:13.300]  Given the fact that former Vice President Dick Cheney's office openly considered staging
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:18.660]  a false flag attack on a US vessel in the Persian Gulf to blame it on Iran as a pretext
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:26.180]  for war. Perry's summation of how 2012 will see a new war cannot be taken lightly. Under
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.620]  the headline looming war with Iran, Perry writes, and it goes over it all.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:37.220]  I just wanna say something here. Iran, Israel, China, Russia, the US, England, they're all
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:41.860]  run by mafias. And all of these big mafias, the world's gotten in a very corrupt cycle.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:46.260]  I don't get Gerald Cilenti's take on this is why I'm raising it. Studying history, we've
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:51.780]  gotten in a very corrupt cycle worldwide. And as the corruption goes to seed and the
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:56.980]  society starts collapsing, the criminals are gonna steal even faster.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:01.320]  Because they have nothing to lose now. And that's what always accelerates tyranny into
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:07.300]  the absurdist realm, which is now happening. But tyrants always wrap themselves in the
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:12.420]  flag. If anybody criticizes them, they say, you're just anti-German or you're anti-Russian
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:18.380]  or you're anti-Israel or you're anti-England or you're anti-China or you're anti-America.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.840]  It's the same formulas, the same tricks, the same playbooks. They all cheat each other
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:29.300]  as well, these big Fortune 100. They're a bunch of crooks, as Gerald Cilenti's pointed
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:35.700]  out. And the point is, the crooks won a big war. As Gerald said a year ago, he said, as
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:40.120]  things accelerate, as things implode, look for the first great war.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.900]  That was his trend of 2011, his top trend back in January of last year. Now he has his
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:51.800]  new big Trends Journal out. You can get a Trends Journal website if you wanna find out
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:58.140]  a lot more. And we have the 12-point breakdown, it's trendsresearch.com. And you can see right
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.080]  there on the cover of it, if you guys will zoom in for prisonplanet.tv viewers, it says
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.960]  the Trends Journal, the Trends Research Institute, forecasting worldwide since 1980, wanted enemy
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.960]  of the state.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.740]  Gerald Cilenti wanted for speaking the truth. This is just a black and white print off from
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:19.060]  our computer, we might show the color one later. And it says America with a KUSSA by
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:25.060]  Department of Homeland Security. And joining us for the rest of the hour is Gerald Cilenti.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.680]  Gerald, great to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.640]  It's always a pleasure being on with you, Alex.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.840]  So they now admit that there's a war already going on, what we knew years ago, covertly
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.700]  in Iran. Things are escalating. What's on the front burner for Gerald Cilenti right
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.320]  now? Out of the gates, what's most important?
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.660]  It is Iran. It's number one. There are two number ones. It's what's going on in Europe,
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:54.700]  the meltdown of the European Economic Union, and the Iranian war that they're building
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:01.880]  up. They declared war, Alex, with Obama when he signed on New Year's Eve, the National
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:08.380]  Defense Authorization Act. He also declared war against Iran, essentially, by making it
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:14.640]  impossible for businesses to do business with the Iranian bank, who clears the deals to
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:22.700]  sell oil. And so already we've just heard from Japan, they said, according to the reports
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:29.620]  that they're going to cut back on buying Iranian oil. Timothy Geithner just went to China and
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:38.580]  tried to strong on the Chinese into not buying Iranian oil. 22% of Iranian oil goes to China.
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:44.380]  The European Economic Union, the Eurozone, they have already announced that they're going
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:52.100]  to stop buying Iranian oil. It's an act of war. It's a reverse of what happened as they're
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:59.180]  talking about what Pearl Harbor, I mean, people, if they know their history a little bit, the
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:05.300]  United States stopped Japan from buying oil. And now what they're doing is they're stopping
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:15.800]  Iran from selling their oil, and over 60% of Iran's GDP comes from selling oil. So we
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:24.620]  can see what's being set up here. Imagine this. Imagine if Iran put sanctions on companies
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:33.460]  doing business with America. Oh, my God, would there be some outrage going on?
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:42.620]  No, I did. I did notice that all of this is unfolding. In fact, while you were talking,
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:47.100]  Rob Dew just walked in and handed this to me. It's why I was distracted for a moment.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:53.380]  It's on another issue, Gerald, but it ties in to just the rampant criminality. Here is
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:59.380]  a story out of Reuters. MF Global may not be able to pay clients back, the trustee says,
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:04.340]  Gerald. And so here we are two, three months into this, two and a half months into this,
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.740]  and now they're just saying, we don't know where the money is. Most of you won't get
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:14.780]  your money back. And by the way, Corzine, the White House advisor, got caught lying
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.180]  in Congress, but nobody gets in trouble. I mean, doesn't that just green light all sorts
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:24.420]  of new crime? Well, exactly. It's a criminal operation.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:30.260]  As Corzine, I love the headline, he's looking for a new place to start up business. How
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:36.340]  about Sing Sing? Again, when you look at the prostitutes and how they cover this, imagine
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:42.940]  if you or I or anybody listening breaks a minor crime, you know, they'll crash down
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:49.460]  your doors and drag you away. Could you imagine not being able to find money on your tax return?
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:55.980]  How they'd be hounding you to death and going back and talking about this criminality and
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:01.780]  tying it together. Here's what's going on, as I said, in Europe, because what, as we,
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:09.140]  we made this forecast based upon, as you mentioned a year ago, the collapse coming, the cover-up.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:14.920]  It's not a recovery. We said it was a cover-up. And if you look back and you hear the European
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:20.260]  central banker at the time, the head trichet, a couple of years ago saying that the Greek
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:26.140]  problem was solved, they would handle it. And now of course, I mean, you can't make
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:38.620]  this stuff up, Alex. This is yesterday's Financial Times. Here's the headline. ECB sees signs
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:47.540]  of let up in debt crisis. This is yesterday. Today, guess what? We have a debt crisis again.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:54.940]  And here's what they're saying over there in Greece. This is from the Australian. Banks
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:16:04.180]  say no deal on Greek debt, quote, there has been no agreement on any Greek deal or a specific
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:13.800]  haircut, says Charles Dalra, head of the Institute of International Finance, which represents
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:23.120]  banks in the EU negotiation. We remain open to a dialogue in search of a voluntary agreement.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:29.780]  Now let's make this clear so everyone could understand this BS language. The banks made
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:38.180]  bad bets. It's as simple as that. Because they made bad bets, they don't want to take
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:45.420]  a haircut. You make a bad bet. Hey, you know what we'll call that, Alex? Capitalism. How
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:52.620]  about that? But not when the banks do it. They don't want to take a haircut because
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:59.980]  the white shoe boys don't want to take a trimming. Instead, they're going to screw you and grab
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:05.420]  the money from you, from the Greeks, from the Italians, from the Americans, from the
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:11.700]  French, from the German, from everybody. So what do they do? I got it. Austerity measures.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:17.280]  How's that for a nice word? It kind of conjures up those feelings of, you know, doing the
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:25.220]  right thing. Yeah, like raising taxes, cutting benefits, cutting pensions, cutting services
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:31.140]  and increasing the cost of services, raising taxes as you're losing money and increasing
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:38.520]  the retirement age until after you're dead. So now what is happening is the whole system
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.860]  is collapsing. They are now, we're hearing reports that are coming out today, as you
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:51.180]  know, that they're going to be downgrading French and Austrian debt, just like they did
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:56.660]  in the US. What does that mean? The credit rating is being low. So the very bankers that
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:01.420]  engineered all this, who are the recipients of our bailout, that's our tax money, they
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:06.300]  then lower your government's credit rating and you pay them higher interest on the money
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:13.900]  you gave them that they loan back to you. Exactly. And that's why they call them the
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:21.940]  money changers, the loan sharks. Again, the people that Jesus Christ beat out of the temple
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:30.100]  with a whip and turned over their tables. The money changers are in charge like a slime
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:38.460]  ball like cause line. And it keeps going on. I'm sure Alex, that you read the latest reports
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:47.600]  that just came out. Again, this goes under the headlines of, you can't make this up.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:54.480]  And here's the latest one. It's about those wonderful boys at the Federal Reserve, how
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:03.860]  they called it wrong in 2006. You had the transcripts of people like Timothy Geithner
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:13.340]  saying, quote, we just don't see troubling signs yet of collateral damage. And we are
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:22.100]  not expecting much. Oh, we aren't, aren't we? The wheeze, the white shoe weasels. That's
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:30.580]  who wheeze is. There's one after another. This is the cat that's running the treasury.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:37.940]  And I love the language as it keeps going on. You'd like to grab these guys by the throat
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:43.920]  and say, who are you talking to? I'd like the record to show Geithner goes on to say
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.420]  how wonderful Greenspan is. Oh yes, stay there. So one little mafia minions telling us how
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:56.220]  great the retired Don did, how they helped everybody. They handed out free turkeys on
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:01.020]  Thanksgiving, the very people they were shaking down.

[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:41.940]  on with us tonight, one of Ron Paul's top financial advisors on his economic policy.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:45.500]  Now going back to Gerald Cilente in the short segment, more news and your calls coming up
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:51.380]  with Gerald in the next. Gerald you were getting into how this disgusting crew of admitted
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:58.220]  miscreant Ponzi scheme operators always are constantly giving each other awards, worshiping
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:03.340]  each other for what they've done, promising to never devalue the dollar as they do it,
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:07.660]  lying 24-7 and hurtling us towards collapse.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:11.980]  Give us your latest breakdown on the acceleration of the world depression because you know a
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.340]  few years ago the New York Times would say you were a pessimist porn dealer. Now they
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:21.460]  say, okay, we never had a recovery. The question is, will it be a global recession or depression?
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:25.060]  But according to you and many other analysts I talked to, for the average folks, we've
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.780]  been in a depression for a long time.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:32.420]  Anybody that goes shopping knows what the deal is. I mean, these guys are so out of
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:39.100]  touch with what's going on. And of course we are. You know, you look at the data. What
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:45.100]  is the gap between the rich and the poor in America? You know, it's like Zimbabwe or something.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.980]  And that's according to the CIA fact book. Anybody could go look this up. Look at the
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:56.140]  decline according to official estimates. You know, household income, median household income
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:00.540]  has collapsed 10% since this thing began at the panic of 08.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:05.740]  I really want to read these quotes so that people could understand who's in charge.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:10.080]  Start over with the Greenspan worship. Well, here's one over here from Bernanke. Now this
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:16.660]  is as the markets are collapsing. I'm out there saying the real estate bubble is burst.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:23.020]  And here's the quote from Bernanke quote. I agree with most of the commentary that the
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:32.540]  strong fundamentals support a relatively soft landing in housing. If this was me or you,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:41.220]  we would be fired. But no, this guy's put her the prostitutes, bow down, suck up, kiss
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:49.260]  up. Mr. Bernanke, sir. Chairman, sir. Hey, about how could anybody be so wrong? Here's
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:58.960]  another great one from our esteem treasury secretary. Check it out. Quote, we think the
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:08.000]  fundamentals of the expansion going forward still look good. Oh, we do. Do we? What you
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:16.380]  mean I'm weak? Kimo Sabe, not me, not other people. We're weeding with Peter Schiff, Paul
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:21.440]  Craig Roberts, Mark Farber. You know, there were a lot number of us that said this thing
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:28.180]  was collapsing, but the wheeze in this are astounding. And I want to make this point
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:36.140]  because Alex, it's the same wheeze on the military end that know what they're doing.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:44.380]  Oh, how no one saw this coming. We are going to get into war with Iran. Look what just
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:51.220]  happened with Iraq. Hey, did you see all those victory parades? You must have missed a big
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:58.220]  one. I wonder where Bloomberg was with his with his American shirt on and Lady Gaga to
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:03.980]  welcome home the troops of Iraq on on Wall Street with all the confetti falling. I didn't
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:11.780]  see it happening. The same losers in the military are going to do the same thing that the losers
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:18.180]  on the financial end are going to do. You know, there's been a lot of press out there
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:24.920]  about I heard Panetta saying that our trade our first he was CIA that he's now he's the
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:31.260]  head of the Defense Department saying how despicable it is that our troops were urinating
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.060]  on the dead Taliban.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:40.460]  How about this deplorable, he said. How about despicable it is that you sent them over there?
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:46.580]  How about how despicable it is? These guys are dead. How about waterboarding people?
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:52.100]  I was about to say, Gerald, it makes me think of the line from Full Metal, not Full Metal
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:29:01.660]  Jacket Apocalypse Now, where he's talking to Colonel Kurtz. And he says, yeah, we give
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:06.380]  our troops to merits for writing cuss words on airplanes.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:10.980]  But then we tell him to drop fire bombs on little villages full of children. I mean,
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:16.140]  there it is torture, murder, drones, killing whole families to kill one quote bad guy.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:21.340]  All this evil. And then and then they obsess over, oh, my gosh, they urinated on corpses.
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:26.980]  Yeah, what a bunch of baloney this is. And these are young kids and they believe this
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:33.660]  crap that people like, you know, the our secretary of this and that are telling us.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:38.620]  Well, stay there. We got a break. Come back with that on the other side. And let's continue
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:43.460]  and look at how fast you see things unraveling. Go back into Iran and phone calls. Gerald
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:50.100]  Cilentes, our guest. It's Friday the 13th. Stay with us.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:57.260]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:06.700]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator. Now

[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:16.480]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:21.500]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The silver lungs generator
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:27.980]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:33.460]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:39.180]  sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:44.380]  with the silver lungs generator. Very easy to follow. Step by step instructions are provided
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:51.100]  making production fast and simple. Go to www dot silver lungs dot com today and learn more

[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:11.940]  our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:18.540]  the rug from underneath Americans at home, tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:23.780]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:29.100]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:34.660]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.700]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.140]  matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make a check out to today? Seems like nobody
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:49.660]  does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:55.980]  copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com or watch it online right now
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:02.500]  in super high quality at prison planet dot TV. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.940]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:11.100]  Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:14.980]  than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:19.300]  this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:24.580]  from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:30.460]  seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:34.700]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.

[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:57.320]  zero three six five. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:01.900]  This is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:19.940]  OK, we're going back to Gerald Cilente and his trends for 2012 and breaking down some
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:24.740]  of the latest news and then your phone calls here in just a moment. I want to remind listeners

[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:49.860]  So I want to thank all of you. It's been out of print for over a year. It's back with an
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:54.960]  updated and abridged edition, the deliberate dumbing down of America, almost 500 pages
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:01.100]  long full of documents. This every teacher, every school board person needs to see this
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:05.860]  to understand why the dumbing down of America has been by design and it's discounted out
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:08.720]  of the gates at info wars dot com.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:15.080]  We also have the incredible film exposing Oklahoma City as an inside job. This is like
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:20.440]  holy water on a vampire. For people that don't understand what false flag terror is, get
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:27.220]  it out to everybody. It's called noble lie available at info wars.com and we have all

[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:52.460]  news and all the films and everything else right there at prison planet.tv. And of course
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:58.060]  I'll be back tonight with Peter Schiff 7 o'clock central at prison planet.tv or infowarsenews.com
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.740]  will take you there.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:03.720]  Now going back to Gerald Salente, Gerald, I've been throwing some of the questions out
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.480]  here and you were getting into Afghanistan and these diversions, but I totally concur
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:13.700]  with you. They'll have this weird moral idea of torture, secret arrest, kill 200 people
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:20.300]  to kill one bad guy. Let 40,000 blacks be killed or injured because they're black in
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:23.060]  Libya by Western funded Al Qaeda.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:29.500]  All of this comes out and it's moral and loving with left cover under Obama. But then some
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:34.400]  troops urinate on dead bodies and I'm not saying that's a good thing to do, but that's
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.100]  just clap. I mean, usually wars, raping, murder, stuff even worse. And then they obsess over
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:44.940]  it and moralize like they're these goody two shoes up there.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:53.540]  I mean, it's clearly a psychological operation. Well, again, it's exactly that because the
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:36:03.560]  same metaphor could be applied to, you have a big guy like John, the slime cause line
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:12.280]  that can't find $1.2 billion. And you see him at these phony little house hearings over
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:19.060]  there with the name in front of them, honorable John cause line. But then somebody, you know,
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:24.700]  you or I or anybody out there, we have a minor infraction. We're going to come down with
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:29.620]  the strong arm of the law to show us that we have to obey.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:35.820]  So these soldiers are the pawns for these criminals that sent them over there. It's
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:42.420]  a despicable act to have invaded Afghanistan. It's a despicable act to have started the
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:48.340]  war in Iraq. How come there's no war crime tribunals? It's clear as can be. I saw that
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:56.540]  Ron Paul, it's going all over the internet, the one on the war in Iraq. You hear from
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:02.740]  Colin Powell, how you hear from Bush, how you hear from Rumsfeld, how you hear from
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:10.820]  Cheney say, it's clear all the evidence is there, man. This guy has weapons of mass destruction.
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:16.700]  There's some of the worst on earth and they're going to get us. How come nobody's bringing
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:23.740]  them in for questioning? It's the same thing. The criminals that started are the ones that
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:31.620]  blame us for the problems because it all ties together. Alex, what's going on in Europe
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:37.140]  with the collapse of the European monetary union that's happening in front of us, what
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:43.900]  they do and the same thing back here in the States, the bigger their screw ups, the more
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:51.900]  it costs, the more they clamp down on us. So that's what you're seeing at every level,
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:57.900]  whether it's at war, whether it's in the economy, whether it's in socialist, as Ron Paul again
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:03.460]  says when they call him a racist, he's out there saying, you don't see any rich people
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:11.900]  getting electrocuted. You don't see the rich people like John, the slime, cause I'm doing
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:20.940]  any time. It's the minorities, it's the poorer people. It's one after another. It's all ties
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.180]  together.
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:27.700]  Well, Gerald, I want to go to calls here, but what are some of the other big trends
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:32.460]  you're looking at right now? Well, right now, you know, those are the ones that we all have
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:38.300]  to pay attention to. And of course there's this whole election that's going on and the
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:45.140]  disgrace that they call the media. You know, I suffered through watching this stuff as
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:52.780]  you do. And you see how they marginalize Ron Paul. And one of, I have to tell you, you
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:39:00.740]  know, all my life I've been watching this. I've never heard a greater speech than his
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:06.660]  after the New Hampshire primary. It was natural. It was real. We're sitting together with our
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:11.700]  staff. And as soon as Romney came on, I looked at them. I said, this cat's talking from a
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:17.540]  teleprompter. You see the way the cameras were set and his cadence and sure enough,
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:24.140]  that's what it was. And one after another, they were dead. Ron Paul hits it. He was alive.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:30.460]  And one thing he said, among other things that really stuck out, he's calling for an
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:38.180]  intellectual revolution. Sound familiar? It's a call that I made a number of years ago.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:47.220]  We sent out a trend alert and wrote about it in 2009. We even took out the domain name,
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:56.460]  intellectualrevolution.com back in 2009. So this is the direction for the future. It has
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:04.740]  to be one of brains and clearly the nitwits at the treasury, they don't have the brains.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:10.660]  I just want to read this to you briefly, Alex, because it puts things in, puts things into
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:17.260]  perspective of how we're being brainwashed. And this is from, of course, the Tarlet paper
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:27.220]  of record. The transcripts of the 2006 meetings clearly show some of the nation's preeminent
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:36.820]  economic minds did not fully understand the economy, that they were in charge of supervising
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:42.740]  the most preeminent minds. What a bunch of beltway wankers.
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:49.460]  Well, no, that's what they do. They have this appeal to experts and they roll out paid hacks
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:54.880]  and they'll say, is it credible that Ron Paul, I saw this on the news last week, says that
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.540]  Israel created Hamas? And the lady says, no, it's not credible. When Israel admits that
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:04.940]  they did, it's like saying, is it credible Ron Paul said that ducks have beaks?
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:11.560]  And she goes, no, everyone knows they have the mouths of wolves. And they're like, see,
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:16.500]  is it credible that Ron Paul says the sky is blue? And she's like, no. And it's this
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:22.120]  where they sit there like con artists in plain view and tell us what reality is. Since you
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:26.860]  mentioned it, Gerald, the whole thing's up at Infowars.com. I want to play part of it.
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:33.020]  New Ron Paul ad war propaganda that we posted on Infowars yesterday. Here it is.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:41.060]  We're going to find out massive evidence of weapons of mass destruction, massive evidence
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.700]  of weapons of mass destruction. All those things that you predict are going to come
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:49.180]  true and a lot of people that have been laying out the case against us are going to be very
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.180]  embarrassed.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:54.060]  The intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraqi
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:42:01.020]  regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised provided
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:06.780]  training in these weapons to Al Qaeda. Listen, these folks are determined. These are killers.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:11.420]  They chop people's heads off. They get, they're getting money from around the world. They're
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:18.540]  getting recruits. It turned out as we discovered later that a lot of the sourcing that had
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:24.300]  been attested to by the intelligence community was wrong. I deeply regret that the information
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.460]  I presented with multisource was wrong.
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:30.700]  We thought he had weapons of mass destruction. It turns out he didn't. Those weapons of mass
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.340]  destruction got to be somewhere.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.420]  18 people were killed in Iraq.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.900]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:41.020]  As many as four people are dead and 15 wounded after a car bomb exploded on Tuesday.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.020]  Maybe under here.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.020]  Very embarrassed.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:47.340]  In light of the fact that we did not find the weapons of mass destruction, would you
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:50.900]  do the same thing all over again? Would you do the same thing all over again?
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:56.540]  We rested our case on the existence of weapons of mass destruction. I think without the weapons
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:00.740]  of mass destruction case, the justification would not have been there.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:07.820]  It has nothing to do with national security. Matter of fact, our national security is more
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:14.820]  jeopardized by permitting this to happen because we're liable to start a war. We're liable
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:22.180]  to have our military men killed. We're liable to have more attacks on us by terrorists.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.500]  I do not think it's effective. I think it drums up more anti-American hostility.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:33.460]  I see no threat to our national security. There's no convincing evidence that Iraq is
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:40.100]  capable of threatening the security of this country. Very little reason, if any, to pursue
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.900]  a war.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.020]  The Iranians have repeatedly said they want to wipe Israel off the map.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.860]  Take military action to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:53.860]  You have to take whatever steps are necessary to break its capacity to have a nuclear weapon.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:58.380]  The Iranians are the existential threat to the state of Israel.
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:05.140]  Without a shadow of a doubt, Iran will take a nuclear weapon. They will use it to wipe
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:09.380]  our ally, Israel, off the face of the map.
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:12.860]  It's another Iraq coming. There's war propaganda going on.
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:17.180]  To me, the greatest danger is that we will have a president that will overreact.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:19.620]  Washington's enemy is an enemy that doesn't exist.
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:25.940]  This wild goal to have another war in the name of defense is the dangerous thing.
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:30.740]  There is nothing that indicates that Iran is really building a bomb.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.020]  They produced information that led you to believe that, but they have no evidence.
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.140]  We might not be able to trust the IAEA.
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:42.020]  They say that the source is actually a single source, and the sourcing was wrong, will not
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.980]  tell us where that source is coming from at all.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.140]  The providence of that source has not been established.
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:53.380]  Just like we did Iraq, build up the war propaganda. There was no Al Qaeda in Iraq. It's time we
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:55.380]  quit this.
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:57.020]  All right.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:00.460]  And the real Al Qaeda has been given Libya.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:05.820]  Gerald, I played that clip because you brought it up, but I mean, how do they square? We've
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.940]  got to attack anybody who might get a nuke.
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:12.860]  Let's say they might get a nuke. I mean, do we attack Pakistan, Russia, China? This idea
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:19.340]  that we attack somebody before they attack, and then our government blows up their military
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:21.260]  bases as they admit is happening.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:26.660]  And that's loving and liberal to assassinate people, and then torturing people is good.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.020]  And then the American people that go along with the war, Gerald, do they think they're
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:34.380]  going to be safe when there's no Bill of Rights or Constitution?
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:37.260]  I mean, these protections are there for a reason.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:44.420]  Well, again, that's why one of the reasons we have one of our top trends of 2012, Battlefield
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:45.420]  America.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:52.620]  Now, as you well know that after signing the National Defense Authorization Act on New
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:58.860]  Year's Eve when no one was paying attention, and most people don't knowing what is in that,
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:03.660]  they could call the term is in there, belligerence. You and I, we're pretty belligerent.
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:08.100]  They could take us away and kill us. And I believe they're doing this because they do
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:13.780]  see the collapse coming, and they are going to start a war. They're already doing it.
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:19.580]  They declared war. They're cutting them out from not making a buck. It's an embargo. It's
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.140]  clear as that.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:26.420]  And the point that I want to keep making is that the same type of incompetence that is
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:34.340]  in clear view for everyone to read that comes from the economic end, the incompetence and
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:41.700]  stupidity and arrogance that we just heard from Bush, from Colin Powell, from Rumsfeld.
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:48.020]  I love Rumsfeld. They chop people's heads off. Hey, guess what? I think somebody chop
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:54.420]  your cojones off, Donald. I'm sick and tired of these fat mouths like Gingrich over there.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:47:01.340]  We have to go bomb. What do you mean we? I mean, this guy can't run up a flight of stairs.
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:06.260]  What do you mean we? And here's the sickness and the immorality because they're sending
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:11.820]  young guys to do this. These guys are coming back realizing that they're going through
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:19.220]  all these tours of duty for nothing and being put in these terrible conditions and their
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:26.260]  lives threatened. They're drugged out on prescription drugs. They're coming back home.
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:32.220]  And what's here for them? Nothing, nothing. I read something that the unemployment rate
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:37.060]  among our vets is over 30 percent and they don't want to go to the V.A. And you know
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:43.680]  why they don't want to go to the V.A.? Because they just saw how the military shafted them
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:50.300]  and they don't trust the V.A. So it's a morality issue here. It's as clear as that.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:54.600]  Now we've got a bunch of crooks that are cynical and think everything's a joke, think the party's
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.380]  going to never end. I want to go to some calls, but look at this economic news. Now, you and
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:03.380]  I and others get criticized for pointing out that according to all classical economic numbers,
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:10.820]  we're in a depression, U.S. debt nears $15.94 trillion. That's more than the GDP every year.
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:15.660]  Here's one out of Forbes, the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression. Now they
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.700]  call it the greatest recession. You got to love how they spin 50 million Americans on
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:27.860]  electronic soup kitchen, food stamps, and they just keep shoveling this bull at us.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:32.700]  And it's become totally see through. But they're up there saying, let them eat cake. I don't
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:39.020]  see them getting away with this, Gerald. Well, no. And again, this election is the most important
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:45.980]  in our lifetime. It's it can go. Alex, I've never felt more confident about a new year
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:54.860]  than 2012. The vacuum is so huge. Anyone can see through the lies. Again, front page story
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:49:01.500]  about how the Fed didn't see it coming and lied to us simultaneously. The clip that you
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:09.100]  just played of Ron Paul, how they lied to us. People see it. You're 100 percent correct.
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:15.580]  The future is in our hands. It's a moral issue. It's not a political issue.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:21.140]  A lot of the criminality that we have in our government flows all these problems. It's
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:25.900]  now coming out the Monsanto. We already knew this, but now it's confirmed actually owns
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:33.460]  most of the ambassadors and pays them. And so they'll give a country some giant concession
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:38.500]  that hurts other industries just to get what Monsanto wants through. I mean, there's just
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:44.780]  no end to this espionage. This is corporate globalist espionage through our government.
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:49.700]  Look at how Goldman Sachs runs all the country ministers that they're gutting. I mean, it's
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:56.140]  real simple. It's a hijacking. Again, as I said, you know, it's as old as the scriptures.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:01.260]  The money changes are in charge. It's the love of money being the root of all evil.
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:06.860]  I just didn't make that one up right now. And you can look at it. The ties are the same.
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:11.440]  Look at the war profiteers in this Iraq war. Oh, they'll come up. They can't find eighty
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:17.460]  five billion dollars. And what's for lunch? I mean, come on. It's one thing after another.
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:22.060]  And again, as I said, we have a gang of five thirty five senators and congressmen running
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:28.740]  the show. But now I see videos every day where a woman just says, oh, you're a big tough
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.740]  guy to a cop.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:34.100]  So he punches her in the face and the police chief defends it. Or where they beat somebody
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.900]  up for filming them. I mean, they throw the book at you for not even having a crooked
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:42.520]  toenail if you don't suck their boots properly. I mean, but then meanwhile, the criminals
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:49.300]  are running rampant. You got it. And that's what happens in third world countries. Look
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:53.160]  again, the gap between the rich and the poor.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:51:02.900]  When I began my career in the 1970, my first real job, the gap between the CEO and the
[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:10.340]  average worker was twenty four to one. Now it's about four hundred and fifty to one.
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:16.300]  You look at today, yesterday's news, how much these three guys in the Carlisle group, you
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:23.420]  know, is politically tied hedge fund, private equity firm like one hundred million each
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:29.780]  or something. And then you see the tax rate that they pay. They pay. They don't they don't
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:34.020]  pay it on a personal level. No, no. It's a capital gains tax. No, it's not. You're just
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:40.580]  doing deals. You're paying 15 percent. We have to pay much more. We're in the thirty
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:41.580]  five percent range.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:47.980]  The whole game is rigged by the money changers. It's as simple as that. But I want to make
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:55.300]  it clear because you brought it up. People are seeing through this. The future is in
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:52:04.900]  our hands. It's ours to have. And I have to say I have never been so pro a candidate as
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:10.020]  I am. And I make this clear. I don't agree with Ron Paul on a lot of libertarian issues.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:15.260]  I want the CFTC, the Commodity Future Trading Commission. I want the SEC.
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:20.340]  The point is he is an outsider. The system is attacking him. And that right there lets
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:24.220]  you know that's why he's the man for the job. And look at how they're throwing everything
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:30.580]  they've got at him. And he would be the candidate presumptive winner for the nomination if they
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.380]  weren't throwing everything they had.
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:37.960]  But despite that, he's still rising and they are pulling their hair out. They relish the
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:44.520]  prostitutes to the coin you termed the term you coined that that they can't just tell
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:49.740]  us what reality is now. We don't just fall down on our knees and worship these little
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.980]  chicken neck teleprompter readers when they lied to us.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:57.420]  I want to go to some calls here, but make a comment on the prostitutes running out of
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:53:00.580]  bullets and just discrediting themselves in the process.
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:04.780]  Oh, yeah. I mean, you see it all the time. What's this guy? This guy King was a John
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:11.160]  King, Queen and his wife, Donna Bash. It's on the video. Her saying how worried she was
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:17.140]  in the Republicans is CNN that if Ron Paul wins, you know, if he keeps going. And the
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:24.780]  other issue here and I want to make this really clear. Four more years of Obama.
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:31.680]  People are going to wish that Bush was back. Unbelievable. Let's go to Brian in North Carolina
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:36.140]  and then we'll go to Jeff and Alaric and everybody else. Brian, you're on the air.
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:41.140]  Hey, Gerald and Alex. I got a quick question for the both of you.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:48.820]  What do you think about E1 Corporation's YouTube worldwide blockade of not just your 2000 sub
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:55.300]  documentary in-game blueprint for global enslavement, but they could censor the Obama deception
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:54:00.940]  which you and Gerald Spilante were both on. Oh, yeah. I mean, there's big calls for Internet
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:06.500]  censorship going on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's one of our top trends. Big Brother Internet.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:11.860]  Oh, no. Look, I'm telling you, the bigger their screw ups, the harder they clamp down
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:17.060]  on us. You know, what are you going to see? Maybe, you know, a wheelchair granny bomber,
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:20.520]  a Brazilian bomber. They're going to make something up where they're going to start
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.520]  a war.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:27.000]  And it'll be an excuse to clamp down more on our freedoms. How much more clamp down
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.300]  than you need than the National Defense Authorization Act?
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:38.940]  Well said. Thank you so much, Brian. Good, good, good questions. Anything else?
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:43.700]  I sent it to your news tip email so you can look at all the screenshots of the censorship
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:44.700]  going on.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:50.300]  All right. We'll look it up. Thank you. Let's go to Alaric in Nebraska and then Jeff. Alaric
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.300]  here on the air. Go ahead.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:58.820]  Yeah, I'm really glad you guys talked about the censorship of Ron Paul. Here's a couple
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:03.740]  of news items. I got four small things. One is Virginia. They apparently closed their
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:10.140]  primary so that now you have to be registered. Also, the judge has backtracked and said that
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.420]  the other candidates, not just Romney and Ron Paul, will be allowed on it, but all of
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.620]  the other ones as well.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:21.180]  Yeah, yeah. Ron Paul goes out and actually qualifies for all the states. The others don't
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:25.380]  need to now. That way they can try to sap his vote. I did see that. And they've got
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:29.620]  people all over every channel saying he cannot win. He will not win. Talking down to their
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:30.620]  viewers.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:35.660]  I know it's just totally disgusting. Where's this guy? O'Donnell? One of these guys call
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:40.300]  them a fraud. This guy Schultz babbling on every one of them.
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:45.380]  Yeah, he said Huntsman really won. This is on MSNBC, the host. Huntsman really won. Ron
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:48.580]  Paul and his supporters are frauds.
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:52.960]  Yeah. I mean, you know, this is disgusting.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.100]  These guys think, you talk about the white shoe boy arrogance. They really are arrogant.
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:01.940]  They're so used to telling us to get down and lick their boots and get down and do what
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:06.860]  they say. They really think they control us. But you can see them losing. I mean, they're
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:09.260]  losing more and more every day, Gerald.
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:16.740]  Well, I know. Look, it's evident as can be. Who are these people to say what we should
[01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:20.860]  think or who can win? I mean, the arrogance is-
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:27.380]  They think we're so weak minded and so peer pressure driven that they tell us how to dress,
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:32.380]  how to talk, like your dad used to tell you. Don't be a parrot, don't repeat, be your own
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:37.460]  person. That's what freedom's all about. And when some guy's in a suit with a perfect teleprompter
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:42.300]  saying Ron Paul and his supporters are a fraud, no, that person's a fraud.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:46.700]  And he's a panicked fraud. And they're so arrogant. They're so hubris for old Gerald
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:52.940]  that I know is what's gonna undo them because they just can't even hide what arrogant scumbags
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:53.940]  they are.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:57:03.180]  Yeah, exactly. And again, the future is ours to have. You look at the number of young people
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:09.100]  that are supporting Ron Paul. And there was a thing, I can't stand the Huffington Post.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:14.160]  There was something in there yesterday about this woman writing about how the young people
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.820]  are supporting Ron Paul. In one illiterate sentence, one illiterate long sentence, she
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:27.460]  managed to knock him down three times, calling him crotchety, saying that he has to take
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:31.780]  a nap or he can't go on because he has to take a rest.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:39.060]  I mean, a great grandfather, one derogatory thing after another, and then finally saying
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:45.260]  that young people support him. So it's the youth that could get us through this.
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:49.540]  And I love the fact that Ron Paul points out win, lose or draw, we win. This is about an
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:53.140]  idea and those are bulletproof. Alaric, anything else?
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:58:00.180]  Yeah, Florida looks like they're gonna allow proportional delegates. So if that is true,
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:03.100]  then Ron Paul may stand a chance to get delegates from Florida.
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:09.680]  Yeah, it does. And again, you know, let's understand, as you just pointed out, the game
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:16.720]  is rigged. They rig it, whether it's finance, whether it's politics. Look at the reports
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.500]  that just came out about two months ago. I'll tell you what, Gerald, do five more
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.260]  with us and tell us about those reports. Take a call or two, we'll get you out of here in
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:26.900]  about six minutes. We're back in one minute. But people say, well, then why run if it's
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:32.860]  rigged? You show how it's rigged by running. OK, you get in the ring, you beat the other
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:37.540]  guy and they and they hold the other guy's hand up and show you that it's rigged. Now,
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:51.140]  you know, Don King's running the match. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:38.740]  Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, Gerald Cilenti, top
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:42.180]  trends forecaster. You got cut off by the break. You were starting to make a point.
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:47.020]  Well, the point is, is that the game is rigged now. Just a couple of months ago, there was
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:53.420]  a report that came out about the last elections in Ohio and how those numbers or election
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:58.740]  before, how the numbers are all cooked. And what do we have that company, Diebold, the
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:04.100]  Republican company that controls most of these, these voting machines and how easily they
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:11.580]  can be act, I think for like 24 bucks. So the game is rigged at every level. But the,
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:19.820]  as you keep pointing out, Alex, more and more people are aware now. The show is so bad.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:27.340]  The con men aren't that good anymore. Look at them. O'Donnell, Schultz, Motto, Hannity,
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:35.180]  Combs, Laurel, Hardy, Abbott, Costello. Give me a break. Who believes this stuff? One of
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:41.860]  my pals, Anthony Formanzano. I said to him, Anthony, I said, if Santorum or Romney or
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:48.940]  Gingrich or Huntsman came into our place over here and tried to lay their line on us, how
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.780]  long would they last before we threw them out?
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:02:00.180]  Anthony said, about 30 seconds. And then he said, maybe shorter. The only way these guys
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:07.540]  could get away with this crap is by having the presidential reality show stage set for
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:14.700]  them and a bunch of suck up, bow down, prostitutes making them look good.
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:20.340]  No, they force feed us like geese or something. They force feed us their vomit so they can
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:25.460]  eat our livers later. Let's talk to Tim and Georgia. Tim, you're on the air with Gerald
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:30.340]  Salente, last caller for Gerald. We'll get to everybody else from Bob Chapman. Go ahead,
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:31.340]  Tim.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:32.340]  Yes, sir, how you doing today?
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:33.340]  Good, welcome.
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:40.020]  Very well. Well, I came up with a name for the media. I came up with Babylonian, because
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:43.700]  that's all they do is babble.
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:47.260]  And they want to sell us on a slave ridden empire. I like Prestitude. I think it's one
[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:55.100]  of the best ones out there. Propaganda media, dinosaur media is a term I've coined. But
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.580]  again, some of them won't know what a Prestitude is, understanding it's a prostitute. Gerald,
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:07.500]  what are some other names for the suck up, mercenary, deceiver, Decepticon, liar media?
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:09.820]  I mean, just scam artists, hoax media?
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:15.340]  Yeah, I mean, these are people who have no self respect. They're the same people in high
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:20.260]  school and college that were head of the school newspaper. They were sucking up to the principal
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:25.220]  of the dean. They're doing the same thing now with the president of the school. And
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:31.620]  by the way, you have that great Anthony Frieda art of the Prestitude. And we'll send you
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:36.140]  a Prestitude T-shirt that he did. And it's really a brilliant one.
[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:38.780]  Can I buy a Prestitude T-shirt of trends research?
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:43.560]  Well, I'm going to send one to you that he made up for us. But you have that one from
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:49.080]  one of our past trends journals that he did. It's brilliant. And so all they are, these
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:54.720]  are people who have no self respect. All this is, everybody should understand this. As I
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:02.980]  read before earlier about the financial end and how these beltway circle jerk keeps congratulating
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:09.320]  themselves. It's high school. That's all it is. The people we hated in high school that
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.820]  wanted to be class president, head of the student council, there they are. Remember
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:19.520]  the guys that wanted to be the Eagle Scouts that went on to ROTC?
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.140]  You even hear him talk about Petraeus, who's now head of the CIA, about how he has that
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:30.460]  Boy Scout charm. These guys are still playing the same game. And then you've got the Hannity's.
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:38.820]  You've got the O'Reilly's and the Chris Matthews. These are the altar boys. That's all they
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:44.440]  are. I knew them. And I was the only kid in Christ the King's school that wasn't an altar
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:51.500]  boy because the guys like him. They love taking orders. And they like bowing down sometimes.
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:56.340]  All right, listen, great job, Gerald. God bless you. We'll talk to you soon. We'll be
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:05:02.340]  right back with Bob Chapman. Got a few movie clips I want to play. Andy, you may be arrested
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.040]  and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:10.840]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:15.780]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:21.220]  impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:27.320]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:32.300]  of government program has established an all powerful shadow state police state for chronicles
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:36.900]  the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:43.580]  world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:48.040]  and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish

[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:39.340]  glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:03.400]  Others don't. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:08.180]  solar powered generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:12.980]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:17.780]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:22.840]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:27.580]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:32.620]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:36.300]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related damages. Number
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:41.300]  five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:44.880]  I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:51.620]  my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:12.900]  Great brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:24.380]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:34.540]  Okay, this is going to be an absolutely jam packed third hour today with Bob Chapman
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:40.300]  of TheInternationalForecaster.com. If you're just joining us, I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:46.260]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 AM to 2 PM Central, 12 noon to 3 PM Eastern, obviously.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:54.760]  And I come back live Sundays and I'll be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 PM Central time as well.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:09:01.000]  Coming up, I want to go over the economic news that just confirms what Bob and others
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.420]  have broken down. They're now calling it the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression.
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:10.360]  And basically admitting it's a depression, but they won't call it that. And we've also
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.600]  got ex-Israeli intelligence officer tells the Jerusalem Post that the US will stage
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:20.340]  a Pearl Harbor attack against its own ships as a pretext for all out war.
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:23.900]  And I've got a bunch of economic news I want to go over as well with Bob like MF Global
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:28.700]  may not be able to pay clients back now. And the Drudge Report is linked to our cashless
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:34.900]  society. India implements first biometric ID program for all of its 1.2 billion residents.
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:42.680]  But coming up, I have a clip from Vendetta that I want to play, where they talk about
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:47.460]  government staging a false flag bio attack, which I believe is in the cards. And I've
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:50.460]  been saying this, of course, before that movie came out.
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:54.500]  I mean, it's very clear. You have the New York Times on Monday with a headline, Engineer
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:10:00.420]  Doomsday. We're all over the country, the US government funds in level two labs, what
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:09.040]  should be in level four labs, if anywhere, weaponized Ebola, bird flu, H1N1, mousepox.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:16.060]  Some of these kill 99% of all humans they come in contact with and are airborne.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:23.000]  So I want to play that clip coming up with Bob. But first, I wanted to play and then
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.940]  get Bob Chapman's take on this, because he grew up and saw all of this. The Andy Griffith
[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:37.540]  Show from the 1950s that aired into the 1960s, with all of its wholesome pro-America Constitution
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:40.040]  Bill of Rights messages.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:44.780]  And then compare this now, where everything is an assault on the family. Everything is
[02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:49.120]  how to teach your two-year-old profanity. The F word during the family hour uttered
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:55.340]  by the baby. I saw that this week. It's like baby to utter the F word on network TV. Just
[02:10:55.340 --> 02:11:00.820]  all about making everything petty and arrested development and adults acting like children.
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:06.060]  I mean, imagine if in 50 years TV has turned into what it is now, what will it be like
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:13.620]  in 20 years? Why is there this total assault on morality? Because if you stand for nothing,
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:14.620]  you'll fall for anything.
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:22.340]  That's why, so I wanna play this clip. Now, this is where the sheriff, his son's not doing
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:26.420]  well on some history. And he says, it's okay, Opie, I wasn't too good at history, don't
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:30.620]  worry about it. So he goes to the teacher and says, I'm not gonna worry about it. My
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:32.020]  dad says, don't worry about it.
[02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:36.220]  So she threatens to quit. The kids run into the police station. Now you have to go through
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:43.620]  a naked body scanner, cuz you're a terrorist. And they talk to the sheriff and say, gee,
[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:50.500]  this is great. She doesn't think she can teach us anymore, we're winning. And he gives them
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:56.180]  a little history lesson and tells them how informative and interesting history is.
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:00.380]  And they basically wake up to how amazing it is. So here's a few minutes of this clip.
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:06.700]  And then we'll get Bob Chapman's take on this on the other side. But this is from the episode
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:16.260]  of The Andy Griffin Show from the 1950s. This is one of the early ones titled Andy Griffith
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:38.860]  discovers America. Here it is.
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:45.240]  They might not be able to find you a new teacher. All the trouble you give Miss Crump. And if
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:48.380]  they do find one, I bet she won't give you any of that history homework.
[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:54.700]  I'm glad for you. You know that I'm glad for you. That history is hard. You're lucky. You
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:02.820]  know that. You know what y'all do? Go out and celebrate and have a good time. You won't
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:07.060]  have to study all that stuff and mess around learning all that dull stuff about about the
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:14.460]  Indians and red coats and cannons and guns and muskets and stuff.
[02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.860]  What about Indians and red coats and cannons and muskets and guns and stuff?
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:23.860]  Oh, you know, Indians and red coats and, you know, history.
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:24.860]  Yeah?
[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:29.340]  Yeah, they had the craziest gun.
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:30.340]  What gun?
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:36.580]  Oh, they had, they had a gun that fired a shot that was heard clear around the world.
[02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:53.940]  Darnedest thing I ever heard of, huh?
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:54.940]  What gun?
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:55.940]  What?
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:58.620]  What kind of gun?
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.620]  What kind of gun what?
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:02.740]  You know what kind of gun. The kind of gun that could fire a shot that could be heard
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:06.820]  clear around the world. Tell us about that gun.
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:13.740]  Well, there was this fella. You sure you want to hear this story's history?
[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:18.340]  Tell the story.
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:28.860]  Well, one time a long time ago, this country was a part of England and we wasn't getting
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:33.020]  along with them too good. In fact, we was thinking about breaking away and starting
[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:39.620]  our own country, but the king over there in England, he says, you do that and I'm going
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:45.500]  to send my red coats. They was British soldiers and he's going to send them over here to whup
[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:46.500]  us.
[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:49.500]  I'm over there.
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:54.700]  He says, you better think about that thing. Well, so your great great great great great
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:59.460]  great granddaddy's all got together, you know, to think about it. And they argued about it
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:03.540]  back and forth for a while. And finally one of them says, let's do it. Let's start our
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:07.780]  own country. Somebody says, how you do that? Says, I don't know. Says, I reckon you just
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:13.380]  start. Says, what do we call it? Says, let's call it, let's call it the United States of
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:14.380]  America.
[02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:15.380]  That was a good name.
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:21.900]  Yeah. Now, about that time up in Boston, Massachusetts, there's a fella living up there named Paul
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:25.980]  Revere and he's a pretty good old fella, just as poor as Job's turkey, but he's a pretty
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:30.940]  good old fella. And he owned a real good old horse named Nellie. Now, Paul, he was wandering
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:35.220]  around the streets up there one night and he come up on a friend of his and he says,
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:40.380]  Heidi, what's new? His friend says, what's new? Says, the British is coming. That's what's
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:44.900]  new. What's the matter with thee? And Paul says, you're kidding. He says, it's a fact.
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:48.340]  Says, I just heard it from an Indian and you know them Indians, they keep their ears to
[02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:53.140]  the ground. And Paul says, do the folks know about this? Fella says, I just heard about
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:57.520]  it myself. And Paul says, well, what we gonna do? And Fella says, I'm getting out of town.
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:01.100]  And Paul says, well, we got to spread the word. He says, you spread it. I'm getting
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:07.020]  out of town. Well, Paul, he didn't know what to do, but he knowed he had to do something.
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:12.700]  Now, it happened. It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:18.140]  here, that they had put a light up in this high church steeple. And Paul went down there
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:24.340]  to look. And sure enough, there was the light, burning brighter than day. Well, Paul, he
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:28.980]  jumped on his old horse and he lit out. He didn't know where he was going, but he knew
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:33.120]  he had to go somewhere. Oh, I wish you could have seen it. That old horse with his ears
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:38.100]  laid back in his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:43.020]  them cobblestones, striking off sparks. Paul holding on for dear life and hollering at
[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:47.420]  the top of his lungs. He says, the British is coming. The British is coming. Get you
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:52.740]  a gun, we're gonna have us a revolution. And them farmers come up piling out of the hay
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:58.980]  like bees out of beehive. Minutemen, they're called. They grab their squirrel guns. What's
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.380]  Minutemen? Minutemen, they're fellows that had to be ready at a minute's notice. And
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:07.820]  when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:14.260]  the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere. And when the British come prancing, all dressed
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:23.860]  up in their red suits and waving to the girls, they let them have it. It was a sight to see.
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:31.520]  And then it happened. They fired the gun. They fired the gun. And the shot was so loud,
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:42.860]  it was heard clear around the world. Oh, get out. That's the way this country started.
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:56.140]  You read the book? What book? Yeah, what book? Where'd you get that story, Paul? Paul, your
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:18:03.900]  history book. My history book? Sure. All kinds of good stories stuck in there amongst the
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:09.380]  history. Yeah? Good as the one you just told us? Sure. Some of them even better. No fooling,
[02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:13.620]  no fooling. You folks look through that book, I bet you in a couple of weeks you'd be coming
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:18.820]  in here telling me stories. All right, now, I wanted to play that, I appreciate Bob sitting
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:19.820]  while we did that.
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:23.060]  We're about to go to break, but I wanna get his take on it. To illustrate, you wonder
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:27.260]  why Americans don't know why they're being enslaved, they were never taught it. Look
[02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:35.980]  at the messages in TV now, it's all anti-liberty, anti-family, anti-gun. Look at what the globalists
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:42.500]  have done to us by design to steal our birthright. Bob Chapman, your take on that clip.
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:49.860]  And the opposite of that is training us to be citizens of the world in a one world government.
[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:58.740]  And as pointed out earlier by yourself, Alex, it's the difference between pro-Americanism
[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:06.060]  and morality. We're lacking a lot of that morality today as we know, we see what goes
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:12.380]  on every day. And so yes, there's been a process of brainwashing and they'll try to continue
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:13.380]  it.
[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:17.660]  And we have to inform people and that's what we're doing about what these people are up
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:20.140]  to and that's what these programs are all about.
[02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:25.100]  Bob, I'm glad you're here. I wanna get into the latest financial news and talk about what
[02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:28.340]  the new edition of the International Forecaster tomorrow is gonna cover at the International
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.840]  Forecaster.com. When we come back, I wanna first, cuz I heard a clip of you on another
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:36.340]  show doing this, but it didn't get into too much detail.
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:40.100]  Areas that you've studied that you think are better than the US outside the United States,
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:44.120]  cuz a lot of listeners ask me that. And I know you lived outside the United States for
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:50.700]  a very long time now because of globalists hunting Obi-Wan Kenobi around. And we'll get
[02:19:50.700 --> 02:20:06.060]  your take on that. On the other side, Bob Chapman's our guest. Stay with us. We'll be
[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:21.740]  right back.
[02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:43.660]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:21:07.740]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:12.060]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:16.860]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:20.740]  makes the same light as a real television. So from outside, it looks like someone is
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:25.680]  home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.960]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:35.260]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:43.500]  TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake TV is
[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:48.700]  only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:58.220]  of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. faketv.com. The burglar
[02:21:58.220 --> 02:21:59.220]  deterrent.

[02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:04.580]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in Fukushima,
[02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:09.580]  Japan, and making its way across the entire US continent, contaminating the air, water,
[02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:14.520]  and food? Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here. As a result, radiation
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:19.140]  poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the US unless you do something to
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:25.220]  protect yourself. How? With liquid zeolite from restoreyourhealthnow.com. Without a doubt,

[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:35.580]  Yeah, I'm right on the road from La Grange, or the ranch. Let's go ahead and go back to
[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:41.660]  Bob Chapman. Bob, as the United States continues to implode, obviously the same global system
[02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:45.780]  is unfolding everywhere, but from your research, I get these questions all the time, where
[02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:51.660]  are some of the better places to move to or expatriate to, in your opinion?
[02:24:51.660 --> 02:25:00.100]  Well, Europe's expensive, even by U.S. standards. The weather is poor most of the year. You
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:07.700]  might get one, two months of summer, and that's it. Canada's an opportunity. I do see people
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:15.420]  immigrating away from Australia, which really surprised me, but people immigrating into
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:22.260]  New Zealand. In South Central America and Mexico, there's been a tremendous amount of
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:27.940]  changes in the governments, particularly in South America. Most of them are communists,
[02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:32.620]  with the exception of Argentina, which is a fascist government, which now will only
[02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:39.460]  let you retire approximately two-thirds of your assets from the country. You'd have to
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:44.300]  leave one-third there, which is not a very good idea if you wanted to leave.
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:51.180]  What does that leave in South America? It leaves Chile, perhaps Colombia, which is very
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:58.220]  close to the United States. They work very closely with them, let's put it that way.
[02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:07.860]  Panama's not bad. Costa Rica's nice. Nicaragua's another communist country. Mexico, you do
[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:19.500]  along the Frontera, and in the south, and also in Culiacan, you have violence, and that's
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:24.140]  because of the war that's been going on for five years between the government and the
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:32.260]  Nacotar Avocates. It's a mixed bag. You've got to pick out a spot where you think you'd
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:39.540]  like to go that's relatively safe. Some countries will allow you to work, some won't. It all
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:50.700]  depends on your profession. That's basically it. The best ones are probably Canada, Australia,
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:57.900]  Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. But undoubtedly, Australia and New Zealand
[02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:03.860]  are part of the whole globalist echelon group, as I call them, and Canada. You're kind of
[02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:08.140]  jumping out of the fire into the frying pan. But I guess the United States is command-based
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:12.820]  central of the global Imperium's army, and it's where there's going to be a big political
[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:16.620]  fight between liberty lovers and the New World Order. But if you want to be where the fight's
[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:22.060]  going to be, both intellectually and perhaps physically, this is ground zero. Do you agree
[02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:28.580]  with that analysis? Absolutely. If you're young and healthy in particular,
[02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:33.100]  and you have a family, you're not going to be able to jump to another country and just
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:38.100]  go to work. I don't allow that. And so you're going to stay there and you're going to fight.
[02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:44.100]  And people like me who have been forced out of the country, as old as I am, I'll be back.
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:47.540]  That's right. I mean, they tried to plant hand grenades on you, everything, just went
[02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:54.900]  on for decades and you finally left. But how long have you been out of the US, Bob?
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:59.060]  This time, nine years. Of course, before that you lived all over the
[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:05.340]  world in business. Well, yeah, but I lived in so many countries
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:10.140]  I can't keep track of them all. And I lived there for a year or two or three. I mean,
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:16.740]  like in Africa, I was there for over three years. And Canada, I was there for a year.
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:24.960]  The Bahamas, I was there for a year. Uruguay, maybe two years, and so on and so forth.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:27.860]  How is Latin America- I can't speak to what it's like.
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:32.420]  Yeah. How has Latin America changed since you first visited?
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:41.820]  It's become more Americanized. And the standard of living has really been raised big throughout
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:46.820]  Latin America or Mexico. That's a good thing.
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:52.660]  They've come a long way. There's no giant reason for people to leave most of the countries
[02:28:52.660 --> 02:29:02.340]  in that region and go to America now because there are lots of jobs. Mexico City is booming.
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:09.020]  Some of the countries are doing very well. Venezuela, not so much though with the commie
[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:12.980]  running it. No, but that's what you have to expect when
[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:20.980]  you have communism. And you've got it in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, as I mentioned Nicaragua. Right
[02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:28.300]  on the edge is Brazil. They're not fooling anybody. And then you've got a fascist government
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:38.740]  in Argentina, which is loaded with crime. I saw a holdup at the airport.
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:42.140]  Hey there. I want to hear about this. And then I want to get into this next clip from
[02:29:42.140 --> 02:29:47.940]  the makers of the matrix from V for Vendetta dealing with government sponsored terror and
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:50.500]  a bunch of other financial news and some calls all jam packed.
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:58.100]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:06.860]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[02:30:06.860 --> 02:30:12.200]  opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Calvin Pierce soap company
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:16.540]  can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are
[02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:21.580]  triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable
[02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:27.900]  and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials. Your
[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:34.140]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating
[02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:38.020]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never
[02:30:38.020 --> 02:30:41.980]  had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:12.380]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:18.720]  from underneath Americans at home to tremendous influence on our president and Congress. And
[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:23.860]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:29.180]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:34.740]  criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes, constructing
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:39.300]  world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:43.220]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to today? Seems like nobody
[02:31:43.220 --> 02:31:49.740]  does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your

[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:38.700]  to Jeff, Tommy, Erica, Chris, Leo, at least before this hour ends. Bob Chapman is our
[02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:42.620]  guest and I got him diverted off into his world travels. I want to get into the economy
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:45.100]  and I ran with him before I get to this next clip in your calls.
[02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:50.220]  But Bob, you got interrupted by the end of that segment. You were saying you saw a stickup,
[02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:55.660]  repeat where you saw that and where you see the most outrageous crime. My dad was in Paraguay
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:34:00.980]  a few times a year. He goes to Latin America and places. Most dentists and doctors get
[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:05.620]  recruited for this and he goes and does clinics in the jungle and stuff with starving children.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:10.940]  He says it'll really make you appreciate life going where they tell you don't give a child
[02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:15.540]  a balloon or anything cuz other kids, people will kill them for it.
[02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:19.740]  The jealousy is so out of control, people dumping their kids everywhere. But he was
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:26.880]  out in Paraguay for about a week and a half and working most days, long hours doing free
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:33.500]  dental work and other things at clinics. And as part of a foundation that he went with,
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:36.420]  but then one day they said, well, take off this afternoon, we're gonna take you to a
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:38.420]  national soccer game.
[02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:41.220]  And my dad told me about this and I was at his house a month ago and I pulled it up on
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:46.220]  my iPhone, there it was. He just got back from Paraguay. They threw a stick of dynamite
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:51.020]  down at the referee and blew him and one other person up, almost killing both of them. My
[02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:53.620]  dad was like 60 feet from this happening.
[02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:58.380]  So talk about bedlam. I know my uncle was in Guatemala back in the 80s, living down
[02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:02.700]  there with a coffee plantation he had. And they talked about hand grenades being thrown
[02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:06.740]  at the market on a routine basis. So finish your story.
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:14.460]  Well, we were across the street about 60 feet away and this man walks up to a couple. And
[02:35:14.460 --> 02:35:20.180]  I see the man take his wallet out and hand it to the other guy. And the guy, I could
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:25.620]  see his gun. He stuck it in the gun back in his belt, buttoned his jacket and then just
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:26.620]  walked off.
[02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:30.980]  There were no police around. And inside the input, there were no police either. And the
[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:37.820]  only police I saw them when you go through them checking your baggage, that sort of thing.
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:45.020]  But there's streets there in Buenos Aires that you just can't go down during the daytime,
[02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:52.300]  nevermind at night. And that's if you're armed. I mean, if you're unarmed, your goose is cooked
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:58.380]  and you got to learn those things living there so that you don't happen to go down the wrong
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:35:59.380]  street.
[02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:03.980]  It's a prerequisite of all these nations. They've never had a Second Amendment. And
[02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:08.420]  so only the criminal government and the criminals are armed and it's a living hell.
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:15.260]  Well, it varies from state to state. You take Mexico as an example. You could go to the
[02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:22.780]  military, sign up and purchase a gun from them. And you can carry it with you. You can
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:28.080]  have it in your house. If you carry it with you, you can't have the bullets in the gun.
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:34.100]  So you buy an automatic. It has to be lower in caliber than or the same as what the military
[02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:42.340]  is carrying. And they carry a nine millimeter. And so you can use a.357 or something like
[02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:44.700]  that in an automatic.
[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:49.940]  From what I've read though, Mexico has almost a complete gun ban for the citizens. I know
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.540]  there are hoops you can jump through to get a gun and you basically get registered with
[02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:54.540]  them.
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:37:00.260]  But it's easy. It's not hoops, it's easy. All you have to do is go to the military and
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:06.660]  show them your voting card and your driver's license and who you are. And you can buy a
[02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:14.220]  shotgun and a rifle, but they can't be a caliber that's in excess of what military has.
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:19.020]  That must have changed recently then because of the bedlam. Because from what I've read
[02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:22.980]  just in fact book stuff is that they pretty much have no Second Amendment, but that's
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:24.620]  good news.
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:32.300]  Well, I just happen to know that because I know somebody who worked in the military and
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:36.740]  he was in the army and he handled that. That's how I know about it.
[02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:37.740]  Yeah, well there's this claim-
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:43.020]  But other nations like Costa Rica, you can have a gun. I mean, I've been in and I lived
[02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:52.540]  there for a long time. I went in the market downtown in San Jose and I'm just going through.
[02:37:52.540 --> 02:38:00.420]  It's like a Tiangis, which is a flea market. And there's one count and the other is four
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:04.980]  or five guns for sale. No registration, no nothing.
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:09.780]  Well, that's a big plus. I know a lot of those countries though do restrict the citizens
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:12.580]  having guns.
[02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:19.820]  That's right, because usually they're quasi-dictators and that's the mindset. I mean, even the legal
[02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:29.660]  elections, they have that same view on the people as they do in London and Washington.
[02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:33.540]  It varies by degree.
[02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:39.020]  Bob, I want to move now into the economy. MF Global may not be able to pay clients back,
[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:43.340]  but let's skip that because I already covered that with Gerald Cilente. What do you make
[02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:50.420]  of the credit ratings being dropped in other European countries, the latest economic numbers
[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:53.220]  we've got here in the United States?
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:39:03.220]  Well, we've been waiting for France to be lowered and that affects the EFSF, which is
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:08.340]  a funding mechanism. The ESM, which they're trying to get past, which is another funding
[02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:15.300]  mechanism, which will probably supersede the EFSF, but what they did is they had the Federal
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:24.260]  Reserve do a swap and the swap is a technical thing where we'll give you a trillion dollars
[02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:30.740]  worth of dollars and you give us a trillion dollars worth of euros. Everything goes down
[02:39:30.740 --> 02:39:35.780]  on a digital basis.
[02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:41.380]  The reason they did this, and they actually broke the law in the United States as well
[02:39:41.380 --> 02:39:47.580]  as in Europe, because they're not supposed to do that because it's a loan by any other
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:54.980]  name. With that said, in the fractional banking system, these 523 banks that took that money
[02:39:54.980 --> 02:40:03.240]  down, they can multiply that by nine or more if they choose. In essence, what the Fed did
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:08.540]  is not only give them a trillion dollars to play around with, they really gave them 10
[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:14.700]  trillion or more. That's going to affect the U.S. markets and the British markets as well,
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:21.380]  because there are those who still don't trust the system in Europe, which is the euro, and
[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:27.380]  they've already started buying U.S. treasuries because they deem them safer than the euro
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:33.500]  at this time. You're getting money moving from one place to the other. What does that
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:39.820]  mean to the United States? It means that the economy will probably grow more in the United
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:45.940]  States this year than anybody had anticipated. What are we talking about? I thought it would
[02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:51.220]  be minus one and a half percent in disaster. With this money being let loose, it's going
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:57.940]  to probably be a plus one and a half percent or 2%, and that is going to be very surprising
[02:40:57.940 --> 02:41:02.820]  to people because they didn't figure on this and they didn't know about it.
[02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:07.620]  I didn't know they were going to do that. They have a lot of curveballs they can throw,
[02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:12.020]  so let's think about curveballs. Obviously, they can launch a war with Iran for the election
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:18.660]  as an October surprise, Obama and all of his sheep-like followers, and they can also do
[02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:24.300]  some other hanky-panky economically to jumpstart things for a while. What else, Bob?
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:33.940]  Well, I think this business of the French being lowered is only one of two. They'll
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:43.220]  be lowered again this year. They did not lower any of the German banks, nor Ireland for that
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:53.380]  matter. That's why they came out with this money exchange at this time because they knew
[02:41:53.380 --> 02:42:00.340]  that Europe could not handle it, and they're never going to be able to handle it. In fact,
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:07.740]  Jamie Dimon yesterday, who is the head of JPMorgan Chase, said exactly the same thing
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:14.460]  I'm saying now, and he said they'll take care of him for a year, maybe a little longer.
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:17.140]  I've been saying the same thing for about three weeks.
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:20.540]  Yeah, so is this a form of a haircut for the banksters?
[02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:21.540]  What's that?
[02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:24.700]  I mean, how does this affect the banksters then?
[02:42:24.700 --> 02:42:26.460]  Oh, this is good for them.
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.460]  So it's not a haircut.
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:31.000]  They're going to make loans and make more money because they're buying money over in
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:37.020]  Europe paying 1%, and then if they deposited with the European Central Bank, they got a
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:38.020]  quarter of a percent.
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:43.300]  So who does it hurt then? Everybody who's on fixed incomes with the inflationary result?
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:48.260]  Yeah, absolutely. Not only over there, but the United States because a lot of that money
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:54.780]  is going to drift into the US market. See, these are things that most people don't think
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:43:00.100]  about. Jamie Dimon does because he runs a bank. Well, I think like the banker because
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:04.740]  I know where he's coming from, and that's the advantage of having the experience I've
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:09.780]  had in those markets, being able to tell what's important to these people and why they're
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:10.780]  doing what they're doing.
[02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:18.500]  Now, Bob, I want to talk about Iran here in a moment after we go to this short clip. But
[02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:23.060]  I want to discuss after Iran false flag events because the top Israeli intelligence officers
[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:28.760]  come out and said Pearl Harbor style attack will be pretext for war on Iran. Jerusalem
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:34.640]  Post article implies US will stage provocation, justify military assault because of the fact
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:41.100]  that we've exposed false flags, provocateur events, frame ups, self inflicted wounds,
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:42.740]  inside jobs.
[02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:51.780]  That's now entered the nomenclature out there. And so that damages the tool, but it's still
[02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:55.780]  such a good tool for governments. I want to get your take on whether or not they'll use
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:59.780]  it, but I just wanted to use an example from popular culture here. This is from the movie
[02:43:59.780 --> 02:44:09.020]  V for Vendetta, where the detectives who are outside of the internal security police are
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:13.660]  going to meet with a doctor who was at this prison camp where they were doing medical
[02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:19.420]  experiments to find out why everybody involved in it is being killed by the hero V.
[02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:24.420]  And of course, really, the doctor's been dead for a while anyways, it's V dressed up like
[02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:32.140]  the doctor. But here they are discussing a fictional false flag. The reason I use a fictional
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:36.740]  false flag to illustrate real false flags, a lot of people have walls built in their
[02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:43.420]  minds where they can't discuss a real false flag like Gulf of Tonka or 9-11 or Operation
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:46.540]  Ajax because there's too much emotion involved.
[02:44:46.540 --> 02:44:52.040]  But if it's in a movie, you can understand how the government stages an event to not
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:57.680]  just create fear, but also make money on the cure. And that's undoubtedly where all this
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:01.940]  is going with the New York Times article, Engineer Doomsday, with all these airborne
[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:07.620]  pathogens, bird flu, mousepox, swine flu that kill over 90% of those that come in contact
[02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:08.620]  with it.
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:12.200]  And the government's ordering this brewed up by the thousands of gallons all over the
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:17.960]  country. And it's not cuz they wanna play patty cake, folks. So let's go ahead and go
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:19.620]  to this clip, here it is.
[02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:26.660]  Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He's
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:32.340]  a deeply religious man and a member of the Conservative Party. He's completely single-minded
[02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:36.980]  and has no regard for the political process. The more power he attains, the more obvious
[02:45:36.980 --> 02:45:43.980]  his zealotry and the more aggressive his supporters become. Eventually, his party launches a special
[02:45:43.980 --> 02:45:49.060]  project in the name of national security. At first, it's believed to be a search for
[02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:55.060]  biological weapons and its pursuit without regard to its cost. However, the true goal
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:46:01.940]  of this project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however,
[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:08.540]  ends violently. But the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage
[02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:13.020]  war is born from the blood of one of the victims.
[02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:18.120]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:23.980]  alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
[02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:30.460]  It's at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without
[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:35.340]  a conscience, for whom the ends always justify the means, and it is he who suggests that
[02:46:35.340 --> 02:46:40.020]  their target should not be an enemy of the country, but rather the country itself. Three
[02:46:40.020 --> 02:46:44.100]  targets are chosen to maximise the effect of the attack, a school, a tube station and
[02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:49.300]  a water treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. But Three Waters
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:54.140]  has in fact been contaminated. Authorities are attempting to control its deadly spread.
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:58.860]  Such a wave of destruction throughout the underground. Fuelled by the media, fear and
[02:46:58.860 --> 02:47:04.100]  panic spread quickly, fracturing and dividing the country until at last the true goal comes
[02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:09.160]  into view. Before the St Mary's crises, no one would have predicted the results of the
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:16.440]  election that year, no one. And then not long after the election, lo and behold, a miracle.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:21.380]  Some believed it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:28.260]  by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich. A year later, several extremists
[02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:35.320]  are tried, found guilty and executed while a memorial is built to canonise their victims.
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:41.300]  But the end result, the true genius of the plan was the fear. The fear became the ultimate
[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:45.260]  tool of this government and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the
[02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:56.340]  newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.
[02:47:56.340 --> 02:48:01.480]  Now there it is from a movie, but Bob, what do you make of all these reports that we talked
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:05.900]  about a decade ago, but now are admitted, where they're producing, according to the
[02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:13.420]  Baltimore Sun, thousands of gallons at 36 facilities across the country of every airborne
[02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:17.700]  weaponized mega death weapon you could ever imagine.
[02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:29.420]  Ebola, mousepox, multiple flus, and then admitting it. And they're just sitting there on just,
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:35.000]  and obviously they're thinking about releasing it and blaming it on Al-Qaeda, or other affiliated
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.780]  imaginary mythical Easter Bunny groups. I mean, you can see what they're getting ready
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:41.460]  for, Bob.
[02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:50.440]  Well, it's total war, and that would take the population down considerably. And it would
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:58.820]  also put people in a position, even if they wanted to, because of their illnesses, even
[02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:06.020]  if they didn't die, to be able to challenge whatever authority was in place. And so I
[02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:10.260]  can see them doing such things as diabolical as they are.
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:15.100]  Yeah, well, listen folks, there's a very good chance, whether it's this year or 10 years
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:20.180]  from now, I've read all the eugenics documents, the globalist proof of what they're planning,
[02:49:20.180 --> 02:49:27.260]  all the preconditioning. I'm telling you that they're planning to do this, it's in the cards.
[02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:31.220]  When will they play the card? I don't know. But this is their big ace in the hole. And
[02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:35.460]  so just remember out there, some of you, if we don't turn this around now, when you lose
[02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:38.500]  your family or whatever, just remember who really did it.
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:45.700]  And remember, I warned you, the wages of not waking up is death. Bob Chapman.
[02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:51.780]  That is a cold, hard fact. And if we do not get Ron Paul in office, we can expect those
[02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:58.300]  kind of things are going to happen along with a lot of other terrible things. And so that's
[02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:04.820]  our job. This is the last shot of doing everything legally, because after that, everything is
[02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:11.980]  going to degenerate. Is it going to be war? Of course. When? I don't think anybody knows.
[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:23.660]  We see them playing games with their big ships now. And we've seen the banking system shut
[02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:30.780]  off to Iran. We've seen their clients who buy oil from them, being told that they can't
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:36.380]  use their oil. That's warfare. Yeah, I mean, it's on. I mean, it's on. And then we're still
[02:50:36.380 --> 02:50:39.780]  having a debate about whether a war has already started when they're admittedly blowing up
[02:50:39.780 --> 02:50:46.820]  bases inside Iran. Bob, that's right. And they have the temerity to blow up people in
[02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:52.140]  the middle of the city. Scientists who are working on the nuclear project just a couple
[02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:55.500]  of days off the charts and saying, stay there, Bob. We've got to come back with calls in
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:59.340]  the next two segments. We'll do five minutes of overdrive today. But I've studied the thing.
[02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:03.420]  Well, I'll tell you about when we get back. Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal
[02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:07.100]  or thyroid? Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:11.580]  both as a vapor and as particles into your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body,
[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:15.540]  it stops cells from functioning normally. Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney
[02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:20.740]  function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause the
[02:51:20.740 --> 02:51:25.220]  corresponding drop in function. The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself
[02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:29.740]  of mercury is glutathione. The number one superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion
[02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:34.700]  cells of your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass fed
[02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:39.940]  cows. After investigating most high end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most
[02:51:39.940 --> 02:51:45.340]  non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what
[02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:52.460]  nature originally put into the fresh raw whey. It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's

[02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:31.060]  Aaron in here a couple days ago reading the quotes that once the world government's in
[02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:38.420]  place, they're gonna release weaponized Ebola and mousepox and kill all of us. I mean, they've
[02:54:38.420 --> 02:54:40.960]  got underground bunkers everywhere, seed vaults.
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:46.860]  They're screwing up all the major seed lines with GMO. And they're producing all this weaponized
[02:54:46.860 --> 02:54:52.380]  garbage and having it in level two facilities everywhere. And it's not for defense. They
[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:56.900]  admit it's offensive while they parade around trying to shoot us up with deadly vaccines
[02:54:56.900 --> 02:54:59.140]  with RDF soft kills in them.
[02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:02.820]  But they're moving out of the just giving us cancer and everything. They're moving into
[02:55:02.820 --> 02:55:08.560]  just selling everybody. I mean, with mousepox, you're talking about 99% kill rate. Airborne
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:16.820]  Ebola, 94, 95. This H1N1 garbage, you're weaponized. Bird flu, 91, 92. I mean, you're
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:22.900]  talking about nine out of ten people on your street dead. And you're talking about psycho
[02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:25.660]  killers who'll do it.
[02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:30.020]  They wanna move into a new system. And the whole time they're killing everybody, they're
[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:34.660]  gonna be on TV posing as the saviors. And of course, then they'll roll out with the
[02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:37.980]  little minions and give them the vaccines that actually cure them. All the rest of us
[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:42.600]  will just get death. And even those that do get the other shot is gonna have a sterilant
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:43.600]  in it.
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:48.100]  Matt Chapman, do you think this is a nightmare vision I'm putting out? Or from your research,
[02:55:48.100 --> 02:55:51.860]  is it accurate as one of the cards in their fist?
[02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:58.320]  It's certainly accurate. And these plans go back to during World War II and then afterward
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:04.900]  and what they found out from their allies as well as enemies of these kinds of things
[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:14.300]  to deal with people. This has been an ongoing thing. It's just, it's diabolical. When I
[02:56:14.300 --> 02:56:18.020]  was involved, I never got involved in anything like that.
[02:56:18.020 --> 02:56:24.540]  So I only learned what I learned recently in the last 20 years, so to speak.
[02:56:24.540 --> 02:56:27.500]  Yeah, you mean when you were in intelligence. Let's jam in a few.
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:28.900]  I was in a different area.
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:35.380]  Let's go to Jeff in North Carolina. You're on the air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead.
[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:38.820]  It all seems like a North Carolina day. I know you're gonna close out the show here.
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:43.420]  I'll try to go quick and get your opinion on a couple of things. Again, thanks guys.
[02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:45.060]  And thanks for everything you're doing.
[02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:46.060]  Thank you.
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:47.060]  Thank you.
[02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:50.940]  I know, I just want to real quick, I've been in the media for quite some time and I've
[02:56:50.940 --> 02:56:55.460]  been doing quite a bit, as much as I can, given the resources and time I have as well
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:56:59.620]  to combat the delusions descending upon humanity.
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:04.500]  But real quick, on the Andy Griffith show, there was an episode years ago where there's,
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:08.140]  I think the president was coming through Mayberry. I distinctly remember that the shot of a guy
[02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:12.780]  standing on the sidewalk in downtown Mayberry kind of protesting. And he told them a big
[02:57:12.780 --> 02:57:17.300]  sign and it either says down with the gold standard or no to the gold standard.
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:20.460]  So I just thought I'd bring that point up real quick.
[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:23.900]  So a little propaganda against gold. No, no, no. Undoubtedly there was some in there as
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:27.660]  well. Talking to one of my guys who shows it to his kids and he says, yeah, it's one
[02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:31.140]  of the better shows, but it's got propaganda in it as well. Do you have any questions or
[02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:32.620]  comments for myself or Bob?
[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:40.260]  Yeah, I wanted to ask you gentlemen both, if you ever heard of the capstone concept
[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:43.020]  for joint operations.
[02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:47.660]  The capstone concept, I mean, is that unified command?
[02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:54.340]  Yeah, it's a COG and basically it's a government document you can find on the internet and
[02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:58.620]  it's capstone as in the capstone over the pyramid on the back of the dollar. But it's
[02:57:58.620 --> 02:58:03.500]  the plan of how they're going to use, they're going to subvert the American people and trick
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:07.060]  them into accepting militarization of the streets of America.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:11.580]  No, I haven't seen that. What do I Google? Capstone COG?
[02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:15.380]  Just capstone concept for joint operations and you'll find it.
[02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:22.100]  Capstone concept for joint operations. Capstone concept for joint operations. We'll look into
[02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:26.220]  that. Thank you so much. We're gonna get Bob's brief take on that. The main show's over but
[02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:30.540]  we're audio stream and video stream at info.wars.com and prisonflight.tv. We're gonna come back
[02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:32.660]  for five more minutes, get Bob's take on that.
[02:58:32.660 --> 02:58:38.060]  Take a call or two from folks that have been holding the longest, Erica and others. We'll
[02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:39.780]  be right back. Stay with us.

[02:59:52.460 --> 02:59:59.980]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:15.340]  Okay, final segment, little addendum of overdrive here. I'm trying to get to your calls. Bob
[03:00:15.340 --> 03:00:20.980]  had so many great points on all those clips. Erica in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[03:00:20.980 --> 03:00:21.980]  Hello?
[03:00:21.980 --> 03:00:22.980]  Hi.
[03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:31.700]  Hi, Alex. I wanted to ask you about, you'd mentioned something about prescriptions and
[03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:38.540]  shots. I got a call from the Center of Disease Control and they sent me all this stuff in
[03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:43.340]  the mail. They want to know if my child's up to date on shots.
[03:00:43.340 --> 03:00:47.540]  Yeah, there's massive harassment by the feds of just everybody trying to force hundreds
[03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:51.500]  of new shots on people. And you go to the grocery store, there's signs everywhere. You
[03:00:51.500 --> 03:00:56.780]  go to the drugstore, they're in your face pushing it on you. Because people are waking
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:01:01.460]  up statistically to the vaccine, so now they're upping the propaganda. Bob, you want to comment
[03:01:01.460 --> 03:01:02.460]  on this?
[03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:07.220]  Yeah, I understand that some of the stores are giving discounts if you'll take shots.
[03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:10.180]  Yeah, yeah, that's because they care about you, Bob.
[03:01:10.180 --> 03:01:18.460]  Yeah, they really do. They'd love to give me some shots, probably 45. But yeah, the
[03:01:18.460 --> 03:01:23.220]  people are waking up to it, there's absolutely no question. And having to shove it down people's
[03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:32.700]  throats, and that's what this young lady has received here, is really unusual. There's
[03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:34.740]  a great deal of work and cost that goes into it.
[03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:38.860]  Well, I did see it about a couple months ago, actually. It is new news, but in fact, guys
[03:01:38.860 --> 03:01:42.960]  type it in real fast. Centers for Disease Control now is going to people's houses, not
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:48.060]  just sending a mail. And then they're funding locals to do it as well, and like demanding
[03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:49.060]  you take shots.
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:51.340]  A few months ago, I played a news clip where they come to the door and they say, we're
[03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:55.860]  here to shoot your daughter up. And the lady tells them where they can go. But man, they're
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:02:00.540]  just trying to trick you into filling that out. I would put that in the circular, or
[03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:05.740]  you could scan it in and email it to tips at infowars.com, and we'll do an article on
[03:02:05.740 --> 03:02:06.740]  it.
[03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:09.740]  I mean, it's already out there, but it's always good to see the document.
[03:02:09.740 --> 03:02:14.620]  I told them that, I just lied and told them I didn't have any children here, because I
[03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:18.180]  refuse to give my children shots if they don't need them.
[03:02:18.180 --> 03:02:21.300]  All right, ma'am, I'm not gonna tell you what to do. I'm not gonna say you're wrong, but
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:26.060]  it's best to never lie. You don't have to answer government questions. And it's just
[03:02:26.060 --> 03:02:33.340]  best to never even, in fact, you never filled anything out, nothing ever even happened.
[03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:36.380]  I would not fill anything out of these miscreant scum, okay?
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:42.100]  Just wanna make sure your daughter gets cancer or your son gets cancer. And they use taxpayer
[03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:46.860]  money to pay for it. I mean, look, I've had censors at my door saying, you'll tell me
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:52.020]  about your stocks and bonds and your toilet. I got the long form and I said, you will get
[03:02:52.020 --> 03:02:56.180]  off my front porch, or I'm going to remove you.
[03:02:56.180 --> 03:03:00.340]  And they said, well, this is against the law. And I said, no, it's not scumbag. It's called
[03:03:00.340 --> 03:03:04.940]  the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, now get off my porch. They're trying to peck at us until
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:08.700]  we submit, hey, we're gonna stick our hands down your pants at the airport. Hey, you're
[03:03:08.700 --> 03:03:12.700]  gonna fill out all these forms for us. No, they're a bunch of trash. You see what I'm
[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:13.700]  saying, ma'am?
[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:14.700]  Yes, I do.
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:19.540]  I appreciate your call. Yeah, yeah, yeah, back it up right here, back it up. They actually
[03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:24.180]  found the clip, turn the audio up. They found it, here it is from the infowars.com article
[03:03:24.180 --> 03:03:27.460]  with the video from the local news in California, here it is.
[03:03:27.460 --> 03:03:32.540]  Bring the Tdap vaccine to meet a new state mandate. News sends Natalie Senz tagged along
[03:03:32.540 --> 03:03:33.540]  and has our story.
[03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:39.100]  Hello, how are you, ma'am? My name's Haman Matlock with the Thomas Unified School District.
[03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:43.300]  It's not easy going door to door making sure students are vaccinated.
[03:03:43.300 --> 03:03:45.900]  Your daughter is on independent study?
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:46.900]  Yes.
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:49.100]  Kayla, has she been verified with her Tdap?
[03:03:49.100 --> 03:03:50.100]  No.
[03:03:50.100 --> 03:03:54.140]  Okay, we were coming today to give her a Tdap if she hasn't had it done yet.
[03:03:54.140 --> 03:03:56.140]  Get the **** off my house.
[03:03:56.140 --> 03:04:01.020]  Now look, that's everything. That's total color of law saying it's a mandate, which
[03:04:01.020 --> 03:04:06.020]  isn't a law. It's like we're control freaks, we say so. But now they passed a law where
[03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:15.300]  they give your child the shot without even telling you at home. California is a Soviet
[03:04:15.300 --> 03:04:21.860]  empire, Nazi loving, scumbag, criminal, destroyed area.
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:24.140]  But Bob Chapman, final comments on that.
[03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:31.140]  You spent 36 years there and I escaped in 1994. And you're absolutely correct.
[03:04:31.140 --> 03:04:35.580]  But I mean, Bob, it's total color of law. They just show up and say we're gonna give
[03:04:35.580 --> 03:04:45.500]  her a shot and try to go in the house. There's no law, it's just it's pure con artist. Bob
[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:47.380]  Chapman, Lord Whittle, we'll see you back.
[03:04:47.380 --> 03:04:49.620]  They don't love us anymore, that's for sure.
[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:54.020]  Oh, they care about us, Bob. Bob, it was great having you on with us and we'll talk to you
[03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:55.020]  again soon, my friend.
[03:04:55.020 --> 03:04:56.020]  Gotcha, bye bye.
[03:04:56.020 --> 03:05:25.980]  See you next Friday. All right, see you back this Sunday, listeners four to six.
