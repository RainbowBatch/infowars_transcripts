[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:27.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  Today is Thursday, the 16th day of December, 2010.
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  We've got the radio broadcast jam-packed with Gas Tomorrow.
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  We're only going to get one guest on towards the end of the broadcast today, but I'll announce that later.
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.000]  We're going to have open phones today, and I will take your questions, your comments, any news items that you want to raise.
[00:53.000 --> 01:01.000]  We're going to have open phones throughout the full three hours, interspersed with a lot of really important news.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  But any subject you want to raise, any point you want to make, I want to hear from you.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  I'm going to attempt to try to move quickly through your calls, but also I need your calls to be brief and focused.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  And I need to be brief and focused as well, if we're going to get to a lot of your phone calls.
[01:17.000 --> 01:28.000]  But I love the different issues and points and angles that listeners bring up when we take an open line day of phone calls.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  Well, I have a lot of interesting news here in front of me.
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  Remember, I've been predicting false flag stage terror attacks ahead of the election and then intensifying from there on out.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  The government likes to go out and find mindless patsies that they try to provocateur with fake bombs into attacking.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  That way, they don't have to stage the events and then get caught.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  But they love to make you focus on Homeland Security as the center of the family, as the center of the culture,
[02:10.000 --> 02:20.000]  as basically a little baby Jesus in the crush there with Mary and Joseph and the three wise men.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  Just like at Walmart, when you're checking out, they're at the market.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  They have big droning, well, now 9,000 different stores, not just the 800-plus Walmarts are announcing.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  There will be 20,000 and 50,000 and just everywhere. Government droning giving you orders, it's the boss, it's the master.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  They make the sun shine, they make the grass grow.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  So they want to make sure during the Christmas holiday that you learn to worship naked body scanners,
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  you learn to worship black uniforms, you learn to worship threat fusion centers that spy on you,
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  you learn to worship the foreign banks raping you, or the dangerous scary men with turbines will get you.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  And they're hiding under every desk, in every closet, under every bed, in every cupboard, in every attic, in every basement,
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  in every culvert out in the park that kids are scared of.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  There's not trolls now in there, there's Alciaytas and they're going to get you.
[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  Got a better chance again of dying from being struck by lightning or when you're swimming or from a bee sting,
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  but doesn't matter, it's scary.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  Doesn't matter if 5 to 12, depends on the year, between 5 and 12 people die from shark attacks,
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  everybody's scared when they're swimming in the ocean.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  It's the same thing, it's not real, it's not rational, but oh my gosh, I mean, these men are wearing turbines.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  This is scary. We've got to get rid of our free country.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  We've got to let the banks rob us because they want to help us.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  Or Al Qaeda will get us. I mean, it's that simple and here they are.
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  Iraq, Al Qaeda planning holiday attacks in the west. That's the headline here out of CBS News.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Be afraid, be very afraid. I know I certainly am.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  I'm just glad Goldman Sachs is stealing all the money. That'll save us.
[04:03.000 --> 04:14.000]  Here's a mail online, Christmas Chaos Al Qaeda is planning suicide attacks across Europe and the U.S. war insurgents.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  And don't worry though, YouTube allows users to flag content as terror promotion.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  So now somebody can go say your video is violent or not appropriate.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  It could be two adults videotaping themselves playing Candyland or Tiddlywinks.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  And if someone says it's frightening to them, it's taken off YouTube, it's frightening.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  Well now, if someone says it's promoting terror, it's gone.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  So this is the new communist America, the new Soviet, where your neighbor has said that you are evil.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  The East German Stasi will not take you away.
[04:52.000 --> 05:01.000]  And collective punishment, when Al Cida blows something up, we all have to have the government put their hands down our pants. It's all coming up.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[05:25.000 --> 05:35.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[05:59.000 --> 06:06.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:06.000 --> 06:15.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[06:19.000 --> 06:26.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  That's endofamerica, the number 3.com.
[07:54.000 --> 07:59.000]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[07:59.000 --> 08:24.800]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:24.800 --> 08:28.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have wide open phones today and then in the last
[08:28.640 --> 08:34.720]  30 minutes of the third hour, we're going to have a guest on from a local activist group
[08:34.720 --> 08:40.440]  that has gone to the city council, gone to the different boards and got the council subgroups
[08:40.440 --> 08:50.160]  to vote and say that Austin doesn't want naked body scanners in the airport.
[08:50.160 --> 08:51.160]  And that's a tag.
[08:51.160 --> 09:00.960]  We have this happening in Florida, Colorado and a whole bunch of other states.
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.200]  Major towns and cities have had their district attorneys, their accounting attorneys come
[09:06.200 --> 09:13.520]  out and say, if you stick your hands down people's pants, you're going to go to prison.
[09:13.520 --> 09:17.060]  Hands down the pants is a felony and they do do that.
[09:17.060 --> 09:20.240]  Hands through the pants squeezing, that is a misdemeanor.
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.840]  And we've had some of those county and city attorneys on.
[09:24.840 --> 09:29.640]  And here's the big news, and I'm going to cover this again coming up in the third hour.
[09:29.640 --> 09:37.680]  The big news here is that Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew flew back from interviewing Charlotte
[09:37.680 --> 09:42.640]  Isherby, and by the way, she showed them secret skull and bones books of her father
[09:42.640 --> 09:43.640]  and grandfather.
[09:43.640 --> 09:46.760]  This is the stuff Anthony Sutton used, his secret source.
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.920]  They actually went up there and got to get a look at it and videotape it, and that's
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.520]  going to be up on PrisonPlanet.tv first of the year with a special report, probably two
[09:55.520 --> 09:56.520]  hours long.
[09:56.520 --> 10:01.280]  Oh yeah, Charlotte Isherby just wasn't the head of policy department of education.
[10:01.280 --> 10:05.160]  She's the person that blew skull and bones wide open more than 20 years ago.
[10:05.160 --> 10:13.760]  But continuing with this information, I'm already digressing, they flew back through
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.360]  Boston Logan, which has always been the test airport, the most draconian, I mean they had
[10:19.360 --> 10:21.440]  naked body scanners in there years ago.
[10:21.440 --> 10:26.640]  They had passive MRI brain scanners that I saw eight years ago being tested.
[10:26.640 --> 10:28.640]  It's the main beta testing center.
[10:28.640 --> 10:33.160]  Other airports are to a certain extent like LAX, JFK, and others, but this is the one
[10:33.160 --> 10:37.960]  where they really, really have been putting the screws in since day one.
[10:37.960 --> 10:41.280]  And Aaron and them flew through, they weren't using the body scanners.
[10:41.280 --> 10:44.600]  This was just on Wednesday they flew back.
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.520]  They interviewed her on Tuesday, or on Monday, excuse me, but they flew back Tuesday.
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.760]  The point is, they just flew back earlier this week, and they were not doing pat downs,
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.360]  they were not using body scanners, and we're getting more and more reports that they're
[10:59.360 --> 11:03.720]  not using them at most airports, and they're not sticking hands down pants, they're not
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.560]  ripping colostomy bags off the sides of people, they're not making women take out their artificial
[11:08.560 --> 11:13.260]  breast if they've lost their breast through mastectomies from breast cancer or other injuries
[11:13.260 --> 11:14.760]  or problems.
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.600]  They've really backed off because, A, they know that this is causing a general revolt,
[11:20.600 --> 11:26.960]  but B, and probably more important, all over the country, city councils, state legislatures,
[11:26.960 --> 11:32.120]  county attorneys, city attorneys, state police are saying, we're going to arrest you.
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.640]  You're not above the law, a sworn peace officer can't stick their hands down somebody's pants
[11:36.640 --> 11:44.400]  unless it's an emergency, or unless it is a warrants situation.
[11:44.400 --> 11:48.120]  And they go on and say, don't give us this garbage that you've bought your ticket so
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.240]  you've agreed.
[11:49.240 --> 11:53.200]  You can't buy a ticket and go to a topless bar and have one of the topless dancers
[11:53.200 --> 11:56.600]  stick their hand down your pants just because it's consensual.
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.080]  What you're doing is illegal, don't do it anymore.
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.600]  You can't treat everyone as if they're guilty until proven innocent to keep you safe from
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.120]  the boogeyman.
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.880]  You can't kill a free society and destroy everyone's rights in the name of safety.
[12:12.880 --> 12:14.040]  It doesn't work.
[12:14.040 --> 12:15.040]  It's a fraud.
[12:15.040 --> 12:16.540]  And it won't keep you safe.
[12:16.540 --> 12:21.240]  As Benjamin Franklin said, those that will give up liberty for so-called security will
[12:21.240 --> 12:22.240]  get none of it.
[12:22.240 --> 12:24.440]  In fact, there's several variants of the quote.
[12:24.440 --> 12:32.320]  He said, those that give up liberty for security will get neither liberty or security.
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.120]  And then he had a longer quote where he said, and they don't deserve it, but you can pull
[12:35.120 --> 12:36.120]  up those famous quotes.
[12:36.120 --> 12:38.240]  We'd like to see them in their full context.
[12:38.240 --> 12:44.080]  But that's common sense that we're dealing with here.
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.840]  And so it's very exciting to see this happening ahead of having our guest on.
[12:47.840 --> 12:56.560]  I want to play the local news piece to analyze it and critique it because the local news
[12:56.560 --> 13:06.760]  shows the city regulation board that did vote 5-0 against the naked body scanners, but then
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.120]  the news says, well, that's only ceremonial because the TSA makes the final decision.
[13:12.120 --> 13:22.040]  The TSA put into place after 9-11, the TSA gropers that were put into place by the transportation
[13:22.040 --> 13:28.840]  arm of Homeland Security, that agency was previously there, but they started the basic
[13:28.840 --> 13:31.680]  airport takeover at that point.
[13:31.680 --> 13:32.680]  That's all voluntary.
[13:32.680 --> 13:35.120]  The airports don't have to have them there.
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.920]  And it's the city of Austin that paid for the bonds for that stinking international
[13:40.920 --> 13:41.920]  airport.
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.360]  I paid for it.
[13:43.360 --> 13:47.440]  And so we elect our city council.
[13:47.440 --> 13:48.600]  And this is our town.
[13:48.600 --> 13:50.080]  This is not run by the feds.
[13:50.080 --> 13:56.840]  This is a tent amendment issue that goes right down to the city, the county, the state.
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.080]  The federal government is now saying they want to have TSA and they're beta testing
[14:01.080 --> 14:07.600]  it on every major highway, on street corners, at bus stations, at train stations, at malls.
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.120]  They're already putting TSA-controlled announcements through Homeland Security in, first it was
[14:13.120 --> 14:17.640]  800 plus Walmarts, now it's 9,000 retail centers.
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.040]  In the space of two weeks, it's gone from 800 plus to 9,000 plus in Homeland Security
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.360]  press releases.
[14:24.360 --> 14:27.320]  Just tell us screens everywhere saying, watch your neighbor.
[14:27.320 --> 14:29.840]  This isn't freedom, okay?
[14:29.840 --> 14:32.200]  I mean, I mean, it's just common sense.
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.760]  I know you know that, but the exciting news is all over the country, from Austin, Texas
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.920]  to Orlando, Florida, people are saying no.
[14:42.920 --> 14:48.760]  And I was watching this YouTube video, it's up on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[14:48.760 --> 14:54.800]  Paul Watson's written article about it, but he actually posted the local news station's
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.280]  video of the report.
[14:58.280 --> 15:02.920]  Austin joins rebellion against naked body scanners.
[15:02.920 --> 15:09.720]  And KXAN news report, you can get all the details there.
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.160]  But the point is, we can take back our cities.
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.800]  We can say no to sodium fluoride being added, along with radium and uranium.
[15:17.800 --> 15:18.800]  That's added too.
[15:18.800 --> 15:20.000]  You didn't know that?
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.200]  That's now confirmed and admitted.
[15:22.200 --> 15:29.080]  Along with lead and mercury and arsenic, oh yes, that's the toxic waste that comes out
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.960]  of the aluminum purification and smelting.
[15:33.960 --> 15:39.400]  It's the byproduct, also the power plant scrubbers, where they basically shoot a stream
[15:39.400 --> 15:47.560]  of water up in the smokestacks across the furnace, release valve, where all that cold
[15:47.560 --> 15:53.840]  smoke filled with mercury and lead and arsenic and uranium and plutonium, because that's
[15:53.840 --> 15:57.480]  where they mine it, is out of coal deposits and limestone deposits.
[15:57.480 --> 16:04.440]  So it's in there naturally, and so it purifies out in this water or condenses out, and then
[16:04.440 --> 16:07.480]  they sell that as something good for your teeth.
[16:07.480 --> 16:09.100]  They call it fluoride.
[16:09.100 --> 16:15.920]  It's a beautiful system, but I'm, again, already digressing here today.
[16:15.920 --> 16:18.480]  We can say no to all of this.
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.280]  City councils will laugh at first when you go up and say, here's CBS News out of Houston.
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.960]  They say they don't know why there's uranium and radium in the drinking water all over
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.440]  Texas, but it's confirmed that the state covered it up for decades with the feds.
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.120]  Here's the CBS News article.
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.360]  Now let me read to you, and then they can read from the public documents and admissions
[16:39.360 --> 16:42.880]  of what the, quote, EPA allows to be put in your water.
[16:42.880 --> 16:47.360]  The over 300 chemicals, again, it depends what company they're buying it from.
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.760]  It's always over 150 or so, sometimes over 300, but it's over 300 allowed, and you can
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.800]  just read that as we've done many times on air.
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.060]  To the city council, give them exhibits and say, you're on notice that poison is being
[16:58.060 --> 17:04.200]  put in the water, uranium, radium, lead, arsenic, mercury, sodium, fluoride.
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.520]  You can laugh and say fluoride's good for it because you've been brainwashed, that it
[17:07.520 --> 17:10.800]  is, but all these other things are admittedly poisonous and bad.
[17:10.800 --> 17:15.480]  You're on notice, I'm going to sue the city in one month if you don't read these documents
[17:15.480 --> 17:18.400]  and if you don't do a review and respond.
[17:18.400 --> 17:23.480]  And then they respond in a month and say, okay, there is no uranium in the water, which
[17:23.480 --> 17:27.480]  we know is a lie, or we believe mercury's good for you, or we believe arsenic's good
[17:27.480 --> 17:28.480]  for you.
[17:28.480 --> 17:29.480]  Then you have them in court.
[17:29.480 --> 17:33.160]  I mean, look, I can't do all this, but I'm giving you the battle plan.
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.680]  For 15 years, I've screamed and yelled about suing over them, taking your baby's blood
[17:37.680 --> 17:43.080]  at birth and giving it to the Pentagon for a secret bioweapon slash Rockefeller Foundation
[17:43.080 --> 17:44.920]  genetic engineering program.
[17:44.920 --> 17:51.160]  Finally, my listeners in Minnesota, in Austin, Texas as well, sued, they've won, it's proven
[17:51.160 --> 17:52.160]  it all.
[17:52.160 --> 17:53.160]  Now there's more suits.
[17:53.160 --> 17:55.160]  See, I can't do it all.
[17:55.160 --> 17:59.120]  I'm here telling you what's going on, laying it out, okay?
[17:59.120 --> 18:00.120]  I'm telling you the truth.
[18:00.120 --> 18:04.040]  I know if you're a new listener and it sounds crazy that the government's putting uranium
[18:04.040 --> 18:08.520]  and radium and lead and arsenic and everything else you can imagine in the water, and you
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.800]  can't believe it if you'll just go and get a tour of your water treatment facility, 71
[18:13.800 --> 18:17.600]  percent of cities and municipalities have it, and you get a full list and are allowed
[18:17.600 --> 18:24.720]  to get a sheet of what is on the bag, it will tell you, okay?
[18:24.720 --> 18:30.400]  So simple, just like I told you last year, do not believe me that the H1N1 shot can give
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.440]  you Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, or epilepsy.
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.360]  Do not believe me that it can cause brain damage or cancer or infertility.
[18:39.360 --> 18:47.160]  Read the insert, read the insert, read the insert, read the insert.
[18:47.160 --> 18:49.440]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.080]  Don't read the fake fact sheets they sent home with your kids from school about how it's
[18:53.080 --> 18:54.240]  totally safe.
[18:54.240 --> 18:58.000]  No problems, do you agree for them to have the shot?
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.920]  That's a lie, a criminal lie playing on our ignorance, not their fake fact sheet.
[19:03.920 --> 19:11.880]  Go to Walgreens and ask them for the drug insert that came in the ampule of the shot itself,
[19:11.880 --> 19:19.440]  the actual drug sheet, not a fake fact sheet, not a bologna sheet.
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.600]  Same thing on what's in your water.
[19:20.600 --> 19:24.240]  I'm going to say it again to all the yuppies that are in the days and under mind control,
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.280]  and have a psychological trigger compulsion to laugh when they hear something serious.
[19:29.280 --> 19:32.480]  There is poison in your water.
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.600]  There is poison in your water.
[19:36.600 --> 19:40.960]  The naked body scanners, literally hundreds of top scientists, radiologists on record,
[19:40.960 --> 19:46.920]  LA Times, New York Times, on and on and on, associated press admitting massive cancer
[19:46.920 --> 19:49.200]  risk from the body scanners.
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.560]  Do not say you weren't warned, but quite frankly the naked body scanners from my research are
[19:53.560 --> 19:55.840]  nothing compared to what you're drinking in the drinking water.
[19:55.840 --> 19:59.160]  You want to know why everybody's so unhealthy no matter how much they work out or eat right?
[19:59.160 --> 20:01.080]  The water's a chemical weapon.
[20:01.080 --> 20:05.360]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[20:05.360 --> 20:09.760]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA from exotic
[20:09.760 --> 20:15.400]  braids for military, rescue, arborist, shipyards, tow line or boating.
[20:15.400 --> 20:18.920]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.

[20:27.360 --> 20:30.480]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[20:30.480 --> 20:32.040]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[20:32.040 --> 20:35.720]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[20:35.720 --> 20:36.720]  IRAs?
[20:36.720 --> 20:40.840]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[20:40.840 --> 20:42.520]  of gold for your retirement.
[20:42.520 --> 20:46.000]  Gold is outperform paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.960]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[20:50.960 --> 20:56.840]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[20:56.840 --> 21:00.680]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[21:00.680 --> 21:06.240]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[21:06.240 --> 21:08.960]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[21:08.960 --> 21:11.240]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[21:11.240 --> 21:15.360]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[21:15.360 --> 21:16.960]  your health and your own family.
[21:16.960 --> 21:19.880]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[21:19.880 --> 21:22.240]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.680]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall
[21:26.680 --> 21:28.480]  owner General Growth Properties.
[21:28.480 --> 21:31.840]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[21:31.840 --> 21:35.960]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[21:35.960 --> 21:39.160]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[21:39.160 --> 21:40.680]  I can't stress this enough.
[21:40.680 --> 21:43.360]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[21:43.360 --> 21:47.600]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[21:47.600 --> 21:52.160]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[21:52.160 --> 21:54.840]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[21:54.840 --> 21:58.520]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[21:58.520 --> 22:24.000]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm warning of Greek-style U.S. debt
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  crises.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.640]  The CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S. economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[22:29.640 --> 22:34.680]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[22:34.680 --> 22:39.920]  Hi, Ted Anderson, the federal debt and risk of financial crises document the CBO has published
[22:39.920 --> 22:41.880]  as a must-read for every American.
[22:41.880 --> 22:46.520]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population and rising interest rates spells
[22:46.520 --> 22:48.080]  economic disaster.

[22:52.360 --> 22:55.520]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[22:55.520 --> 22:57.160]  Ask for the CBO document.
[22:57.160 --> 23:00.160]  Call 800-686-2237.
[23:00.160 --> 23:03.280]  Did you know that you can be tracked and traced when you're online?
