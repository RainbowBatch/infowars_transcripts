big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
Alex Jones
ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Wednesday the 13th
day of February 2013 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and we are
going to have open phones as well again thank you so much for joining us here
today I am your host Alex Jones a lot of these video and audio clips are gonna be
playing speak for themselves two hours before Chris Dorner reportedly got
burned up inside of that to cabin after killing another sheriff's deputy in Big
Bear outside Los Angeles up in the mountains and then on top of it well I
guess the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department on top of it you know also
seeing the SWAT team surround it and all the rest of this I shot a video two
hours before saying that I expect to see it go up in flames we're gonna play that
clip coming up people are like how on earth did you know this well the
standard procedure with someone held up in a house with a firearm that's already
killed police or government gods is to use an armored vehicle or tank to knock
down the walls and then set the place on fire that's what they did at Waco and
that's why Waco was so evil because David Koresh could have been picked up
in town at any time he went into town every day they had an auto repair shop
a couple miles away he went into town to the grocery store he he jogged outside
the Branch Davidian ranch that they called a compound to dehumanize them and
they went to have a PR stunt with the ATF to shoot the place up the Davidians
fought back so then they had the military come in and engage in a siege
and burn the place down shoot people trying to get out and blew up the little
newborn babies and people and then posed with their skulls later these were not
warriors these were these were psychopathic demons and you see the LAPD
not even apologizing for shooting up vehicles that didn't even match the
description you see just the insanity of the government cult and it is a
government cult these people in these corrupt police departments think they're
rock stars and the government bureaucrats above them think they're
royalty anybody who's worked around them has seen it for themselves and America
is going the same way as any other corrupt Empire now that said Dorner I
thought from the beginning this was a real story just because it looks like a
real story it acts like one that the government's all disjointed and badly
coordinated and in the Asian PR disasters when you see real staged
events the script is written minute one and it all rolls out and they have their
targeted liberty that they're trying to take or the power they're trying to
seize but it was not a hard prediction we're gonna play a clip of this here in
a moment that they would burn it down first there's a clip of San Bernardino
sheriff's on the radios talking with the LAPD who was not in charge officially
but was in charge they brought in the SWAT teams and the armored vehicles and
they're talking about let's just go ahead and play the clip right now here
it is oh yeah yeah yeah the clip we're gonna play is cops burn that house down
believe but you know we're not gonna go to it now we're gonna have a meeting
during the break and then we're gonna play it after the break we're gonna do
that okay because I've got a video list right here in my hand and when we come
back we're gonna go according to this list okay now I understand so again
we're gonna come in we're gonna play the clips that are up at info Wars calm in

live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
well Christopher Dorner went out Waco style and I know the establishment is
not happy because there wasn't 28 children 17 of them under the age of 10
many of them newborn babies or toddlers this wasn't a real trophy event where
they could pose with the dead children skulls and their dead bodies to show off
what tough guys they are like when you watch Waco the rules of engagement it
shows DoD snipers and ATF at FBI snipers standing around bragging about how
they're honed honed to kill and just incredibly manly to have the tanks knock
down the walls and shoot Davidians as they tried to get out and then put a
anti-personnel a shape-charge mine on top of the church records vault and kill
everybody inside in fact the only thing more manly was the LAPD big fans of what
they did shooting up a truck a different make and model and brand and color
Dorners driving a silver pickup well if you see a blue pickup doing a paper
route with two women that's obviously Dorner no different color women a woman
in the back throwing papers out open fire you know shoot them up shoot them
both you know you pull a white guy over in a car tell them go ahead and leave
and then ram him ten seconds later and shoot his vehicle up good good in fact I
think they ought to just have gunships flying in AC 130s with Gatling guns but
also a 10 warthogs and just fly up and down the major Los Angeles and Southern
California roads and just open fire like it was the highway of death outside of
Kuwait going into Iraq and just take them out because because it that would
be like a sacrifice that's why government always demands human
sacrifice once it gets powerful enough is that the public needs to be taught
you are the food you are the food you are here to be eaten for dinner and I
think it's absolutely wonderful and again I think it's wonderful what
happened last night so I was able to predict two hours before I said I think
they're gonna burn him down Waco style and we're gonna play a clip of that
where I predicted it uploaded it time stamp to YouTube time stamp to info wars
calm because it's standard procedure to go on with a tank and ram it and then
tell the media cut the feed just like Waco and they'll do it if we do it and
we'll put your says this is unprecedented no it's not they cut the
feed I shot a video one minute after and uploaded it called Chris Dorner torched
Waco style and we break down the fact that in fact that's the video I shot
actually after after I was confirmed right if you actually go to info wars
calm there's another article there you go to our YouTube page and I break it
all down I'll give you the actual name of that video here in just a moment yes
it's Chris Dorner CNN cuts live feed Alex Jones predicts they will burn him
Waco style that is the actual name of a video that I put out roughly two hours
before the the torching you see the videos I shot Chris Dorner cornered CNN
cuts live feed I predict they'll torch him then checkpoints paralyzed big bear
and then after it happened well while it was starting to burn Chris Dorner torched
Waco style and it was not hard to know the standard default infantry training
that SWAT teams and they are domestic military groups it's against the law
against the Constitution Miller eyes but doesn't matter because a military fights
an enemy and so that that's why the public is now seen as the enemy by more
and more of these departments and paramilitary groups and I understand the
need for special teams sometimes but they're using them for checkpoints on
the highways now they're that they've got military drills all over the country
and they're now admitting oh we are acclimating you and we're working with
the local police department with role players screaming I'm not turning my
guns in and saying you know I need food see they're preparing for a collapse in
a war with the American people in the reorganization of the country so I was
being a little bit sarcastic they're saying you know this is all wonderful
this is actually horrible and see I don't hate the police out of hand
they're just brainwashed Americans like everybody else and when I see these
really corrupt out of control fear driven running off the edge of a cliff
from their own shadow it really freaks me out it freaks me out that they're
shooting up cars and running checkpoints and beating people up and I watched live
feeds from helicopters as they had traffic backed up 20 miles up in the
mountains by Big Bear and they would actually aim guns at families in their
cars and and and go through their cars when they knew Dorner was surrounded and
they pinned him in the house it was just all a big excuse to power grab I mean
I've seen cases now where there'll be a bank robbery and they'll shut down major
highways and then just have guns aimed at people as they drive up and again
it's this attitude of we're gonna March your kids out of the school in a drill
we're gonna put our hands on you with the TSA we're gonna set up warrantless
checkpoints I mean this is America becoming North Korea and obviously I am
pretty freaked out right now by the fact that they did another Waco style event
and they didn't know if he had hostages in there I mean if they would have had
17 little children under the age of 10 would they have barbecued him and then
said that said that Dorner said it now now here's the deal this just shows the
lying culture now out in the open out in everyone's face we're gonna play some of
the clips the news clip in the scanner clip here in a moment thinking into
Obama's State of the Union but imagine how obvious it is when they say they're
asking the media to cut the live feeds as they're surrounding and have armored
wheeled tanks pulling up about to do an infantry maneuver standard military
maneuver knock down the walls when you've got infantry inside and they
don't have any tank weapons and then fire bomb it I mean it's one-on-one or
bring a helicopter in like Randy Weaver with a big bucket of gasoline that they
can remote control and drop on top of the house but media didn't follow orders
and caught it on video so they backed off because media was going into the
woods and covering it because it's like a big turkey shoot hey we got women and
kids in here let's shoot mama with a baby in her arms let's shoot a little
kid in the back and because to these guys because these aren't real men these
aren't soldiers these aren't these are people that it's like hunting these are
arrested development wimps I've studied their mo these types who in just enjoy
killing people but from a distance in a controlled way like Lon Horiuchi the
sniper where they feel powerful and you see the culture of the drones and all of
this and it totally dehumanizes everyone and and on the other side of it you've
got the public running around saying kill the cops kill more great job
Dorner team Dorner and all this garbage somebody ought to make an image of Obama
in a jersey that has a zero on it and says team Dorner because he's anti-gun
anti the citizens owning guns pro-government a total statist who was
mad that he was thrown out of the cult and was going to show the cult to the
feds hey I'm gonna give you trouble in a PR disaster I'm gonna throw a big giant
temper tantrum I'm gonna go shoot a police captain's daughter and people are
defending that so the police are turning into demons the public's turning into
demons America accepts torture abortion secret arrest warrantless wiretapping
injustice and now all the prosperity is going out the window all the liberties
going out the window now our story we broke this yesterday as it was happening
that clearly they cut the power they knew that place they talked to the
owner they knew that that that that house did not that cabin did not have
cable in it they knew they could cut the power with the power lines and it turns
out they had cut the power okay they simply wanted to burn that thing down
same thing at Waco they told the media okay you've been a mile away get back
three miles so they had to have telephoto lenses what German film crew
to even catch the compound burning that would have never even been seen until
later okay the big wooden charts with a concrete building inside and but instead
the FLIR footage got leaked by Patriots and the government didn't like what was
happening they later killed the former CIA director over the league later died
in his quote kayak remember that but I had the inside sources on where the
FLIR came from then it was later confirmed to be the real FLIR and its
infantry behind the armored vehicles going into the building behind it
shooting the people setting the fires everything and it later came out in
Congress Delta Force said quote we were ordered to go in and pull triggers so
now we have the new clips from the news with San Bernardino on the open scanners
saying burn that mother effort down burn it down we're gonna play that clip in a
moment and then we have the actual scanner of the tank inside planting the
fire bombs planting the fire bombs and they say okay we planted them we planted
the burners now the fire is lit okay good job they're so arrogant now they
cut the feed burn it down in front of you and then tell you they didn't burn
it down and you watch they're gonna say Dorner burned it down Dorner burned it
down I mean how many times to SWAT teams shoot their own officers and then frame
the person's house they've come in it's a culture of they come first they're a
gang and you're nobody now not all departments have succumbed to this but
the big cities mainly have and it's it's despicable and and we know the threat to
the public in North Korea is the police we know the threat to the public in
Mexico's the police do we want our police to become like that because they
are by every historical and sociological benchmark let's go to a clip from KC AL
boy and they they glazed over this the media is now acting like nothing
happened that's a whole nother story only drudgereport.com is carrying our
stories and getting it out there and it's on talk radio everywhere and the
story is getting out because of info Wars calm because of drudgereport.com
let's go to break with KC AL here it is
Carter Evans it sounds like police officials were trying to move Carter out
of the area into a safer area we do know that authorities were searching for a
man in a Dodge pickup truck all right that's enough
you know the drudgereport.com of on the left-hand side all the links they're
also at info Wars calm obviously it's an info war story now we have the even more
powerful scanner of inside the tank to to to the command post on the hill as
they plant the fire bombs now now here's the deal you're gonna be called a

only on the GCN radio network
already just joined us somebody breaking down Obama's incredibly chilling state
of the Union what's really happening with the economy when he said hey if
Congress doesn't act on carbon taxes which will totally shut us down which
they're doing on purpose he said I'll do it on my own so Congress has got to
start the impeachment process right now the problem is most of the leadership's
bought and paid for this country is in deep deep trouble that's coming up in
the next segment we're gonna open the phones up for your take on the Waco
style barbecuing of Dorner of course they say they've found his body in the
building but people are saying Alex how did you call this that you know they've
cut the feed and it's probably so they can burn him out Waco style that's it's
like how did I predict the Sun would come up this morning see that's what's
so frustrating when you're awake you can call stuff about 90% of the time no
exaggeration back more than that I just don't want to sound arrogant it's not
arrogance this is the there's the real world and then there's what we're taught
all day and there is almost no mainstream media there's a few LA
articles going did the SWAT team said it what is it what is this audio mean it's
kind of like when the UN officials a few weeks ago the people the UN funded
controlled mandated communist Chinese put the baby behind the car the 13
month-old baby that the parents had hid their second child and they run over it
with a car and then the ABC News headline was
baby run over in China by car with population control officials in it
like not not population control tyrants run over baby it's like well a car ran
over a baby and happen to have some population control officials in it this
is how they spin everything so now we have the matrix being more and more
obvious here of propaganda where they cut the feeds on the helicopters I've
got reports where they quote ordered the local news but some of the local news
didn't follow orders you see oh we better get rid of that First Amendment
and still carried the audio and the local news and I've got the reports
right here said hey it's audio of the scanners how do we know he doesn't have
a scanner no we're going to run this and see they've scrambled most the scanners
in the last few years it's gone to this federal system and they've unified the
codes but still there's a lot of cops out there who were kind of having a you
know a big pity party hysteria party who were so uncontrolled you know they're
shooting up cars the wrong color do you imagine oh there's a white guy in a
silver car let's shoot that up there's some women throwing newspapers out of a
blue truck looks nothing like Dorners truck that's silver let's just shoot
them up I mean that's that's Yosemite Sam level just and and this is the
government that's got the helicopters the checkpoints the guns the weapons the
surveillance it's why the founders said keep that government small keep it under
control because governments like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful
master and that's the terrorist of course George Washington that FEMA
demonizes all day and I know police I've heard them all over talk radio and in
the news all over the country they're marveling and how unprofessional the LAPD
is but it's beyond that it's a bunch of crazy people I'm not saying they're all
crazy but I mean just bad leadership unaccountable and then they they talk on
the scanners okay you've broken through put the burners down and burn them up
like we planned okay the burners are ignited the house is on fire I mean open
and shut and you've got the cops outside running around screaming in front of
news just just like totally turned over to rage because it's a cult it's like
crying for Kim Jong-il when he died all the fake days of crying the more they
show off and cry for the dead officer they just killed he just reportedly shot
and I get it you know guy died it's what you signed on for I'm sad you're dead
you get a great pension for your family you know you have a nice parade you
signed on to be a tough guy okay hey you signed on to do this by frankly sounds
pretty exciting to me I mean you you signed on for all this and people are
gonna die I mean that's what you signed on for and I'm sad the cops dead but what
about the citizens that are getting shot up and and so the police are freaking
out screaming burn that mother ever you know we played the clip earlier we'll
play it again but when we come back from break I'm gonna play the raw scanner
which they admits theirs and I don't know how they're going to spin this this
is from KC AL from the big LA station down the hill this is all police scanner
audio directly off the news channels and it's the armored tank the wheel tank
knocking all knocking down through three of the walls one walls left standing
they hear a gunshot he probably killed himself
Dorner and then they set the place on fire and burn the place up and people
need to understand this is the default position okay they do this all the time
there have been many cases of them burning out Patriots and people I mean
if they know you're a veteran or they know you know how to use a gun they're
not gonna go in to capture you and take you to trial and some could argue well
he's already killed a bunch of people you know burn him out point is don't cut
the feed burn it out and say you didn't do it okay stop treating us like we're
stupid stop being filled with hypocrisy we'll be back stay with us we're on the
March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time we are here
live I want to give the number out specifically on the state of the Union
a and B I want to give the number out on the Christopher Dorner funeral pyre
going out like the children did at Waco because again I'm not crying tears over
this guy getting killed because all the mo looks like this is a real story at a
real event from the paramilitary police force that we've created in this country
it's going to bite itself in the butt militaries have always killed each other
there's always been friendly fire there's always been fragging this stuff
goes on especially as a lot of people get into these positions to go out and
be able to kill people you know I mean they're getting into it to go out and
kill people where they can legally and lawfully kill people as psychopaths and
I'd say 20% of cops are that type of person now and they've absolutely got to
be removed but instead they're being put in positions of power but I want to get
your take on Obama State of the Union and I haven't gotten to yet I'll play
some clips in a moment and I want to get your take on what you saw yesterday but
we've got a couple clips we're going to play now let's just get to the KC al
clip we've already played then I'll get to the other clips I haven't played yet
this is 51 second clip on the local TV station where they've got feeds from the
ground with police running around screaming burn that house down bleep
burn that mother bleep down and then we have the audio inside the tank back to
the command post on the scanner on an open radio channel that's how dumb they
think you are they're going to do something illegal they're going to
purposely burn this guy up so they don't have to get killed taking him you know
going in and taking him out or trying to get him to surrender they just want to
get this over with okay clearly he was never going to surrender so I can see
the psychology of that but
still the media is compliantly turning off the feed so we couldn't see what
really happened is the tank knocked down the walls and conveniently now they're
saying oh never mind what you heard just go to sleep and it's the same on every
other big issue or I see on the news we're going to blow up building 7 for
the other building safety saw it on the news heard it on the radio have the
clips cops saying get back we're blowing it up and I go hey they said they blew
that up oh shut up you think the government did it you what do you work
for bin Laden I'm like no criminal elements run al-qaeda and they're going
to use al-qaeda to attack us to take our Liberty why'd they blow up building 7
this needs to be investigated it didn't exist I'm like well I have the video
clips never mind those children never mind and it's the same thing now never
mind never mind never mind that you saw them cut the feed and then you have
multiple audio clips of the police saying we're gonna burn him up and I'm
gonna get to those right now just just forget you ever saw that and forget the
dying Corps has been caught running kidnapped children on record and the UN
has over and over again and you know forget the government's been caught
shipping narcotics in over and over again and forget the NSA's warrantless
Lee wiretapping you and forget that they're setting up warrantless
checkpoints now searching your vehicles and forget the fact they're introducing
legislation to physically confiscate your guns in multiple states and at the
federal level just forget it forget the fact they're shutting down our power
plants and raising our taxes to bankrupt us to bring us into government
receivership forget all that forget agenda 21 everything's fine the
government loves us they never lie to us it is this attitude that allows them to
cut a feed torch a building say they're going to torch it and then there's no
discussion about you just illegally killed somebody and we're all supposed
to just play along with the lie now let's go to that clip we've already
played and then to the new clips KC AL here it is
Carter Evans it sounds like police officials were trying to move Carter out
of the area into a safer area we do know that authorities were searching for a
man in a Dodge pickup truck
okay so that's when the gunfight was going on and you see fire you see smoke
not just not just from firearms that went out live and then that was taped
live off television and the media is trying to cover that up they were
clearly trying to set the place on fire then okay and then this they wanted to
be the heroes and set it on fire and burning out but they got driven back a
couple of them got shot and remember he's down the hill earlier with a
kidnapped couple he'd been there for days how do they know there weren't
people inside the building now let's go to the next clip this is from the
armored vehicle the wheeled tank that's rammed down three of the walls it's
about to ram down the fourth wall and they are going to then quote place the
burners the burners wonder what that means and then in case they can spin
that oh well we don't mean we pull building seven or we don't mean you
know burners mean burners they go okay burners ignited okay the fire is set
sounds like pretty clear English to me like the right to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed all right I'm placing the burners all right the
burners are ignited okay the fire is going I mean it's like hey honey we set
a fire on the barbecue pistol and cook some stuff yeah I'm putting the coals in
right now okay I've ignited it the fire is lit so let's go ahead and go to that
clip right now here it is
we're not quite there I still have the two three corner that is all multiple
tell far we're just bringing fire in about 200 yards out your call
break 61 Lincoln 61 Charlie you ready for fire
I still don't have adequate penetration on the 2-3 or the 3-4 and I still have wide ammo popping.
all right they wanted to get to that basement and burn him out that was the
main goal that was the main push that they were going for now we've got the
police running around saying burn it burn up the house clearly trying to burn
it up during the first firefight launching something at it whether it was
the flammable type of tear gas rounds that are somewhat good at starting fires
if you listen later we don't know what happened I mean almost sounds like they
have flamethrowers I know a lot of the military terminology at least when I
read about World War two was they would call flamethrowers burners they would go
in and flamethrow people hiding in holes they go bring in burners maybe I mean
I've heard the radio transmissions seen the documentaries they'd go you look
this up in the terminology they'd say you know we're 500 yards out with a
burner and that's military terminology I don't know if it's changed since Korea
and Vietnam World War two but I mean it might have been a flamethrower for all
we know the LAPD's got everything in the world and by the way the San Bernardino
County and in Big Bear they were quote in charge the sheriff was in charge but
it was the LAPD that was choppered in with the equipment there their vehicles
brought in you know trucked in on 18 wheelers they were running the show sure
the sheriff was in charge but he was like okay you're the quarterback go in
there I almost went up the phones up for police and get their take on this but
we'll do that after the first round of calls 800-259-9231
800-259-9231 and we'll get your take on the Doerner situation a state of the
Union that's the topic I don't screen your calls but when I say hey I want to
hear from you on this that's what we're talking about so that's what I want to
hear from you on I really want to hear what you have to say on those subjects
800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air and we have a guest
popping in on the hurricane and the aftermath of that a few months ago and
then now this new winter storm and just how government isn't responding and is
actually raising property taxes on people stuff we've got a guest on us
for about 15 minutes at the bottom of the next hour but that's it the rest of
the show is gonna be news and open phones today we've got a lot of other
key clips we're gonna play from the whole state of the Union last night but
for me this illustrates the absurdity of all of this now you can go see it
timestamped at YouTube timestamped at info wars calm prison planet calm about
two hours before they torched it as they were getting the armored vehicles off
the 18 wheelers I saw that they said oh the police have asked it's
unprecedented for them to cut the feed we've got a clip of that coming up with
wolf blitzer and the other channels did it then they started demanding that the
scanners be cut they're like well you can't see that he may have a scanner and
most news did a few did and that's how we had those clips you just heard I mean
I guess they just think they're God now they order the media to stand down so
they can do whatever so that and again this guy you can say he was bad if he
was guilty and a lot of evidence points that direction but do you want to be
surrounded to have your house burned down and they just say you were a child
killer corrupt governments will frame people and our government's been caught
framing people and major crime labs the LAPD crime lab the Houston crime lab the
FBI crime lab the San Francisco crime lab the Dallas crime lab almost every
crime lab if you look up the name of your major city crime lab scandal you
you'll see people being framed I mean I was exposing police stealing drugs where
I grew up in Rockwall Texas and they called me in the office and said we're
gonna say you stole stereo equipment out of some trailer park and I said I'd have
never sold anything but a but beer out of people's golf carts when I and there
the cops like look I know that you're gonna be raped and given AIDS and he
said some other things racist stuff and then slammed my head down in the thing
and said you know you basically you're dead if you don't shut up and then my
dad got the word they were gonna kill me if we didn't move we moved to Austin
Texas because of this I have experienced a cop sitting there going up we know you
stole that stereo equipment we're gonna get you for that if you don't shut up
about the other trouble you've been causing and you're like I don't still
anything in years I think I've stole beer on people's golf carts stand up
stand up right here for me slam my head in the thing listen you little you know
the whole thing was spit dripping out of his mouth so I have experienced it and I
was just like stop pulling us over and trying to search for drugs when we're a
bunch of you know crap-kicking jock you know cowboy hat wearing beer drinkers
stop saying we're doing drugs when you're the ones selling them boys I'm
already digressing I just the public is so naive ladies and gentlemen the public
is so absolutely naive they have no idea no idea what's really going on in this
country and that's why we're being absolutely robbed and now some people
are awake but their answer is just kill all the police we've seen that all over
the news like the knees like well I guess Dorner did have a point perhaps he
is good and yeah you know go Dorner kill more cops yeah let's just randomly kill
cops I mean you're you're you're light years worse than these police and it
just shows a society absolutely falling apart absolutely falling apart killing
the police isn't going to do anything but get a civil war going most police
are good men and women most departments are revenue generating they don't know
they're designed to ruin the economy they don't know why people hate them
because they want the money to pay these tickets I mean I was talking to one of
my crew he was up there dealing with a ticket he saw poor families and stuff
you know two three thousand dollar stuff on tickets and things now they've jacked
up in Texas and the people turn around and cry because that's that's the
that's the grocery money folks I mean this country's in a depression and
they're just squeezing and so even quote good cops have an evil job now because
the government's evil you have an evil mission I don't care what propaganda you
put on it but they're not individually evil and we want to avoid the civil war
if you know they start coming for people and stuff it's the gloves are off and
it's gonna be a million times I mean way more than million times Dorner that's
why the system is gonna stage stuff to get the psychological war one to blame
anyone that resists as terrorists but the system should look the public hates
you so much they're wanting the public to kill your children I mean and that's
why I don't want a revolution a lot of times revolutions create something worse
than what you had I want the Republic back I want due process back I want
honorable behavior back I want to put this monster back in the cage okay
believe me I got a family I've studied history I'm getting chills right now
this country's on the edge of a powder keg and the government's gearing up for
checkpoints martial law you know to crush the resistance once it starts
they're gonna start the resistance you idiots out there in law enforcement
maybe you're not as naive as the public but you still don't get the trap you're
being set up for
let's go out to break with my prediction I'm not gonna play the whole thing but
where I play the wolf bloods are in the rest of it let's go ahead and go to the
clip that's up at info wars calm here it is two hours before they torched him the
Chris Dorner fiasco appears to be coming to a head Alex Jones with info wars calm
news alert we were just in here watching CNN they claim that they've cornered him
in some house there's been some type of shootout in Big Bear California up in
the snow-capped mountains the issue here though is that now CNN especially
refuses to show live footage and it's just telling us what they're seeing from
the helicopter in the past this was never done except for situations like
Waco where they ordered the news cameras back and then the place blew up in
flames he's reportedly got several hostages inside there what the police
tend to do and the military tends to do the situation like this where they've
lost some of their own they don't care about 17 little children under the age
of 10 in the Waco compound they blew it up and burned to the ground and I hope
that doesn't happen here but regardless this is why people don't believe
official stories it's because over and over again we're gonna play the clip in
a moment the establishment media is caught lying about things spinning
things and they're not letting us see what's really happening a few weeks ago
at a shooting in Houston at a community college they cut the feed and we're
saying different things than what we were watching on local Texas television
with live feeds they kept showing the scariest footage over and over again
they also do that to control the narrative and what's put out but here's
the bottom line we have our guns because of government people like the alleged
killer Chris Dorner they go crazy when the government has all the guns there's
tyranny when the people have the guns there is liberty when the government
fears the people there is liberty when the people fear the government there is
tyranny that's Thomas Jefferson it's common sense but let's go ahead and show
you this clip and again they're still saying earlier Commissioner it's a wolf
blitzer we're watching what's going on here in the Situation Room as well we
are now showing our viewers videotape of the aerial area after a law enforcement
asked us not no longer to show live pictures because that could help this
suspect in this particular case potentially escape so what we're what
our viewers now are seeing is videotape we're no longer going to show the line
just we're gonna break and I go on to finish the clip and blitzer of course
talked about this is unprecedented well except for Waco in places and I say
that's when they're usually going to torch something so there's the
prediction the full videos up at info Wars Tom your calls are straight ahead
then the State of the Union right now scariest ever looking back on 2012 I
know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year

either provis here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take about 30 40 minutes of
calls and then I'm gonna properly get into Obama State of the Union because
I'll be honest I didn't watch it last night I read the transcript this morning
I read the whole stinking thing and then I went and found some of the clips and
the crew found some and economic development zones taking over the
internet with executive orders outside of Congress into free speech as you know
it really even mainstream media says that Chinese style net censorship carbon
taxes executive orders even if Congress quote won't act we got a clip of that in
a moment during the break I was looking at this again it's just making my head
spin I mean it's it's it's all happening I mean they're burning up people alive
and saying they didn't in front of us let's burn him up okay but we didn't
burn him up I mean it it's reached cuckoo level and I've got the economic
niche they want to deep six things they want you poor on record this is not an
opinion this is so diabolical and I just want prosperity but see they don't want
that they don't want you to be independent and it makes me so mad
because it's so over-the-top we should just be able to wake up to this
now I said I'd go to your phone calls a sandy Carl Abby Bobby Jason we're gonna

gonna open it up for police to call in and give us their take on what they've
seen and heard shooting innocent people the infantry tactic of using the armed
vehicle around on the walls and set it on fire just reminds me of Waco makes me
so angry one thing to kill this guy you can debate that all day but man I tell
you those little kids and how the system lied about that really despicable and
shows you what the system will do have ordered the top people they've hired so
we're gonna talk about all that coming up now the phone lines are full right
now but police out there here's the number so after you hear somebody hang
up you can get in it's 800 to 5 at 9 9 2 3 1 let's play this chilling clip of
Obama saying he'll do whatever he wants if Congress doesn't bring in the UN
carbon tax here it is now the good news is we can make meaningful progress on
this issue while driving strong economic growth I urge this Congress to get
together pursue a bipartisan market-based solution to climate change
like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few
years ago but if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations I will I
will direct I will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can
take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for
the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable
sources of energy that means shutting down our power plants and then giving
boondoggles the energy companies that don't exist
millions of dollars to their friends this is a mafia I don't care if they
land in Air Force One helicopters I don't care they're wearing fancy suits
and green ribbons for Sandy Hook for what they probably did you know the
issue is we're in trouble and the globalists have built China up as the
new command base they have no standards or regulations on them we have them
piled on us it's over it'd be like playing a football field where one team
is up on the mountain with a Gatling gun and and you've got rocks and stones and
you've got to go up and beat them when they've got a machine gun at the top of
the hill I mean it's that slanted but if we wake up to the scam we can just say
wait this is all a giant fraud but instead it's all about how he's gonna
get you jobs what Obama's gonna do is put you on welfare to run your life
this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network you prepare by purchasing

radio network
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
Alex Jones
all right we're taking your calls in the shower we're gonna recap the Dorner
Waco torching and the government thinking we're so dumb they admit on the
scanners they burned him up try to deny it we're going to Obama State of the
Union and as I said take your phone calls and a bunch of news on the economy
that's bone-chilling but again knowing about this and understanding it's
premeditated is half the battle sandy in Wisconsin you're on the air thanks for
holding yeah Alex I just gotta say I want the officers to know my son-in-law
was an officer up until maybe seven months ago because his captain came in
it was a new military guy he saw changes coming but we need to let these officers
know don't leave we need the good ones in there we you know they're gonna get
scared they don't like the changes but the more good ones we get in there the
more they can change these well it's not just the military guys are sending in to
command them are bad they're getting the bad guys out of the military they were
psychos just want to kill people they're putting them in charge yeah I mean they're
all the look and everything they had to do now was a complete change well it's
all meant to intimidate people and instead it's getting the public thinking
it's an occupying army and wanting to like white blood cells to attack the
invader and then last night a bunch of us were watching you know the president
and of course Gerald Cilenti my other hero next to you was tweeting back and
forth with some of us on Facebook and things and all I kept thinking is if
before Hitler could have gotten his hands on anybody if we would have had
the system we have now to get information out it probably wouldn't
have happened but I'm afraid if Obama gets the internet control we will lose
this battle very quickly I absolutely agree with you
well get Obama's there is the puppet who's supposed to bring in the change
then he takes all the blame so the globalist in case they lose this round
don't don't get in trouble but but it's important to politically shoot down
Obama's agenda as well because that's what they're rolling this through on but
you've got to understand it's just the latest salvo the latest missile coming
in that our Aegis or Aegis system has to shoot down we need to understand there's
a command ship launching these these people at us thank you for the call
sandy Abby in Pennsylvania you're on the air
hi Alex I had an well what do you think I was saying about the Dorna case with
the wallet they found apparently found it close to Mexico on the side of the
road and then all of a sudden they find it in the building after it burns down I
mean I think that's kind of coincidental that they find his wallet sure there's
about maybe there's a 5% chance this could be a state psi op it's just that
it's so bad for them and it shows how pathetically weak they are to to
asymmetrical resistance such a PR disaster and shooting up innocent
people's cars let me tell you I mean just all the mo of this looks like it's
real I was also reading online I found a few news things online that were saying
that the manifesto that he made was actually altered and changed there's two
different versions of it he was putting it on Facebook and other sites I mean
listen listen I've read Fruit Loop narcissist tough guy stuff this is if he
didn't write this the person deserves a Nobel Prize in literature saying that
he's innocent or guilty I'm just saying I think it's kind of funny that all this
contradiction stuff is coming out and it's blatantly obvious I mean it's like
they're not even trying to cover it up anymore
no nobody oh oh he did it oh he's a bad guy go kill him and stuff and then they
open up the investigation to appease him I mean no I won't see that was to make
it look like because they make him a bad guy welcome the bad guy be winning so
they just went with the political correctness because he's an Obama
supporter and an anti-gun guy the media was kind of like well maybe he is good
then you know cuz cuz see once they fully take over they're gonna hang the
cops out to dry and the military as well they're already hanging the military out
to dry so god bless you good points look if the government's a bunch of
congenital liars I don't out of hand believe what they say but I've just
studied that look I knew they were gonna burn him out yesterday I mean I was even
more directly opposite they will burn him up watch this so you know the point
is is that I know these people okay I know how they operate this is a PR
nightmare for them Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth

Alex Jones
all right my friends we're now into our number two we're gonna have open phones
throughout the next two hours we have a guest popping in to break down some key
Intel I'm also lining up guests tomorrow radio talk show hosts who live right in
the area of where Dorner was reportedly torched Waco style yesterday who know
people that were right in the very vicinity so they're there today doing an
investigation we'll have some of those folks on like dr. Cory gold tomorrow who
lives in the area to break that down with us we'd have them on today but he's
in the area investigating right now so he'll be joining us tomorrow so we don't
go off so we don't go off half-cocked and Joseph Farah is on tomorrow to talk
about his prediction of just Obama going hog-wild with carbon taxes police state
cybersecurity that's all tomorrow as well you know I've got these clips and
and we're gonna cover this mainly in the next hours I wanna go to calls right now
where Obama you know said hey if Congress doesn't bring in carbon taxes
I'm gonna do it with executive orders and he's really trying to sell the
dictator angle to try to get that out there if I'll get the economy going just
let me be a dictator very very serious and they've got so many reasons to
impeach him already putting our troops under UN control NATO control trying to
keep cybersecurity orders secret from Congress saying they have no authority
this is just all fast and furious totally impeachable why is it not
happening now I got loaded phones here after we go to these five or six callers
that are on the top of the board I want to leave the new phone lines that are
open for police current police who'd like to call in or form or whatever to
give us your take on what we've seen the LAPD shooting up innocent vehicles and
people that are a white guy in a car doesn't match the description shoot it
up imagine being a black guy in a similar truck I mean you don't deserve
to die women you know white women in a blue truck different make-model different
company shoot them up and then the audio caught live on the news of the scanner
them saying burn it down burn the mother effort down I'm gonna play a clip of
that in a moment and then the actual scanner audio they asked the news to cut
but one of them didn't this is confirmed where they bring in the armored vehicle
knock down the walls and then say okay we got the fire we're gonna bring the
fire in okay set the burners they're ignited the place is on fire I mean they
way code it now I'm glad there weren't 17 little children in there and and I'm
no fan of this guy but I mean the due process out the window and now we'll
never know the truth I mean I tend to see the manifesto the witnesses to what
he was doing the phone calls made I mean it sounds like it's a real story a real
rogue you know sometimes things are real they're not staged the way it's all a PR
disaster you know shows you that's probably not staged when they stage
something they've got their ducks in a row like Aurora definitely staged I mean
my goodness the guy got DARPA funding Department of Defense was over that guy
five different psychotropics witnesses of other people said he was under mind
control it's been declassified Surin Surin was under mind control I mean you
know this stuff's all coming out but this is very suspicious I want to play
these clips again and go to your phone calls for people that are holding like
Ron in New York former police officer Robert in Florida Bobby Jason many
others that are patiently holding right now the toll-free number for police to
call in is eight hundred two five at nine nine two three one just wait till
you hear somebody hang up and then call in callers please just I'm gonna hear
from the police so as we take these calls don't try to call in nothing one
listens to me police only after I take these calls eight hundred two five at
nine nine two three one we got to move quick here let's go to the local TV clip
and again the video of this is all up on info wars calm prison planet calm and
drudge report calm is carrying our well we broke this so thanks to drudge
putting it out now it's broken everywhere and it's getting past the
mainstream media ignoring it this is all of I tuned into three talk radio shows I
called into 590 and I tuned into WLA I and I tuned in to Big Dallas station I
forget which one I forget the call there so I'm getting old and they were all
talking about them burning it down when I tuned in stuck in traffic for like an
hour this morning really bad traffic but side issue it was all drudge that's why
so our report is mega viral right now out at info wars calm via drudge drudge
report calm okay let's go to this first clip from KC AL we've bleeped the cuss
words with the police saying burn that mother effer down here it is
and then they run over to the reporter and tell him get out of the area police
officers understandably upset and again that was a live and a little listener
there in the area shot it off the video off the TV they don't want this stuff
being seen now here is the official scanner they wanted cut but didn't get
cut here is the armored vehicle knocking down the walls and setting it on fire
bombshell that they would do this in front of everyone and you watch it'll
never even be an issue you're a conspiracy I guarantee you there will be
articles out by this afternoon if not now I have a check saying Matt drudge is
crazy Alex Jones is crazy you know it's a conspiracy theory that that they burn
this down guarantee doesn't matter you got them they burn it down boom they're
gonna again if you said two plus two equal four they'd say you were
conspiracy theorist if you know how to tie your shoelaces you're a conspiracy
theorist you watch Obama shutting down power plants every week everybody going
bankrupt our power prices going up say that's bad for the economy you're
conspiracy terrorist if you got common sense you're conspiracy theorist well
welcome to conspiracy theory let's go ahead and go to the next clip here it is
the unedited audio is a bunch of it is up and in full or start
com right now in the article
police audio from donor siege burned this mother bleep all right we're gonna
go ahead with the plan with the burners and we cut the spaces out of that for
radio you know here where where the guys going okay place the burners just like
we talked about in private yes place the burners do it we ought to just air the
whole thing I mean it's so ridiculous and if they would do this I think we
don't know what's going on okay we'll go to Ron in New York former police officer
Mr. Ron I know he's been giving us great info for about 13 years we got to move
quick Ron what's your take on this whole situation with daughter I thought it's
strange they now said you know there's always weird things every time something
like this happens it never adds up the connects right they said that they found
his driver's license near his body now first off how could a driver's license
survive that inferno second off why would a guy who didn't care less about
murdering a number of people like a good citizen carries driver's license around
like he was afraid that he was you know gonna get stopped for a speeding ticket
and even if by some chance he had his driver's license most people tend to
keep it on them in their back pocket yet they said they found it according to
these reports today near his body in the inferno wreckage which doesn't make
sounds like 9-11 where two passports survived the fireballs made to the
ground and were found that day by the FBI it does sound a lot like that and
plus did you notice another thing here an irony that they finished doing her
off just about a half hour before the State of the Union address like as
though they didn't want it to overshadow the State of the Union offering or
something yeah but I mean here's the deal this is a PR disaster for them the
cops shooting up innocent people and things the kind of narcissism and the
letters I mean my gut tells me that at least a large portion of this is real
I decided because something happened which doesn't happen that often but one
of their own one of the inside is went rogue a loose cannon and of course that
threw them off balance how do you deal with something like that it takes a while
to adjust to it and I think that's what happened but you know Alex getting to
another thing too on another issue with the State of the Union did you notice
that that person John Bonney supposed to be pro-gun right yet when Obama's
mentioned gun control he stood on his feet and chapped and clapped yeah and
John McCain was wearing the ribbons and everything and having little snicker
doodle times it's a bunch of disgusting people you know and also like there was
an article in USA Today with Wayne LaPierre hopping on an issue that's very
similar to the issue with veterans where out of one side of his mouth he says in
the past that's no good in recent past now he's hopping on that and he's kind
of intimating that that is good you know something we not only have enemies to
the front of us that are clearly definable on the Second Amendment but I
think we better be very careful as to who we got to the back of a well you know
he's always been anti-gun at its core but good folks have tried to take it
back over but you're absolutely right got a jump gonna hear from you Ron let's
talk to Robert who's a retired police officer what's your take on this
situation Robert I'm not retired I just didn't I just didn't want to finish out
my term there things are just getting a little bit too political and too heated
for my cup of tea so I'm just curious so what happened with the marshal yesterday
they came in what did he want oh yeah they wanted a source on a story with
Marines saying that this reported shooter of Chris Kyle a sniper had not
not been in combat and then I called him and said you never came back and he said
no we were able to actually confirm that through Marines separately so our story
helped them go confirm with other Marines in the unit that indeed the guy
wasn't a combat marine he was assigned to a mechanics detail so they just want
that so they can try to give him a lethal injection instead of him getting
off on PTSD I mean the whole thing's very suspicious and I wanted to
interrogate the Texas Ranger but he said he was very polite he goes no sir I
can't talk to you now my superiors say click so believe me I wish I would have
gotten a chance to talk to him as I answer your question come back to you
briefly on the other side then we'll go to others that are patiently holding

folks I have two different news articles Alex Jones here back live you just
joined us saying they found his driver's license and passport at two different
places two different times now I I get the fact that the system almost always
lies even when the truth would serve them I just don't see why they'd stage
this when it's a PR disaster but who knows they burned up whoever it is in
that house it's like John Wilkes booth got burned up in the barn the guy that
supposedly shot Lincoln and we know he had accomplices so I mean it's just
they always burn them up so is this a conspiracy to I just don't know anymore
all I know is Obama is up there on television saying if Congress doesn't
put carbon taxes and he's gonna do it unbelievable
Jessica in California says she has info covered not covered in the media there
we're gonna get her info a minute finish up your point Robert the point you
wanted to make about the whole Dorner situation situation just disgust me I
mean well you know like like you said earlier we live in a country where
there's no more due process and no more do anything it's just you know do what
you want and how the dictator can stand up in front of everybody and say okay
I'm gonna do this if you don't do this I mean I don't understand why he's not
being impeached being arrested I mean this is when I talk to people and I try
to spread the word about you and what's going on you know that you know yes you
know they laugh and say you can spit that I tell you know this is supposed to
be the future what's supposed to have jet cars by now my rails to the moon yet
here we are on the verge of 1776 back in the dark ages and the whole thing just
disgust me and how the government is shutting down our power plants that
supply 52% of our power and the economy is going into a tailspin by design and
these people think it's funny what do you make of them torching the compound
torching the house the can't even get it right the going back to Waco the cabin
and then telling us they didn't torch it when they're on tape two different clips
saying they're gonna torch it well it's like you said 90% of the population is
stupid they're gonna say all that didn't happen what are you talking about even
if you played a video or play the audio they're gonna say oh that's just a
Photoshop no matter what you do they're gonna say oh it's just a splice
together thing it ain't real and they're just so dumbed down and it's just
exactly and it allows the criminals in government to take over and push out the
good people and then you get tyranny god bless you good to hear from you let's
go to Jessica says she has info not covered concerning a Dorner and the car
site where he burned up his car Jessica what can you tell us um yeah I was just
calling because the day before all this happened up the street I literally lived
down the street from where it was but up the street there was a controlled burn
the fire department had signs and stuff but I just thought it was a weird time
of year to do that considering we have snow right now and it was very small and
it was in the same area where his car was found the next morning and yeah I
just thought I would let you guys know I just thought it was really weird well
you know I've got to really rack my brain and analyze this why would they
stage this again my gut says it's real the evidence all points there but then
there's a lot of evidence pointing towards cover-up and is it just that
cops want to be heroes so they plant fake passports or they say they found a
driver's license at the Mexican border and now they found it in the cabin and
how did it survive and and it just goes on and on it's just like there's so much
lying who knows what the truth is yeah that's exactly my point like the media
hasn't been reporting on any of this and they in fact one of the houses near mine
got raided the day that his truck was found up here and they said that the
door was left open and it's in a pretty busy neighborhood there's been traffic
up and down all day because of the resort and whatnot and it I don't I
don't know it's just they raided the house and nothing was found they walked
away laughing and he was hiding in the house directly across the street 100
yards away from them the whole time well one of people out in Southern California
think of the police shooting up two vehicles that didn't even match the
description I feel like that's been kind of brushed under the table I feel like
the news makes it not seem as big of a deal as but I mean how do you hire
people so trigger-happy so crazy I mean I've heard of people that you take dear
hunting their first time they get butt fever and they see a cow 300 yards away
and somebody else's property and they shoot cows you see it the news all the
time and and it's like well you didn't know that was a cows in the middle of a
field well I just didn't look like a deer I thought I I thought I and the
truth is they're just crazy people and you've got weirdos that want to be tough
guy heroes who go and become police now and they have no business do I mean it
is crazy it is crazy I mean I've had cops pull me over and they start asking
me questions about PCP and guns and this I'm just like leave me alone man you
know what I mean come on you know you just pulled me over I don't have any
record stop acting like you're you know how about I go search your car
because statistically you're more criminal than anybody else okay I mean
it's true look at criminology there are more criminals in government and in law
enforcement than any other area cuz smart criminals want the badge and the
gun to be able to protect themselves governments who you've got to control

mainstream news today why are they doing urban warfare drills why are they
running checkpoints why is the military working with local police what are they
getting ready for we'll look at Europe this is in a designed implosion but if
the globalists don't think that you're gonna go along with this they'll back
off on the implosion but right now they're going ahead with it and Obama
and I'm gonna play this clip coming up is saying I got a bunch of clips in the
third hour coming up he's saying hey if Congress doesn't act on the carbon taxes
which will destroy us selectively enforced on the US and Europe all the
jobs that are left to leave if we don't do that if we don't go along with that

everything you're talking about is coming true I know it's all in
government white papers they've already done it in other countries prepare for
the worst ladies and gentlemen but hope for the best and of course the famous
saying is hope for the best prepare for the worst this is happening because we
haven't been distrustful we haven't been been paranoid we've been overrun the
founders said if you fight as hard as you can you'll probably lose Liberty the
founders said you can try to protect the jewel of Liberty with everything you've
got you might not be able to keep it thank you probably can't Thomas
Jefferson said that George Washington said that in some more words look it up
and but they said if you don't fight for it you're gonna get a tyranny out of
control they said that Thomas Jefferson in a letter who was he writing to John
Adams John Adams and he said well what will the what will the level be that man
puts up with he was marveling and he said it'll be the level you put up with
whatever you accept that's what you'll live under don't you get it folks when
you bend over wolves are coming I mean if you went out in the middle of the
frozen tundra of northern Canada and and and played varmint tapes of dying baby
rabbits big wolves would come and they would kill you and eat you but if you
stood up and you know how to spear they'd run in fear
government
is being totally filled with criminals right now worldwide we got cancer we
gotta cut it out okay people don't be so negative it's not negative we got to do
something about this right now now I want to play this clip that we're going
to our guest this is a new clip backing up the earlier clip that was on the
local San Bernardino TV station where they say get the fire we're gonna burn
it down burn him down then we have the SWAT team actually with the tank saying
get ready to burn it down this is a third clip CBS News another clip where
they're running around in front of reporters who they hadn't run off yet
this isn't even on scanners who've got those you know shotgun mics that go out
a hundred yards with the cops going get the gas get the gas and that's why there
was fires earlier they tried to burn it down earlier then they got a tank up
there to do it gotta say they actually had some courage they're trying to kill
the cat ago get the gasoline up there themselves so here is the CBS clip I
mean it's open and shut they burn this thing now this is three clips now here
it is
all right again we apologize for the expletives this is live coverage a gun
battle we believe with Christopher Dorner going on right now in Big Bear
okay ladies and gentlemen the media last night this morning was calling it a
conspiracy theory just said that they burned it down now CNN is asking what
does the audio mean so we forced the dinosaur media again to cover something
now ladies and gentlemen I wanted to get him on last week but he was too busy to
join us we're thankful that he's here with us today he does happen to be a
sponsor but that's not why he's on the air with us Steve shank of the Jay
Michael Stevens group II foods direct calm I saw articles where they're not
letting people rebuild they're raising property taxes from Hurricane Sandy and
now with the Nemo storm people are still without power and government is trying
to harass them and using it as a power grab and how it ties into the Greek food
brawl that we're now seeing with hundreds and hundreds trying to battle
to get radishes and things that fell off a truck shades of Argentina and why is
the government gearing up for that here I have some articles breaking down all
of that today and I wanted to get Steve shank on to the end of the hour that I
promise we're going right to Mike Bobby Jason Carl and others and I want to hear
from police on their take of what's happened but first before we talk about
geopolitically what's going on with Steve shank as a philosopher educator
noted food expert and 30-plus year I mean the father of modern storeable
foods everybody else claims they're him he's the real deal everybody says that
about their sponsor go check it out they are the real deal
efoods direct calm forward slash Alex to find their free food deal where you can
get some samples and things in a food planning kit for free Steve's book it's
not your fault that delves into his philosophies a lot from and it goes on
and and Steve shank joins us here today Steve what is your take on Chris Dorner
and the police shooting up innocent people's cars that didn't even match it
and just government going crazy but the public going crazy too I mean it's like
half the people on YouTube and and I'm getting threats over this going hey kill
the pigs family kill kill kill kill Alex he doesn't want to kill the pigs I mean
the cops are turning into demons the people are turning into demons this is
like Sodom and Gomorrah what's going on here
well very simply we've talked about it and talked about it for years together
Alex and the fact is is that when people function from a position of fear you
cannot predict their behavior you have mob psychology which very simply is not
sane what has to happen now you know you you talk all the time about people
listening people getting the information people getting familiar with what's
going on and there's one step further that they have to take but unfortunately
you and I can't get them to do it on our own we can't fix anybody here's the law
for evil men to win all it takes is for good men to do nothing
having said that it doesn't do any good to have all of this information that you
and I have been disseminating for years and do nothing about it but if every
individual you know one of the most one of the most heart-rending messages that
I've ever gotten was after you and I were on a show together and that was
when a little gal emailed us and said you know what when you talked about
looking in the mirror every morning and say if it is to be is it up to me and if
every individual every American took responsibility for becoming independent
then the country would take care of itself if our people are not dependent
if they have enough food even if they don't have someplace to stay they can't
be in a situation where they have to be dependent like the Greeks those people
would not be rioting if every one of them had a year's supply of food for
their family in their homes they could stay in their homes and the the only
ones that would be rioting out there are the ones that are dependent and have to
go and say please somebody else take care of me the victims are the only ones
that are out there having problems you know one of the principles that you and
I've talked about several times is if you're prepared you can turn a disaster
into an adventure now I'm not saying that this thing was
dormer out there is a is a potential adventure but the mob psychology the
fear and the anxiety and the running hither and yon just decided to do
something shows lack of planning lack of preparedness there are going to be nuts
out there whether it's a cop killer like this or some idiot that walks into a
theater and start shooting people some of the folks are getting the message
that the best protection from crime and and other oppressive type of things that
we need to be fearful about is for each individual to be prepared to protect
themselves you can't depend on the police to protect you well Steve when
you came to town a few months ago incredibly popular newscast we did one
of the most downloaded and viewed on prison planet TV and on our YouTube
channel later you just pointed out they want to make us dependent and people are
finally getting 25 million on food stamps 50 million on food stamps shutting
down the power plants raising the taxes economy imploding they want us
domesticated you told the biblical story of economics and how all this works and
people are now getting it where they're throwing the book at people that have
lost their houses from sandy the government has finally gone over the
edge and become a bunch of paranoid and lunatics it's not like that in every
area of the country and Obama is now saying if Congress won't shut down all
the power plants I'm gonna do it I'm gonna bring in a carbon tax it's openly
testing to see if he can become a dictator I mean now is the time to get
prepared and we're just being proven right on this the last thing they want
is for us to be prepared so we better get prepared I mean it's we get made fun
of for being prepared but look at the government they're digging in like it's
the end of the world well the here's the law Alex you know it I know it and
everyone out there that thinks about it has to know this the extent to which you
as an individual are dependent is the extent to which you have become a victim
of your own choice and given power over yourself to that on which you depend if
you look in your cupboard or wherever you store your food and you don't see
enough food to feed your family for six months a year however long you think
it's going to take for us to recover from a total shutdown which is being
threatened if you look at that you can't blame anybody but yourself if you end up
like the Greeks out there having to riot to be fed if you're spending your time
rioting just to get food or out there begging or standing in bread lines how
effective can you be to be one of the good men who can do something if you
exactly and the IMF World Bank 112 point plan that got leaked in 2002 that we
covered in our big article yesterday how the globalists want riots and civil war
world worldwide not just here they say we shut things down then people riot
then that destroys confidence we use that to buy everything up then they
riot again they want a shut down society that's what you in agenda 21 is is it's
what we've got to buy local we've got to have gardens we've got to have sorble
foods we've got to have guns we've got to have our neighbors awake we've got to
control our counties in our cities this is the battle this is it and we need all
the bureaucrats to realize you're on our team whether you like it or not you're
not part of the New World Order you see what what has to happen is if each
individual or each family decides okay I am going to take care of me there is
nothing you can do to control what is said on the State of the Union address
you can do nothing as individuals to go out and try and change my daddy used to
say an interesting thing he says it's more difficult to change one stubborn
man's mind then to change the Congress of the United States well let's take
that further if our people stop being stubborn and stop choosing to be
dependent and say hey feed me feed the pigs feed the pigs remember the story
about the wild hogs and how you can capture them the fact is that if we
stubbornly refuse to be dependent as a look at all the Hollywood movies the
last 70 years making fun of the old timers that wouldn't take anything off
anybody it what they're the people that built this country they weren't stupid
they weren't backwards they weren't naive that's right and the and the fact
is that if you look in your in your cupboards and you don't have food there
and if something shuts down if these power plants go down on the grid gets
messed up or whatever happens and we know that something probably will happen
the fact that you're doing drills in every city with the police I have the
articles with links to video with people holding signs up saying I need food and
they're Americans I mean what are they getting ready for I don't know but I
guess maybe we can kind of guess the fact is that Eve if each individual
let's take a country that has everyone independent everyone can feed themselves
for a year everyone has guns if they if they feel like they need them you mean
the old you mean the old freer America the old freer America where every
individual takes care of themselves it what is the opportunity what is the
chance of anybody coming in and politically taking over unless you can
get a bunch of people to vote for you to take care of them that choose to be
dependent on you then you have total control the extent of which we're
dependent is the extent to which we give power over ourselves to that on which we
depend you see in any of these situations where we had shootings out
here in Utah one of the organizations provided a free class to teachers for
concealed weapon permits they had four hundred teachers come in and get their
permits to carry can see these ghouls go to the schools because they know it's
where they won't be resisted it's a gun-free zone it's a it's a free kill
zone every place that that that disallows the citizens to do what
Jefferson suggested that we do remember what he said the great object is that

out or arrest him that's that's a whole other can of worms right there in the
old days somebody was so dangerous and already killed a bunch of people it's
just not dead or alive dead just just kill him but then the government's so
corrupt it's not like it's some outlaw who's been known and seen at ten saloons
killing people and everybody knows you know red-bark or whatever it's just
we're told this is the guy and that's the official story and I've got
articles coming up we're all over the news they keep saying they found his
passport and driver's license here and there it's all pretty weird but it's a
big big big PR problem for the establishment and Obama so I don't see

in less debt per capita than we are and they've got riots all over two years
into this you know people homeless more and more homeless here I mean it really
is smart for people to get storeable foods and I guess that's the final
equation food is key show us water show our firearms you'll never stand in a
bread line if you have your own bread but other little tidbits and points
you'd like to add about what we're seeing unfold well just very very
quickly yeah yeah they were they were talking about this this testimony before
the Senate subcommittees and talking about how people need to protect their
homes and all that the message that people are afraid to announce is the
reason for the Second Amendment is not hunting not for us to protect ourselves
from other Americans very simply we had come from countries as immigrants that
that established this country where the government always overpowered the
population with armament and they determined that for this people to stay
free they had to maintain enough power in the hands of the people so that the
government couldn't overpower them with armament that's why the Second Amendment
is there nobody wants to say it they want to sugarcoat it by saying well we
need this for hunting well you don't need more than five rounds for honey and
why do we need these assault rifles and exactly what the founders said a
tyrannical government arming to the teeth while saying turn your guns in we
just want to be friends there you go enough of that we got to talk about an
interesting thing the people at this point what we're trying to do Alex is
tell everybody very simply like you've been telling them for years if you are
not independent if you don't have your own bread you will end up standing in a
bread line you do not want to be exposed to that what we're doing you announced
some some contact information for us what we've done is we've put together a
bunch of packages where people literally can supply themselves and there's enough
free stuff that goes along with it so they can supply their friends and
relatives and that type of let's talk about that back in seconds back in 60
seconds and then the whole next hour your phone calls
you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today you prepare by purchasing

waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
Alex Jones all right five minutes left with Steve
shank of the foods direct comm for slash Alex to get that food planner and free
six meals to test out their great products a great sponsor but it's it's
about getting you prepared as well it's a win-win finishing up and then we're
gonna come back with phone calls at eight hundred two five nine nine two
thirty one to know Bobby Mike and others been holding a while we'll go right to
your calls we start the next segment chef max as he was visited by the FBI
DHS that I was brought up we'll see what happened with that eight hundred two
five nine nine two three one your calls straight ahead but Steve what was the
point about some of the new offers you've got any foods direct comm for
slash Alex it's just simply the fact that the the one thing that people must
realize is if each family each individual takes care of themselves then
the country will take care of itself if you are independent and never have to to
go and riot and go and beg and become a victim then there isn't much that you
can happen and so what we've done is we've put together some packages where
people get oddly enough almost as much stuff free for their for their
shipments but the main thing that I got to say I don't want to make this into an
infomercial Alex you know that the fact is if people if good men don't act and
the way you act is you can't go out and change what's happening out there but
you can control what you do the way you act has become independent so you can
live to influence to help to support to work another day if we stop shopping
with globalist if we start shopping locally if we wake people up if we get
prepared that will wreck the New World Order it's that simple now tell me about
the new Patriot pack that you've got any foods direct calm forward slash Alex
well this very simply is just a wonderful piece of equipment that has
the stove and everything in it and also 72 servings of food but that comes free
with every $400 worth of food oddly enough if an individual orders in a one
year supply of the best food on the planet they get up to 20 of these things
that go along with it that they can share with their their family or they
can use for themselves that are just great grab and go with 72 servings in it
and I'm actually on the side at 76 and the free stove and some other stuff
these are these are great boogie packs infowars.com has links over to eat foods
direct calm forward slash Alex and again when you go there that's where all the
specials are give them a call 800 409 5 6 3 3 800 409 5 6 3 3 we're seeing
massive increases in inflation all over the world I've got a stack of that in my
news today you've been predicting this for about four or five years we've seen
food prices go up 50% on average what's happening now the only hope that people
have is to do two things first of all by getting their food supply in they freeze
the price at today's prices so it won't go up to the point where it will price
them out of the market right now 20,000 families or individuals that they are
dropping below the poverty level that means they don't have enough to buy
their own food let alone extra the other thing is by freezing the cost and
acquiring the food you also freeze the availability why do you think that this
food is going up so much we have where the last year a seven-year famine
worldwide food prices food is short we had a terrible crop this last year we're
going to have another terrible one this coming year what's happening is those
food prices are going to price themselves out of the market but the
availability for even people that have plenty of cash set aside or gold set
aside literally at some point in time out here in Utah they talk about at some
point in time we won't be able to buy a loaf of bread with a bushel of gold
we're getting there it just you have I hope things turn around politically and
people can you know get Congress to try to impeach there are things we can do
but it number one is get prepared eight hundred four oh nine five six three

the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show time
keeps on slipping into the future all right I haven't even gotten into the
state of the Union yet where Obama says if Congress doesn't do what I want I'll
just do it with executive power on carbon taxes you name it that's all
coming up there's now four clips actually different clips of official
scanners and news with police saying we're gonna burn that house down get the
gas and people are spinning it on CNN going they meant tear gas just like Waco
right where they set the fires and said tear gas did it I mean I predicted they'd
burn it down I mean just don't be so naive it's a religion of being naive I'm
gonna get into that everything look now let's go through your calls quickly here
I want to get to everybody at least five or six of these callers that are on
hold in this segment Bobby and Michael and Mike and Carl and Chef Max I want to
hear what he has to say I can't wait to hear this but right now let's go to
Bobby in California you won't talk about the state of the Union what you think of
that Obama Obama openly oh what do you say right now you're on the air sir
what's your take on that okay Obama openly announced that he bypassed
Congress and signed the executive order that enforces Homeland Security's role
as all-powerful king in charge of cyber security do you see that yes sir yes he
said he will bypass Congress as we predicted and have a cybersecurity bill
that even seen at news says his Chinese style or Russian style censorship and he
won't even let Congress see the cyber order he already did that already did it
warrant was wiretapping you name it and he said he'll bypass them on carbon
taxes he said he'll do it everything I mean it's happening it's happening and
the government is preparing for war with us they want a civil war
they're crazy Obama appointed Homeland Security civil liberties division to
oversee all Homeland Security to make sure they don't abuse our power well
that's right to get around states rights they create a ten-member governor board
he appoints who says it's all right to run over the states the governor's you
appointed said it was okay to take over all the rural areas under the Pentagon
we have a Rural Affairs Commission see we don't need the Bill of Rights
Constitution or courts anymore we have these new things that linen I mean
excuse me Obama has created and on the quick thing on the daughter thing I
remember on the frenzy yesterday I remember thinking just like if somebody
wanted to take out your whole family all they'd have to do is just make a
anonymous anonymous phone call to the LAPD and say that they saw Donna go in
your house and you know they didn't they come it wouldn't even be news or they
could kill people blame it on you have you dead in the house burn it down two
weeks later and say and again I don't think that's what happened but that's
the problem with burning down houses with people is you know his charred
body supposedly and they're very suspicious and oh I have two articles I
haven't gotten to yet let me show these thank you for the call sir if you're a
TV viewer check these out radio listeners go check them out for yourself
as well Dorner manhunt ex-cop may have had help
court record show LA Times and then in the article it says after authorities
not servants authorities interviewed the boat captain early Thursday they found
donors wallet identification cards at the San Yashiro port of entry if I'm
saying that right near the US Mexico Ysidro the same day I guard at the point
Loma Naval Base told authorities he had spotted a man matching donors
description trying to sneak onto the base according to court records I mean
folks you can have false alarms but I mean this is like 9-11 they found
multiple passports in the rubble that day that survived it I mean it turned
out it was made up and I mean this is really bizarre I don't want to say this
wasn't staged I mean it looks like it was real because it puts egg on their
face it is something they want to stage it's a PR black eye a disaster but at
the same time here's the other article donors wallet found in burned-out cabin
with his driver's license that's USA today this is getting so ridiculous and
they didn't know if he had hostages in that house in that cabin he'd had them
at the other house he'd been at earlier in the day a few miles away or was it 20
miles away I mean who knows there's such lying but they say they didn't burn it
down he has an accidental fire Dorner probably started at that's now on CNN as
we predicted I predict if they burn down his cabin it's like predicting that
grizzly bears have brown fur or the moon you know orbits the planet or the Sun
comes up in the morning I mean this is not hard okay I said I'd go to your
calls let's go to your calls Mike in Tennessee former military and police
wants to give his take on this Mike should we just have everybody in
Southern California line up and be shot that way the police are safe it looks
like it's that way doesn't it yeah unfortunately I can't say that's too far
from the truth is it no the behavior of these guys is actually becoming
nationwide as indicated to the fellow who answered the phone I told him that I'd
actually tried to work with the Miami police force shortly after actually got
back from you know serving a little bit of time in Iraq Afghanistan and some of
the other fun areas that our government likes to abuse and unfortunately Miami I
couldn't take the behavior it was identical this famous for like shooting
peaceful protesters with signs in the face with rubber bullets and then the
and then the captain laughing going I love how you shot that bleeping whore in
the face yeah exactly hey cops the government's gonna take everything you
got to when nobody has rights it means nobody has them go ahead I'm sorry no
that's okay and in my opinion I don't really condone the shooting of innocent
people and at the same time you can almost see how Dorner would be
frustrated about this behavior because still he's warped I mean you go shoot
somebody's daughter because they because because it was police brutality and then
they fired you over it because you blew the whistle I mean that's not equal
weights and measures is my point I mean you should never go after somebody's
family you should know I mean you're gonna go after somebody go after them
right exactly the thing is we might be being told the wrong thing also that
might be a setup to make him look bad you're right you never know that's why
there could be multiple ones you're right I I you know I tend to you know I
mean he's a big Obama supporter and all this other stuff and and we've gone back
and found records before this happened that he was a big Obama supporter and a
gun grabber so I've done a lot of research on it I'm about 90% this is
real but surely there they are trying to doll it up and do some things what kind
of stuff did you see with the Miami police force I literally saw the same
thing enormous amounts of racism in fact I've lost multiple friends who joined
them I don't want to say you know they didn't die or anything but I lost them
to personality changes where they were for example Hispanics themselves and
they start calling you know using the n-word using whatever racist slang you
could you could think of towards their own self I mean you know sort of their
own race towards you know black folks and it was amazing I couldn't even
associate with these people and just so you know I'm actually a former Green
Beret so this type of behavior is extremely offensive to me and there is a
gangsterism if you look at gang handbooks and gang psychology police
more and more are behaving like a giant street gang god bless you I appreciate
your call it's just terrible ladies and gentlemen and the TV just says worship
police no matter what they do that gives cover to the bad guys in the system that
are taken over you're not helping the police putting up with bad behavior
folks and we obsess on the police because as the police goes so goes the
nation okay if the police are taken over by the globalist and turned into these
crazy psychos it's gonna be a civil war and I'm the biggest friend of the police
ever because I don't want to see my bunch of you dead I mean if you guys are
hiding out because a dorner you start the gun confiscation I mean it's I've
done the math on it I know history I've studied it the cops will stand down
what's gonna happen but if the cops tried to engage the American people
every cop in America would be killed basically very quickly very quickly very
quickly you I mean it because there's again 1% stands up of gun owners that's
1.6 million combatants now you do the math being on the offense is so much
more powerful and if people go on the offense against the police they're all
dead ladies and gentlemen now I don't want to go there that's why I keep
talking about this let's talk to chef max chef max is in Texas tell us the
story of what happened to you well let me tell you brother I was at work just

yeah this is they hired Marcus wolf the former head of the Stasi died a few
years ago they hired him back in 2002 to about oh five I first heard this I didn't
believe it I went looked at the federal funding purchases it was like 1.1
million a year to pay him the former head of the Stasi to come here and help
set that up and it's an intimidation and and I've had Secret Service in FBI come
and say what do you mean about this I mean the Texas Ranger that was here
yesterday was here for 15 minutes I didn't get to talk to him as I was on
air they just told him to go and then he wouldn't come back is all we've got what
we need now he's like so what goes on around here I need to check this I only
believe mainstream media so I called him up and said the government's criminal
government ships in the drugs don't come around here acting like we're bad just
because you showed up you're wearing a cowboy hat let's see you get up there
and break a horse right now son I mean I'm tired of all this that I'm bad and
government's good that's what all this is about so I've been over there the
domain really nice movie theater Shane's taking his wife I've taken mine over
there you know if we watch Dinesh D'Souza's movie I think that was the
night he's talking about when I had a chance to meet the chef over there is
that really good gourmet food at that theater North Austin I need to go back
over there's not an ad for it so so starting over tell people what happened
okay so you're trying to help a TSA worker who part-time is a waitress that's
gonna be a pretty good gig over there the average waitress makes 19 bucks an
hour but she made me even more than that so she's over there and I guess we're
talking political I mean they just arrested a guy he's facing a felony for
peanut butter you know I mean they're crazy they want to put us all in camps
where they're slaves so tell us what happened well I really wanted to get a
mind the idea of the mindset of people that actually work there and you know
what she what she's driving for what her what her goals are but another part of
the what I asked her for was any kind of documents a handbook etc that you know
might give me another better idea what what goes on and I made the off comment
off the cuff comment hey I'll I'll give you a reward if you bring something in
that's what prompted them to come by it was the assumption that I was going to
bribe or you know pay for information yeah but see I wouldn't even have talked
to him because they'll spin everything against you or claim you lied about
something and try to put you in jail for that you know they put Martha Stewart in
jail not for insider trading but they said she lied she didn't do anything I've
looked at the case meanwhile the Congress is insider trading publicly I
mean I would just say hold on a minute I mean obviously hey I'll make you have a
nice pizza of you you know I want to understand the handbook you know like
art does the handbook say there's radiation we're trying to help them it's
a public service I don't like that stuff's quote classified about the
scanners so how did this end I'm like look I wasn't looking for classified
information I was looking for open information maybe from an insider
perspective and they said well you know since you weren't looking for quote
unquote classified information you know we're not going to pursue this any
further and you're clear but you know and then the conversation shifted to
well what do you think of Alex Jones so what are your you know what how do you
feel about is you know his point of view and etc oh my god very nice very nice
gentleman I gotta say but you know shifting the conversation back to you
asking you know what my my views were on the subject at that point I'm like look
guys you know it's all great points do I agree with everything he says you know
I'm an individual I create my own decisions based on the information I get
I would have said what do you think of Alex Jones I did one of the FBI agents
that he's a listener I'm like oh that's when I had the FBI here last time they
were asking what what what's that poster and I'm going it's Obama deception it's
a film it's been out for lucky you know I mean it doesn't even matter I mean
it's like this implication that I'm doing something wrong I mean and it's
just it's just not happening I'm sorry go ahead I went on the aggressive with
them I look I believe I'm a staunch supporter in the Second Amendment I
believe in the right of the people defend themselves from tyranny now look
at the both I'm like look you two will be civilians when you retire and then
you will want that right and that's the only thing keeping us from becoming any
other and what did they say at the end of that with the big evil chef at the
movie theater they agreed with me they go oh yeah I you know we're we're
supporters of the Second Amendment also I'm like I'm formerly the homeland
security guy was like I'm former or military so I was in so that you know
street clothes and I had my jacket on I had a guns and coffee logo patch with a
cup a a play on the Starbucks and we got into a story about you know Starbucks
not sending coffee over to the military servicemen and women over and overseas
we got a conversation about that holding back the tyranny is that most people in
the military and the police are still common sense and are good men and women
they're trying to warp them though right now and there's a battle right now going
on and look they're not gonna worry about when they get out of the of the
government and are quote civilians they're gonna have to worry now this is
all coming to a head the next few years okay I mean I mean there is no future
they plan to shut this country down and break us that is the official plan so
folks better decide where they stand so how did this end chef max it went well I
mean we parted ways or shook hands nothing was wrong and you know that's
what the investigation was over but I want to reiterate everybody finish one
point that I promise I'm going to the other callers but stay there and we go
to William today we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
all right I gotta get all these other callers the State of the Union so much
more looking like 15 stacks of news here no exaggeration it's all up at
www.prisonplanet.com and info wars.com we're here every weekday 12 noon at
3 p.m. Eastern info wars.com as I said is the website police audio from
Doran or siege burn this mother effort down all right we're gonna go ahead with
the plan with the burners and now there's more clips of the police saying
we're going to burn him down we're going to kill him get the gasoline and there
are people in the in the comments there's almost a thousand comments on
this one article who's linked up at drudgereport.com saying saying that oh
no it's just like Waco they mean tear gas rounds well yeah there's also
military tear gas that shoots flame out the sides it is well known for starting
fires but they've got a tank in there and they say place the burners okay
they're ignited okay there's a fire I mean it's all right pull building seven
we gave the order watch the building come down demolition term and they say
get back we're blowing it up I mean you cannot sit there and get me to not
understand what's happening chef max so the FBI visited because you had a
waitress who was also TSA and you said hey I want to find out if their manual
warns you about the radiation we really need to protect you and you know people
try to bring in your manual and the FBI comes to talk to you how does the story
end well they they basically say you know hey you know don't try and bribe
officials you know if you would have offered you know actually given her
money that have been we would have a case for pursuing this I said I you
know I totally understand you know that's not my that wasn't my goal and my
intentions you know just looking for intent is key you're like hey bring me
a manual they're telling you about radiation or not I'll give you a pizza
basically I think that was part of the conversation also I love taking care of
people and you know I know you've given me a free pizza you're nice everybody
needs to come up there but but but still you've got the FBI and Homeland Security
up there at your work you know high-class place it's it's it's all
part of I mean I can't believe though did she run and then talk about this to
them like she's secret agent it was a conversation was started at work her
supervisor got involved and then before you know I mean this took six months for
them to get to me you know it wasn't like they knocked on my door you know
the day after I had the conversation but still I mean I'm I'm a little person
with a view and a point of view and I still had two agents with I mean the big
salaries you know well I have the Texas Ranger here because you know Rob do you
broke the whole thing down for me well the security system records everything
and then that entrance so I wouldn't listen to it actually listen to him
must be technical I don't listen the whole thing on the time for 20-minute
tape but I was in the front the end the guy seemed pretty nice but he's still
like you know well I need to know who these Marines are that gave you this
info because we you know you know we don't think he's crazy either and we
want to make sure and then I call him back okay I'll talk to the Marines see
if they want to talk to you but I said do not give me a subpoena I'm gonna fight
it because I go you're not gonna be able to get that with freedom of the press I
know things are changing but he goes no no no I talked my supervisors you're
right Thank You mr. Jones I said what do you mean cuz we've already got to you
know you know the info you've given us from some other Marines but but your
article was helpful I gotta go my supervisor says you know hang up he hung
up on me won't answer the phone and I'm like I want to talk to the Texas Ranger
you know I wanna I want to hear what's going on I mean I want to know about I
want to interrogate him in a nice way about I don't buy this story that some
guy who was you know a mechanic and the Marines has PTSD and goes out and shoots
Chris Kyle and then it's an open-and-shut case and the stories change
so much good to hear from you chef max I should have clicked when I cuz I met the
guy twice really nice place folks I've been in movie theaters all over the
country there's swanky so I'm you know in a city or something and got an
evening I'll say oh where's the local movie theater we can eat dinner you know
that's kind of the the end thing the last decade or so with Alamo Drafthouse
I started here in Austin but they have other ones and I'll it's one of the
nicest or the nicest I've ever been to very very nice little plug there I get
my free tickets let's go to move quick here William says he works in
intelligence in Virginia William what's your take on the Dorner case is that
what you called in about multiple things sir I just I just want to take a second
to kind of explain because I listen to what you're saying you're absolutely
correct but it's almost like your viewers don't understand what's going
on and when you say it's an in for you're absolutely right but it's
multifaceted in the army we call this a basic flanking maneuver so the
distraction is the main attack right in your face the flanking maneuver to the
left or right what they're going behind the scenes so as the administration
text-to-text-to-text with executive orders or proposed legislation around to
the right side DHS is preparing for military action and it's very very
obvious but if people don't understand what they're seeing they won't understand it
yeah there's a giant arms buildup and now open admission they're preparing for
giant war in all 50 states with the people I mean this is so depressing so
horrible it means they're gonna totally collapse things and I want to stop it
man I live here I mean this is crazy this is crazy we've got the FBI visiting
chefs because they want to learn about the radiation manuals that if they're
admitting they're dangerous trying to help people federal employees meanwhile
the globalist are gutting the country I'm sorry go ahead make a point so the
second thing I wanted to get to was in the army we have a saying about the
planning for operations and it is no plan survives first contact so what you
have to understand is these guys are planning for two outcomes they can
slowly pick peccados until we just forfeit all right or they can push those
until we fire and that's what DHS is there for that's right people people
always say to me well which is it where's the martial law they're trying to
ease us into it but if it causes too much resistance they may go all the way
so you're right they've probably got five different plans running
simultaneously that run from soft takeover to hard takeover and that means
detonating nukes and saying the Patriots did it they've got five major plans for
my study and watching their pre programming see the programming tells
you where they're going with the public that's targeted towards unconscious
people you're conscious you see it that gives you information awareness of what
the battle plan is by the technotronic programming that's going on but I'm
sorry you've got the floor go ahead and make your points oh yes sir you're
absolutely right so it's just people need to understand that this is
absolutely real and just because you don't feed in your particular
neighborhood or area it doesn't mean it's not going on pay attention to the
news and always remember always remember everyone is more radical the legislation
and ideas come from the White House the distraction will become that much more
ridiculous think about it all these things going on Hollywood stars and the
shooter out in in California all these things to keep your attention on those
things that are not necessarily that important so that the plan can be pushed
forward you're saying Dornan may actually be staged no no sir I'm not
saying that he's what I'm saying is if you notice there was national attention
they decide to get attention that becomes the diversion yeah absolutely
absolutely let me ask you this because it's now in the army time stars and
stripes urban warfare drills I mean it's admitted they're preparing for total
civil unrest takeover of the states that's all actually on the books public
it's just the general public doesn't look it up so it becomes a rumor you
know it's kind of like I hear there's a place called the South Pole called the
Antarctic but I never saw it so it's a rumor no no it's down there okay and so
it's the same thing like I heard there's a Niagara Falls but I ain't never saw it
you know before there was television and stuff people had to go off what they
were told or so it's the same thing but for people in quote intelligence I'd
guess if you're in Virginia it's probably military something but I don't
know I mean are they freaking out over the fact that it's now always been
hidden they're preparing for domestic war for about 20 years now they're
uncloaking and accelerating the programming which means they're getting
ready to go hot or at least looking at going hot I mean are people realizing
what this means some of them are sir but you also have to remember the beltway
it's kind of immune to everything else going outside of that area it's in a
bubble like Hitler's bunker absolutely so people here aren't really filling the
financial crunch to everyone everywhere else's some people are living in a dream
I work with some people who are completely aware what's going on but at
the same time they say I have to make a paycheck a pool my table I gotta pay my
house mortgage and I keep telling them well if you don't speak out against this
you may not have a house to pay for you know you may not have a table to put
food on see that's what scary is is is that the programs work from
deindustrialization hardcore depression reorganization breaking of the American
people on the on the light end to absolute Mao Zedong kill half America
level crap and I've studied history so much folks I'm not saying that to scare
you they're leaning towards Mao Zedong level stuff so once the gloves come off
folks it's just gonna be hell on earth and I hope everybody understands they
were warned go ahead yes sir and from my military experience I was in solution I
was there and I saw that you know we were almost no holds bar there and I'm
telling people you they need to listen and from my personal experience my
personal opinion I believe that the main plan is to prepare for a military
conflict within the United States of America DHS is openly ordering all these
things you would need for an open conflict and people I'm telling a long
war a long war where they're gonna be forced into certain regions I mean they
plan a full-out long war and mr. Jones the only issue I've ever had for you had
to have against you and this is the I've been looking for a long time is that you
hesitate to tell people how bad things will get and it's because you don't want
to scare people understand that but people need to hear it people understand
how quickly you know their area can be cordoned off and forces can come in and
blow through houses so fast they don't know what hit them they don't understand
it you know their water and power can be shut off to a specific area and though
you can be wait it out and the issue is at first they're gonna wipe people out
put out PR on them to demonize them but then I know what's gonna happen the
veterans and people are not that they're scared they're just been waiting they're
gonna go completely ape against anybody in the government I mean from your
research what do you think's gonna happen to people in the military and
police once the Civil War kicks off I think a lot of you growing people will
pick a side which also have to understand that as many arms as we may
have on the civilian side and I own weapons on support of the Second
Amendment you also have to remember during the invasion of Iraq you had
Iraqis who believed because they were told by Saddam Hussein that if they put
plastic wrap over RPGs they could destroy the Abrams invisible force field
okay not that Americans believe things like that but if you think about what we
will go up against okay all the donor gun owners there are in America we don't
make a difference against an Abrams or Bradley's or strikers or UAVs with
health fire well what's gonna happen is but I mean but still they couldn't hold
all of Baghdad what you're saying is true but it's the issue is it's gonna be
like donors it's going to be people where they go out get one person and
then never do anything again I mean it's it's it's I've studied the history of
total resistance it's just gonna be horrible I just want to not have this
happen I just want to have America wake up the problem is is that it looks like
the system is just hammer down and if if libertarians and constitutionalists and
conservatives and liberals don't wake up and say no to this tyranny it's over god
bless you I appreciate your call anything else you want to add William
yeah just real quick the whole donor thing people don't need to understand
that that episode revealed the weakness and the lie behind terrorism in the
United States of America one guy a reservist in the Navy he doesn't get
specialized training like the Army or the Marine Corps he took very basic CI
training and he almost defeated the LAPD the FBI the marshals and they had
reapers or drones out there looking for him this will tell you if they were ever
real terrorists in America we could not stop them we had all the assets we could
have but that's what I'm saying if it goes to civil war the veterans are gonna
go asymmetrical and there's gonna be no way to stop them because they're not
gonna be popping up for the predator to get them it's gonna be a bunch of
off-duty cops are at a bar and you know what happens I mean it's just and then
that's what they're preparing for they're training police for five years
you will face veterans with IEDs well you're going to kill veterans families
before they come after you and they are they're planning to try to come arrest
everybody I mean they're gonna force us into a civil war to wipe us all out
that's the goal we've got to get that word out and stop it god bless you I
appreciate the call but I just can't believe we're talking like this on air
and the thing is I know I'm right I know that's where it's going and now it's all
materializing but let me tell you why they could win they'll nuke a city or
something they'll go that bad or say Patriots released a bio weapon and have
the guy captured and have him confess to it and they'll use you know 20 million
dead from some horrible mousepox as the thing of it was the gun owners that did
it I mean folks you gotta understand they're confident for a reason they got
nasty stuff up their sleeve and it's not our military it's a foreign global
technocracy that's what they call it themselves a technotronic technocracy of
scientific masterminds programming the US military and government programming
us for self-destruction shutting everything down dumbing down the family
injecting our troops with cancer virus shots I mean it's just it's total war
the US is under attack this is a foreign New World Order takeover what you're
saying people say well why are you still alive because they don't want to kill me
because then that would add credibility to what I've done they don't want to
martyr me yet okay and I'm not looking to die I don't want to die but I mean
you know what I'm not worried about it folks because I know how real this is I
want to beat these people man I want the good guys to win I don't I've studied
this so I know how they work so we can beat them and you know I've talked to
generals and people retired generals famous ones current people and you talk
to them and they go wow how do you know this I never thought of that they're not
even that something they're not smart they've never been uncompartmentalized
and I don't know I can't believe I know more than most people I just even in the
government I'm not that special folks it's not a good feeling to know more
than almost anybody else I mean I know what the globalists at the
top know but I'm not with them I've reverse engineered their whole program
and I've confirmed my analysis through their actions and I'm just like oh my
god oh my god we've got to warn people please God heal this country I mean I
pray hard ladies and gentlemen I pray hard I mean this is this is the calm
before the storm as crazy as things are okay let's go to Andre in Florida I'm
gonna go to Michael and Michael's first Michael is a former marine on the on the
Dorner subject go ahead sir yeah hi when I first when I first heard about this
whole thing the first thing I thought about was Gordon call and Ruby Ridge and
Waco Texas yeah they burned out Gordon call Ruby Ridge Waco all of them yeah so

had to talk to you because see I'm a Roman Catholic layman who is an
exorcist and I've used exorcism against since 1990 senators and representatives

on you until you break I told the staffs that and none of them chose to call me
back when they were Democrat Republican conservative liberal whatever Catholic
Don Catholic and I did and they all lost their next election period I can this
anytime Wow send me a letter it's very interesting I know this you is a psych
warfare thing these people most of them are occultists if you do tell them you're
doing rituals against them it'll freak them out see they're all just used to

portal there's already water spraying in the government's like open it all the
way it's gonna be nice and I'm saying no it's not that last fella I was gonna
talk to hung up but let's go to callers quickly Carl and Oregon you're on the
air thanks for holding you're a trooper hello Alex good to talk to you again I
have a friend in the fire department who works closely with the San Bernardino
County Sheriff and this is called operation torque bad guy that's what
this whole operation is about well I mean we got like four different tapes of
them saying we're gonna burn him down and kill him we're gonna kill we're
gonna burn down the house people like they don't mean burn down the house
CNN's like burn down the house is code for ice cream cones so what did your
source tell you they don't want this individual to be able to get his story
out don't want them to be some type of a folk hero be able to write a book and be
able to expose anything that could perhaps bring down their credibility
well of course so they burned him up exactly yeah my friends work with them
for years and that that's that's just normal protocol when you have a
situation like that but a cop killer that's out there taking out one of
their own you know all you know all bets off you know I wish the police would act
like this when citizens got killed oh yes yes but there's you know it's a
brotherhood got understanding mentality it's a brotherhood among among each
other there's a camaraderie that they you know if somebody that goes rogue in
their system they're gonna have to cover this up immediately so that way nothing
can go sideways on them no but they're so arrogant now with the cover-ups that
they're all on the radio saying we're gonna burn it up and kill him and now
they're going Oh burn down the house is code for something else they're actually
saying that it's called it you know it's called wearing the house and then they
cordoned him up and then they took him out he shot himself I don't know yeah
they told the news cut the feed and I said oh looks like they're gonna burn
him up and they burn him up be like well you've got four tapes of them saying
they were gonna burn him up and burn down the house but that means something
different conspiracy theorist you know it's like if you saw an elephant you're
living and that's not an elephant that's a gray mouse you're like well it's
gigantic you're not a crazy person are you good to hear from you Carl Chris in
Missouri you're on the air go ahead military your take on this my take on
this is actually pretty simple I served overseas and in both theaters and I've
thrown flashbangs and all types of shit in all types of rooms and I'm an
active-duty armed service member and I'm actually in a combat MOS which means I
don't clean laundry or or work in a supply room or anything like that I go
outside the wire and I actively look for roadside boxes what we do and in doing
this a lot of times we actually raid homes and we'll throw flashbangs in I've
done flashbangs in rooms full of HME homemade explosives and nothing's
happened people hit the deck they drop they cover their heads that's that's
pretty unstable so I don't see how you can throw a flashbang in a room and
cause rounds to cook off and it's actually obviously they're like oh the
flashbang has the rounds cooking off well okay it's on tape we said burn the
mother effer down but that doesn't mean burn the burn the mother effing house
down doesn't mean burn the house down now yeah I understand completely and and
I want to touch on something else to you was talking about a lot of the urban
warfare that's going on or the training that goes on at the mouth training which
is really a big part of what we do combat an urban terrain oh yes are you
trying to fight the American people I'm not gonna say that but what I will say
is in the beginning when I joined in 2005 when we went to our mouth sites
that's our training sites they were mock mock parts of the city like mock parts
of the crit or Baghdad or Kirkuk and that was in the beginning and when you
raided a building you walked into a building that pretty much looked like a
mud hut but great because those cinder blocks because they want to be
cost-efficient well now a lot of our training areas you go to it looks like
downtown USA yeah I know I mean you're just now you're compartmentalized at the
higher levels is declassified it's for the American people it's public
incredible info wars calm the latest news folks will cover more tomorrow
