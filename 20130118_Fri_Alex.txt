[00:47.320 --> 00:52.360]  as doctor Dr. Andrew Wakefield who of course has been vilified for revealing
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.920]  the dangers of vaccines and coming up shortly CNN can't get him but we can
[00:57.920 --> 01:02.880]  it's the controversial Florida professor who's basically been savaged by
[01:02.880 --> 01:07.040]  mainstream media for questioning the official narrative behind the sandy hook
[01:07.040 --> 01:12.040]  shooting his profession professor James Tracy and he'll be live via Skype to
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.200]  take your calls and of course if you've been living under a rock for the past few
[01:17.200 --> 01:22.640]  weeks then the internet is basically a flame with what they're calling sandy
[01:22.640 --> 01:27.800]  hook truthers and there's actually one YouTube video alone which has got over
[01:27.800 --> 01:35.320]  10.6 10.6 million views in the last 10 days alone that talks about some of
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.640]  these questions surrounding the sandy hook massacre so basically he's been
[01:40.640 --> 01:58.640]  absolutely billed by the mainstream media I'm sorry sorry about that he's been
[01:58.640 --> 02:04.600]  absolutely billed by the mainstream media he was on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.400]  last Friday I believe it was and for 25 minutes Anderson Cooper attacked him
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.840]  put his picture up on screen basically it was a surprise that there wasn't a
[02:14.840 --> 02:20.360]  wanted sign next to his name I don't actually believe in all these theories
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.000]  that are circulating about sandy hook but we're going to talk to the professor
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.600]  before the bottom of the hour we're going to go over some of the questions
[02:28.600 --> 02:34.240]  that he and others have raised about the sandy hook massacre and about the
[02:34.240 --> 02:39.520]  backlash that he's faced from the likes of CNN from the likes of Fox News so
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.640]  that's going to be a fascinating talk we're also going to go to your calls at
[02:43.640 --> 02:50.160]  the top of the hour for professor James Tracy on all things sandy hook but the
[02:50.160 --> 02:55.520]  top news at the moment I'm for Wars comm and prison planet comm we've heard
[02:55.520 --> 02:59.640]  about the nerf gun we've heard about the kid you know being suspended for making
[02:59.640 --> 03:05.640]  a gun sign with his hand but this one really takes the biscuit and this took
[03:05.640 --> 03:10.560]  place in Mount Carmel Florida this is a story just out today basically a five
[03:10.560 --> 03:16.400]  year old girl a kindergarten girl had a toy pink gun it was a hello kitty toy
[03:16.400 --> 03:20.720]  pink gun that blew bubbles out of the gun when you pulled the trigger it's a
[03:20.720 --> 03:26.320]  toy gun for a kindergarten child she joked with her classmates that she was
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.240]  going to shoot them with her toy pink bubble gun and of course the teacher
[03:31.240 --> 03:35.840]  later finds out in this school in Florida the five-year-old girl is
[03:35.840 --> 03:42.320]  interrogated without her mother being present for three hours by school
[03:42.320 --> 03:50.720]  officials over a hello kitty pink toy bubble gun and it gets worse the girl
[03:50.720 --> 03:55.960]  told her mother that school officials actually threatened her with jail time
[03:55.960 --> 04:02.600]  this is a five-year-old girl jail time for making jokes about shooting people
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.960]  with a pink bubble gun and she was actually suspended this five-year-old
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.040]  child was suspended from kindergarten and get this school officials as well in
[04:14.040 --> 04:20.640]  this story said that she was making terroristic threats terroristic threats
[04:20.640 --> 04:27.440]  with the toy pink bubble gun the hello kitty gun so I mean this again just
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.120]  heaps on top of the craziness in the aftermath of sandy hug is it really any

[08:15.000 --> 08:23.200]  Tracy to talk about the Sandy Hook controversy but now we're joined on the
[08:23.200 --> 08:28.360]  line by Alex Jones with an emergency alert for gun owners Alex welcome to the
[08:28.360 --> 08:34.480]  show that's right I've taken a day off to take my son camping and I got up this
[08:34.480 --> 08:40.080]  morning and began reading the articles at info wars.com I had to call in here to
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.680]  point out that even info wars.com and even myself and my great researchers we
[08:45.680 --> 08:51.400]  tend to under or downplay the full magnitude of this what's happening is
[08:51.400 --> 08:59.120]  so tyrannical and so sensational in how over the top it is the globalists have a
[08:59.120 --> 09:03.000]  good chance of actually getting most of our guns that we don't completely wake
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  up what am I talking about there are two key articles right now info wars.com
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.960]  what about big sis to use to see something say something Homeland Security
[09:13.960 --> 09:19.240]  spy grid on gun owners the other and I saw other articles yesterday about police
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.480]  drills federally funded to take on disgruntled veterans and gun owners
[09:23.480 --> 09:26.760]  now regular listeners know this is nothing new you know the New York Times
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.360]  four years ago three years ago scouts trained to take on terrorists and more
[09:30.360 --> 09:33.920]  as they trained to take guns and kill veterans and the Homeland Security
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.040]  documents saying returning veterans of the number one enemy gun owners
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.440]  conservatives libertarians constitutionalist longfall in the
[09:40.440 --> 09:46.680]  fetters we've known this was behind the scenes in the documents for at least the
[09:46.680 --> 09:50.680]  last four years it was going on before that but it accelerated under Obama now
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.080]  I've had a chance yesterday and last time this morning to read the executive
[09:55.080 --> 09:59.360]  order to really drill into it and it confirms everything they tried to push
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.320]  before all at once hitting us from over a hundred angles 23 executive orders a
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.440]  bunch of legislation a bunch of other actions they are creating well they've
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.520]  created the Giants tozzi spy force in the name of fighting al-qaeda now they
[10:14.520 --> 10:17.560]  don't worry about al-qaeda they're actually good guys our government
[10:17.560 --> 10:21.800]  using them and living in Syria back in the news and they're flipping the whole
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.440]  thing now people remember articles we wrote years ago saying white al-qaeda
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.160]  will be announced because we got the new training manuals and we saw the new
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.480]  training videos where every terrorist is a white person being quote reported by
[10:34.480 --> 10:39.200]  a minority and now the initial scripts are out on four new TV shows
[10:39.200 --> 10:45.160]  founding fathers and others where it's all white racist with guns and minorities
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.640]  taking them down so it's a government organized attempt to push a kind of race
[10:49.640 --> 10:54.240]  war type deal where it's the minorities in the government teamed up against quote
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.880]  whites and that's why you see them on Fox Sports saying all gun owners are
[10:58.880 --> 11:03.960]  racist Klan members that's why you see Bob Schaefer on CBS saying we've got to
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.840]  have a World War two operation against gun owners like their Hitler folks you
[11:08.840 --> 11:12.560]  heard the clip that's why you're hearing that we murdered the children in
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.920]  Sandy Hook this is a purge of libertarians and conservatives I'm not
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.160]  saying this for a fact the evidence is incontrovertible it is an over-the-top
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.680]  situation they are definitely gonna stage false flags and come after us how
[11:26.680 --> 11:30.800]  did this was happening last year when four TV shows were in development all
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.040]  green-lighted down to just to start airing this year where gun owners are
[11:36.040 --> 11:40.280]  racist murderers so they're now gonna say gun owning is a white thing and
[11:40.280 --> 11:43.160]  people say well that doesn't make any sense they don't care this is how
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.120]  communists have taken down other countries and the banks are using the
[11:48.120 --> 11:51.520]  communist playbook it doesn't mean they're communist they use communism at
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.440]  the grassroots with fascism on top of it so you know I saw Steve Watson's article
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.760]  I saw Kurt Nemo's article I saw him and they're they're good articles but they
[12:00.760 --> 12:06.600]  don't they don't explain folks it's now happening everything we warned about
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.520]  everything we talked about now it's not going to be the TSA is going to be on
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.640]  the highways to stop Al Qaeda it's now going to be and it's already started
[12:15.640 --> 12:19.520]  gun checkpoint it's going to be harassment of gun owners it's going to be
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.600]  staying warm mentally ill they're already doing this they're already now
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.400]  have new gun questionnaires coming out of the state levels that say are you a
[12:27.400 --> 12:31.120]  conspiracy theorist do you believe in a new world order you can't have a gun and
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.320]  if conservatives give in to this and go I better just cut up or it'll take my
[12:35.320 --> 12:39.680]  guns now they have the chilling effect this is what authoritarian's have always
[12:39.680 --> 12:43.240]  done notice the world government's not denied now it's admitted and they're
[12:43.240 --> 12:47.400]  saying you're a terrorist if you don't accept it the mainstream medium the
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.520]  government all of it is an occupying force we still have talk radio we still
[12:52.520 --> 12:56.720]  have a lot of the states people are fighting back but Paul it is so over
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.880]  the top so over the top and I'm standing on top of Mesa I hope I'm coming
[13:01.880 --> 13:06.600]  through to you clearly I'm up here hiking can you hear me Paul yeah loud and
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.600]  clear okay good good I climb on top of mountain literally a small mountain
[13:10.600 --> 13:14.880]  to get fell range there's no fell out here where I'm at the hiking with my
[13:14.880 --> 13:20.240]  family so this is what it comes down to ladies and gentlemen is that we are in
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.840]  deep deep deep deep deep emergency trouble everything we talked about is
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.400]  coming true I'm not happy about that I'm not happy now that people all over the
[13:30.400 --> 13:33.820]  country saying Alex Jones is the leader of the resistance Alex Jones this and
[13:33.820 --> 13:38.000]  that but I am happy that we at least got the word out beforehand so we've got a
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.120]  chance to beat these people but I'm not happy it got this far this is not fun
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.120]  this is real folks this is real and a mainline conservative talk show host
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.240]  won't realize how much trouble we're in and get hardcore now it's over notice
[13:52.240 --> 13:55.520]  they preconditioned us before all this happened there's no world government
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.440]  nobody wants your guns the Federal Reserve isn't private oh none of this is
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.120]  going to happen there won't be any carbon taxes and now they're just doing it
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.520]  all it is now all happening in math I'm gonna let you get back to the broadcast
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.440]  the good news is as you pointed out there's more than 30 million views 10
[14:12.440 --> 14:16.880]  million on one video alone on YouTube about Sandy Hook hoax I haven't even
[14:16.880 --> 14:20.800]  gotten into the hook I think it smells to high heaven I don't know how deep it
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.400]  goes I know they stage the Batman saying even Larry Pratt says it has evidence
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.880]  that we know they stage fast and furious they could stage anything put nothing
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.280]  past them but the fact that and that's conservative when I say 30 million views
[14:33.280 --> 14:37.120]  and one video it's got like 11 million one's got 10 million I'm just in fact in
[14:37.120 --> 14:40.000]  fact the only time I lie is I underestimate because I don't want to say
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.920]  the truth it's like a hundred million views from what I've seen okay I said
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.360]  30 that was wrong okay it's like a hundred million views of people saying
[14:48.360 --> 14:53.640]  they don't buy Sandy Hook the media is panicking no one believes them anymore
[14:53.640 --> 14:56.640]  that's why they're moving they're not trying to take over because they're
[14:56.640 --> 15:00.560]  strong they're trying to take over because they are weak they're trying to
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.080]  take over because they know the people are waking up so black white Hispanic
[15:05.080 --> 15:11.280]  old young north south east west we have been taken over Obama got the taxes
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.640]  raised on poor people Obama promised not to come after the gun Obama promised
[15:15.640 --> 15:19.120]  all this stuff the Republicans are going to go along with total open borders to
[15:19.120 --> 15:23.000]  gut the country everything's about to happen this year that's why they're
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.720]  trying to mobilize their minions and dumb down soccer moms to go after our
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.120]  guns we have to get back in their face and say how dare you compare gun owners
[15:32.120 --> 15:35.600]  to Nazi Germany and the government has to have a war against them how dare you
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.040]  call us clan how dare you say we're criminals how dare you say we killed
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.000]  those kids how dare you try to put that guilt on us they are branding us here's
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.720]  the key I'm gonna get off we are being branded as the terrorists right now we
[15:48.720 --> 15:53.680]  are being branded we are being branded we are being branded the secret program
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.960]  but I discovered years ago that we forced out to go public from our law
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.600]  enforcement sources that are patriots is now going public they are going ahead
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.400]  with saying gun owners and conservatives are terrorists and then we're not going
[16:08.400 --> 16:13.200]  to be able to own guns this is a Soviet style purge like the reds did to the
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.600]  white Russians in 1917 ladies and gentlemen they are declaring a concerted
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.560]  homeland security program of harassment and intimidation against gun owners
[16:22.560 --> 16:28.160]  Obama must be impeached now he is an absolute criminal and you must call
[16:28.160 --> 16:31.000]  every member of Congress and let them know that you're fully aware of what's
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.080]  happening because they know they've all committed crimes and insider trading they
[16:35.080 --> 16:37.640]  know that they're bringing the country down they know they're imploding the
[16:37.640 --> 16:40.880]  derivatives they know they brought in the New World Order they know they've done
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.280]  all of this and so they want to lock us up the opposition to their criminal
[16:45.280 --> 16:48.280]  activities they want to say that real Americans know what's happening or
[16:48.280 --> 16:53.840]  terrorists this is so outrageous we have to use their their their their leap

[17:42.600 --> 17:48.640]  this is outrageous they are now branding us as terrorists worldwide we are being
[17:48.640 --> 17:52.960]  branded to be hunted down and arrested all watching the magnitude of this is
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.840]  literally off the charts what do you say well it's down and creepy isn't it
[17:57.840 --> 18:01.440]  because everybody's been asking well if they get the assault weapons ban through
[18:01.440 --> 18:05.240]  how are they gonna enforce it how are they gonna confiscate these weapons and
[18:05.240 --> 18:12.920]  big sis DHS has announced that they're gonna expand and prioritize the see
[18:12.920 --> 18:17.480]  something say some something campaign with the express purpose of aiding
[18:17.480 --> 18:22.960]  Obama's gun control so what does that mean it was I'm gonna get off and let
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.000]  you continue with the article we to repost Kurt Nemo's article where the
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.160]  bill was introduced where they make you turn your guns in and you get a tax
[18:29.160 --> 18:34.040]  credit for on your taxes folks it's happening she's announcing that we're
[18:34.040 --> 18:38.720]  the terrorist in the training videos every single person is white I mean

[19:16.160 --> 19:21.800]  not forget that Paul a report last year funded a report that said Americans
[19:21.800 --> 19:26.960]  quote reverential of liberty and Americans suspicious of centralized
[19:26.960 --> 19:32.160]  authority were basically terrorists they lumped them in with a bunch of hate
[19:32.160 --> 19:37.280]  groups racist clan members and terrorist organizations and said that
[19:37.280 --> 19:41.520]  Americans who held those viewpoints were in the same league I mean this is an
[19:41.520 --> 19:46.200]  agency that's put out PSAs for the past three or four years whereas Alex said
[19:46.200 --> 19:51.160]  every terrorist portrayed as white middle-class American that's who they're
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.640]  targeting and we'll be back after the break with professor James Tracy stay

[24:09.880 --> 24:21.520]  Alex Jones Mike Adams coming up in the second half of the show top story on
[24:21.520 --> 24:26.320]  Drudge report right now TSA to remove controversial x-ray scanners this is out
[24:26.320 --> 24:30.520]  the associated press transportation security administration confirms that
[24:30.520 --> 24:34.840]  it is getting rid of airport body scanners that produce a naked image of
[24:34.840 --> 24:39.000]  travelers so that's kind of a partial victory of course they're still going to
[24:39.000 --> 24:45.520]  use the ones that quote unzip your DNA but apparently now completely phasing
[24:45.520 --> 24:50.560]  out the x-ray body scanners of course as a result of numerous controversies over
[24:50.560 --> 24:56.200]  the past several years led in no small part by drudge report dot com and info
[24:56.200 --> 25:00.680]  wars dot com so that is a victory on that front because before the break you
[25:00.680 --> 25:05.440]  heard Alex he was talking about this new report out of Portsmouth Ohio which is
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.840]  up on info wars dot com drill characterizes disgruntled second
[25:09.840 --> 25:15.560]  amendment advocates as terrorists and basically they had a safety security
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.080]  exercise involving the police national guard and local emergency responders
[25:20.080 --> 25:25.560]  there in Portsmouth Ohio and the terrorists in this drill were portrayed as
[25:25.560 --> 25:29.560]  quote to school employees who are disgruntled over the government's
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.960]  interpretation of the second amendment and in this scenario they had these
[25:34.960 --> 25:42.800]  pro-gun rights people building weapons of mass destruction killing teachers and
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.440]  using you know biological agents against the local community so they're
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.320]  basically going full lockstep now demonizing second amendment advocates
[25:52.320 --> 25:58.200]  amidst this national debate on gun control so that story is up right now
[25:58.200 --> 26:04.640]  info wars dot com I'm delighted to be joined now by Professor James Tracy PhD
[26:04.640 --> 26:10.240]  from Florida Atlantic University he's a tenured communications professor and
[26:10.240 --> 26:15.840]  he also teaches a class entitled culture of conspiracy he's also involved
[26:15.840 --> 26:22.160]  with project censored and his website is memory whole blog com professor welcome
[26:22.160 --> 26:28.080]  to the show it's great to be here Paul thank you now before we get into Sandy
[26:28.080 --> 26:32.000]  Hook obviously we're gonna go in detail on that I want to talk about the
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  basically the onslaught you've received over the past week by the mainstream
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.520]  medium particularly CNN as I mentioned earlier Anderson Cooper literally
[26:41.520 --> 26:46.280]  devoted half of his show last week to attacking professor Tracy and then he
[26:46.280 --> 26:51.600]  had another ten-minute segment just a couple of days ago doing the same thing
[26:51.600 --> 26:57.160]  basically as far as I saw he was trying to get professor Tracy fired from his
[26:57.160 --> 27:02.680]  position there at the university so professor I mean CNN could have easily
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.880]  just ignored all this why do you think they've attacked you so vigorously for
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.320]  asking questions about Sandy Hook I think basically to bring me into the to the
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.320]  news frame and the personalized this between myself and the families of
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.120]  Newtown it has nothing to do with that I was bringing up questions that were not
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.800]  raised that were not addressed by the media Anderson Cooper is someone who
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.240]  says he's keeping them honest well who's he keeping honest the poor parents
[27:27.240 --> 27:30.560]  about their griefers he keeping people honest the authorities and so forth
[27:30.560 --> 27:34.000]  there but have dropped the ball with regard to the investigation or perhaps
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.040]  even covered something up they contacted me last Friday I was frankly somewhat
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.040]  exhausted from the entire week after this the story went viral drudge picked
[27:46.040 --> 27:52.000]  it up on Tuesday and I spoke with my family members and my wife and she
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  didn't really want me to to go on the show and so I declined from doing so
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.720]  and they were very persistent they in fact actually sent their reporter out
[28:01.720 --> 28:06.320]  here who went to my place of employment then filmed out my in my front lawn
[28:06.320 --> 28:11.040]  pretty much I was not even aware of that but he did call and say that he was
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.480]  around the around the corner he was a couple blocks away I guess wanted me to
[28:14.480 --> 28:19.600]  come out and I said look it I'm really not into it I'm tired I will consider it
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.480]  in the future I will I will provide a statement to you I provided an email
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.080]  statement took me an hour or so to compose they used a snippet of it or
[28:29.080 --> 28:33.800]  two on the air and that was it but other than that it was really in an attack I
[28:33.800 --> 28:39.760]  was I was really rather taken aback by the by the extent of it they contacted
[28:39.760 --> 28:45.280]  me again earlier this week and on Monday I said well I will consider it on
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.160]  Tuesday they said well it's time do you want to go ahead and do it and they
[28:50.160 --> 28:53.480]  wanted to get me down to the studio right away and I said I've got to teach
[28:53.480 --> 28:57.480]  this evening I really don't have the time but I will consider doing it I've
[28:57.480 --> 29:02.840]  contacted them again and they've not responded so you're perfectly willing to
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.240]  go on there you've contacted them and now they've basically stopped talking to you
[29:07.240 --> 29:13.000]  is that the case that's the case yes so maybe you know maybe they've dropped the
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  story I mean to my I watched the clip the 20-minute thing where Cooper's
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.840]  demonizing you and it seems obviously he's using you know you're insulting the
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.480]  victims as it is platform for what he's saying but he also seemed just as annoyed
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.920]  about the fact that you were questioning whether or not the mainstream media did
[29:30.920 --> 29:34.320]  its job in the first days after the event so we'll go more into that we'll
[29:34.320 --> 29:38.520]  talk about Sandy Hook after the break stay tuned this is the Alex Jones show

[33:26.600 --> 33:32.000]  caused no end of controversy over the past week because he's been heavily
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  demonized by the likes of CNN and Fox News. There's a video on YouTube which
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.320]  came to my attention about a week ago it's only been posted for about 10, 11

[33:49.520 --> 33:54.960]  have watched this video in the space of the last 10, 11 days alone that shows
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.160]  you how voracious the interest is in this whole Sandy Hook issue and I mean I'm
[34:00.160 --> 34:04.360]  coming at it from a perspective of there are lots of unanswered questions I
[34:04.360 --> 34:10.040]  don't buy into the notion that this never happened or that the parents the
[34:10.040 --> 34:14.320]  family members involved were actors in some sense which some people have
[34:14.320 --> 34:19.560]  claimed I think it was a real tragedy it really happened but there are plenty of
[34:19.560 --> 34:25.560]  unanswered questions that go along with it suggest more people than the accused
[34:25.560 --> 34:29.160]  shooter Adam Lanza may have been involved so we're gonna get into that now
[34:29.160 --> 34:35.200]  with professor James Tracy. So professor you know the Obama administration has
[34:35.200 --> 34:41.240]  built its entire gun control move on the notion that Adam Lanza shot these
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.000]  children with an AR-15 assault rifle they're trying to ban the assault
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.080]  rifles now given that wouldn't wouldn't it be the perfect poster child to
[34:50.080 --> 34:56.720]  actually have even a still image from a surveillance camera of Adam Lanza with
[34:56.720 --> 35:03.080]  this AR-15 assault rifle when in reality we've seen nothing no surveillance
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.440]  footage no still images of the shooter when in past you know mass shooting
[35:08.440 --> 35:13.880]  school shootings images of the shooter thinking about Columbine Virginia Tech
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.880]  have emerged within days but of Adam Lanza we've seen absolutely nothing is
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.320]  that one of the questions that you've been talking about it's a central
[35:23.320 --> 35:29.200]  question Paul the Sandy Hook School District installed a new security system
[35:29.200 --> 35:33.800]  in September now this is a very affluent community and they would not have cut
[35:33.800 --> 35:37.920]  corners in terms of video surveillance and the ability to be able to store that
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.860]  that video that's taken so there's a glaring problem here with regard to what
[35:43.860 --> 35:48.000]  is actually going on where is that video footage I think we can safely
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.920]  conclude that there was video footage captured but where where is it now one
[35:53.920 --> 36:01.280]  scenario is that the the one individual or team of individuals went in and went
[36:01.280 --> 36:07.200]  to the to the main office and may have turned off the video surveillance but
[36:07.200 --> 36:10.400]  we've not heard from the officials whether or not that is in fact the case
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.560]  if it was Adam Lanza would you have had the foresight and sophistication to
[36:15.560 --> 36:20.720]  be able to pull something like that off if it was a if it was a crew you know a
[36:20.720 --> 36:25.920]  team of of shooters that may that may have in fact been the case that's the
[36:25.920 --> 36:30.860]  only thing that I've heard about about possibly explaining why there might not
[36:30.860 --> 36:36.160]  be video surveillance other than them just holding back on it and attempting to
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.080]  for example doctorate that's something I believe that Mike Adams had a piece a
[36:41.080 --> 36:45.680]  couple of days ago about you know where is the the surveillance the surveillance
[36:45.680 --> 36:50.240]  footage it's a very big question because if they want to put a lot of our
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.040]  queries to rest they could release that we could see Lanza committing the
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.320]  crimes and that will be the end of it another thing that that might might
[36:59.320 --> 37:04.720]  point to is that handguns were used because those were what the initial
[37:04.720 --> 37:11.160]  reports stated in fact NBC News confirmed the reports from state and federal
[37:11.160 --> 37:15.320]  officials that there were four handguns used this was on the morning of
[37:15.320 --> 37:21.960]  December 15th Pete Williams on the NBC Today show that was changed on the
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.360]  afternoon of December 15th by the Connecticut Medical Examiner H
[37:26.360 --> 37:33.400]  Wayne Carver to being the AR-15 solely the AR-15 that that was used that was at
[37:33.400 --> 37:40.960]  the press conference at about 3 30 3 I believe 3 15 3 30 p.m. on December 15th
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.400]  and we've we had reports that the actual assault rifle was left in the vehicle
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.120]  but then the video showed the police removing what looked like a shotgun out
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.200]  of the trunk of the vehicle so do we know if we pinned down exactly what's
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.000]  going on with the specific weapons that were used or is that still contradictory
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.120]  I think that it's still contradictory the footage looks as if it was a shotgun but
[38:05.120 --> 38:11.480]  altogether there were I believe there were there were at least six weapons or
[38:11.480 --> 38:16.600]  seven weapons if you include at one point or another that that somehow
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.120]  materialize on the scene and then disappear there are the four pistols
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.600]  there's the AR-15 and then there are two enfield rifles that are referenced at
[38:26.600 --> 38:31.080]  one point or another in the reportage so you've got a total of I believe at least
[38:31.080 --> 38:36.600]  seven weapons that are that are mentioned that are pointed to by officials in
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.480]  in journalistic reports and then somehow disappear and then we are down to the one
[38:41.480 --> 38:47.360]  weapon the AR-15 which we we might at the very least surmise that this is what
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.880]  was one of the things one of the weapons it looks the most dangerous and the one
[38:51.880 --> 38:58.960]  that might be targeted in in legislation and executive orders now we've got these
[38:58.960 --> 39:03.300]  reports of two men in the woods obviously we've we've all seen the
[39:03.300 --> 39:07.320]  footage of them being apprehended in the woods one has been explained as a
[39:07.320 --> 39:12.840]  parent who went to the school to help his son bake I think it was gingerbread
[39:12.840 --> 39:16.760]  men or something that's kind of being explained he said he was he heard the
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.880]  gunshots he was petrified he ran away there was another report of a separate
[39:21.880 --> 39:27.080]  man in the woods though and it emerged in a new town B report quote a man with a
[39:27.080 --> 39:31.520]  gun who was spotted in the woods so this is a guy with a gun around a school
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.040]  massacre a man with a gun who was spotted in the woods near the school on the day
[39:36.040 --> 39:41.760]  of the incident was an off-duty tactical squad police officer from another town
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.360]  so why is it is a guy who's a police officer from another town in the woods
[39:47.360 --> 39:52.680]  outside where a massacre is taking place with a gun I mean is that a is that a
[39:52.680 --> 39:56.880]  place where people would go hunting right next to a school so professor just
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.120]  tell us about that you know the reports of additional individuals that may have
[40:00.120 --> 40:06.920]  been involved in this event well the the footage the aerial footage that is
[40:06.920 --> 40:14.000]  taken by the by the Associated Press shows at least one figure fleeing the
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.960]  scene being pursued by police officers so if there was someone up in the woods
[40:17.960 --> 40:23.080]  they must have come back down and then been chased back up back up into the
[40:23.080 --> 40:30.800]  into the woods at one point about a week or so ago J. Paul Vance the Connecticut
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.280]  State Police Lieutenant said that the individual up in the woods was just
[40:35.280 --> 40:39.120]  chopping wood just happened to be there chopping wood well maybe they came down to
[40:39.120 --> 40:42.800]  the school and got a drink of water or something and then went back up there
[40:42.800 --> 40:49.000]  that footage also shows you can see someone in the upper left hand portion
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.960]  of the of the video footage someone who emerges behind a tree and they remain
[40:54.960 --> 40:59.520]  unaccounted for so apparently they they escaped but of course as you know
[40:59.520 --> 41:04.080]  there's also the CBS footage of a bystander who remarks that this
[41:04.080 --> 41:10.120]  individual was paraded by them and said to said to them the onlookers that I
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.760]  didn't do it and then they took the individual and put them in the in the
[41:13.760 --> 41:20.880]  front seats of the of the patrol car I'm a I'm very skeptical of accepting the
[41:20.880 --> 41:27.400]  Newtown B for as a valid you know source for information after after the really
[41:27.400 --> 41:32.200]  contradictory reports initially from December 14th first of all quoting the
[41:32.200 --> 41:37.040]  principal don hawksprung and then retracting that never saying who actually
[41:37.040 --> 41:43.360]  was that they spoke to so I'm I'm really very suspicious of that of that
[41:43.360 --> 41:49.000]  particular medium and then apparently the individual that was that was spotted
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.880]  in the parking lot was a was a parent that as well I've not really seen any
[41:55.880 --> 42:02.800]  any can anything that would confirm confirm that I know that I know that
[42:02.800 --> 42:08.120]  that is that is out there but this was something this was an individual that was
[42:08.120 --> 42:14.400]  spotted by by someone by by a student who was being interviewed who had
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.240]  experienced the evacuation of the of the building and I believe that would have
[42:19.240 --> 42:26.280]  been the the alleged parent that somehow fled onto the onto the scene all of a
[42:26.280 --> 42:32.920]  all of a sudden there also questions with regard to the the alleged photograph
[42:32.920 --> 42:39.000]  of the evacuation of the 15 or 16 students that were being evacuated that
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.480]  really did make the national and international news that was supposedly
[42:45.480 --> 42:54.000]  taken by one of the Newtown B associate editors as she came onto the scene in
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.240]  the back of the first responders and she said that she was taking photographs
[42:59.240 --> 43:03.920]  left and right and yet only two photographs emerge from that that series
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.560]  of photos so there there's this conflicting information as well with
[43:09.560 --> 43:14.560]  regard to the the additional suspects on the scene but we've not really been
[43:14.560 --> 43:20.120]  given any conclusive evidence as to as far as I'm concerned really as as as to
[43:20.120 --> 43:24.800]  who they were and and what they were doing there and whether or not they
[43:24.800 --> 43:30.240]  they may have may have been accessories in the crime yeah there are a lot of
[43:30.240 --> 43:35.080]  questions about the lack of children the lack of parents the lack of teachers
[43:35.080 --> 43:40.000]  being seen in the actual surrounding area after the massacres happened you of
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.240]  course the schools on lockdown for a time but then everybody was evacuated
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.560]  I was I was thinking maybe that's only because the the mass media showed up
[43:49.560 --> 43:57.720]  quite a while later after everybody had already been evacuated yeah that may
[43:57.720 --> 44:04.520]  have been the case if you note the the school shooting at Union of excuse me
[44:04.520 --> 44:10.160]  Taft Union High School out by Bakersfield there was there was media on
[44:10.160 --> 44:17.240]  the scene there and that's a school comparable in in in student body to to
[44:17.240 --> 44:24.080]  the Newtown to Sandy Hook they're about 850 900 students there and there's a
[44:24.080 --> 44:29.200]  there's a very evident evacuation taking place there where the sidewalks are
[44:29.200 --> 44:35.000]  flooded with students but we see none of that in Newtown and where the students
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.320]  would have converged over at the the the fire hall the fire station there's a
[44:41.320 --> 44:47.240]  limited degree of activity there as well so some of these things also made made
[44:47.240 --> 44:51.800]  me suspicious exactly what is what is going on here is this an event that is
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.320]  in some way shape or form being embellished because I think that's
[44:55.320 --> 44:59.400]  something took place there as well but I'm wondering is to what to what degree
[44:59.400 --> 45:07.440]  it may be somewhat fortified if you will and also there were these bizarre
[45:07.440 --> 45:12.640]  reports of people dressed as nuns fleeing the scene in a purple van and
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.680]  then we've got this photograph of these black veils being found near the scene
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.080]  on the ground did you did you hear about that report well yeah I believe in fact
[45:21.080 --> 45:26.120]  that it was someone who was calling the Alex Jones show on the morning of the
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.320]  incident that reported reported this initially and that's the first time that
[45:30.320 --> 45:36.400]  it it emerged really on the news and there was a there was also a an
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.640]  article on the the the Intel hub that delves into this to some degree in fact
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.840]  I believe there is a photograph taken of these these individuals and they're
[45:46.840 --> 45:52.360]  wearing they're wearing footwear similar to what what police officers would
[45:52.360 --> 45:57.720]  would wear yeah I actually saw that photo earlier today it's definitely
[45:57.720 --> 46:02.520]  bizarre but I mean the problem we've got is you know amidst all these
[46:02.520 --> 46:06.000]  legitimate questions about the narrative you know what happened who was
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.640]  involved there's a plethora of claims that are obviously either completely
[46:10.640 --> 46:15.560]  baseless or are you know woefully reductionist and I think the whole thing
[46:15.560 --> 46:20.120]  about Emily Parker supposedly not being killed and then being included in that
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.640]  photo with Obama is clearly one of them because if you look at the high res
[46:24.640 --> 46:30.080]  images you can quite clearly prove that it is in fact her sister who obviously
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.240]  wasn't one of the victims so I mean what do you say to the idea that you know
[46:35.240 --> 46:41.640]  some people are really making huge leaps of logic and in doing so detracting from
[46:41.640 --> 46:45.840]  any real understanding of what happened because I've seen some really just
[46:45.840 --> 46:50.440]  crazy things like you know Robbie Parker one of the parents is actually Tony
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.520]  Hawke the skateboard guy so it's get there's a lot of people poisoning the
[46:54.520 --> 46:59.120]  well with bizarre craziness and it's really not helping us understand what
[46:59.120 --> 47:05.400]  actually happened is it well I've seen a lot of activity on my blog as well the
[47:05.400 --> 47:11.480]  comments and things of the like and I I think that there is definitely a program
[47:11.480 --> 47:18.640]  to sow misinformation in the stream of information in order to to muddy the
[47:18.640 --> 47:25.560]  waters and and in the process discredit the research really the research that
[47:25.560 --> 47:30.240]  independent researchers and the like are putting together and alternative
[47:30.240 --> 47:36.200]  media because if you can if you can if you can discredit it or muddy the
[47:36.200 --> 47:40.680]  waters to a limited degree and in one area you can paint with a fairly broad
[47:40.680 --> 47:47.040]  brush the mainstream corporate media can do that so I you know I'm not very
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.640]  surprised if things like that are being are being spread I'm also somewhat
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.760]  suspicious of the you know some of the web pages or some of for examples a
[47:57.760 --> 48:03.640]  Facebook page that is created a few days ahead of time these are very curious
[48:03.640 --> 48:10.280]  curious phenomena I know less about the phase the mechanics of Facebook and the
[48:10.280 --> 48:14.600]  extent to which dates can be changed to really draw any conclusions with with
[48:14.600 --> 48:20.400]  regard with regard to that it's it's somewhat one has to be careful as as
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.880]  well well I mean that that is interesting but it for me it's not proof of
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.880]  anything because you can create a Facebook page and then rename it to
[48:30.880 --> 48:34.600]  something else so the original timestamp on the Facebook page will say you
[48:34.600 --> 48:38.880]  know for example December 10th and then you rename it to something else later
[48:38.880 --> 48:44.520]  on also obviously I work in you know we're publishing and you can change a
[48:44.520 --> 48:49.840]  timestamp as easy as anything so I mean that for me that's you know it's quite
[48:49.840 --> 48:52.800]  bizarre like a lot of the other stuff but it's not really proof of anything
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.400]  we're gonna get back into the details show I just want to get your take on
[48:57.400 --> 49:03.000]  this Louise Tambaschio who was a family friend of the Lanzas told 60 minutes
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.840]  quote I know he was on medication and professor why over a month later do we
[49:08.840 --> 49:14.240]  not know anything about what psychiatric drugs Adam Lanza was on but I think
[49:14.240 --> 49:18.960]  that this is a very valid question that journalists such as John Rappaport have
[49:18.960 --> 49:25.200]  have asserted why is it that that we don't know what the his physician's name
[49:25.200 --> 49:29.760]  is if he was in fact under psychiatric care or the equivalent and and what
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.280]  types of what types of drugs he may have been on there's a drug that I've
[49:34.280 --> 49:41.640]  never heard of called I believe Pam aft that that he was supposedly on but again
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.520]  there there's a limited amount of information that's been that's been
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.360]  disclosed by by authorities or or otherwise there was actually talking
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.280]  about disinformation there was an individual who claimed to be Lanzas
[49:57.280 --> 50:02.440]  uncle who was circulating around the media a few weeks ago now and he
[50:02.440 --> 50:07.680]  actually put out the the name of the drug that Lanza was supposedly on bunch of
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.360]  publications ran with it including New York magazine I think and it was
[50:12.360 --> 50:16.600]  complete disinfo it was completely made up so again another example of how
[50:16.600 --> 50:21.080]  people are poisoning the well to distract people from understanding what
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.040]  actually happened but of course it took nearly six months to get a
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.280]  confirmation that James Holmes was on psychiatric drugs but we still don't
[50:30.280 --> 50:36.320]  know exactly which one so again as you said I mean these SSRIs are the elephant
[50:36.320 --> 50:40.000]  in the living room aren't they because while the media will talk about you
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.760]  know video games and things like that they won't address the psychiatric drugs
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.520]  that are prevalent amongst almost all of these mass shooters throughout the last
[50:49.520 --> 50:56.440]  20 years well actually Sanjay Gupta did a piece on CNN talk about it after the
[50:56.440 --> 51:00.920]  break gotta leave it there for now we'll be back stay tuned if you've ever
[51:00.920 --> 51:04.640]  wanted one of our best-selling generators but we're waiting for an offer so
[51:04.640 --> 51:08.480]  crazy you couldn't refuse then you're not gonna want to miss this exciting
[51:08.480 --> 51:13.040]  message here's why our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power and
[51:13.040 --> 51:18.080]  unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no fumes and produce

[54:14.280 --> 54:18.800]  Adams will be here in the second half of the show to take you to the end of the
[54:18.800 --> 54:22.920]  broadcast but right now we're talking to Professor James Tracy of Florida
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.880]  Atlantic University he's controversially questioned the official narrative
[54:27.880 --> 54:32.920]  behind the Sandy Hook school shooting and he's been demonized and attacked by
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.520]  the likes of CNN and Fox News for doing so I'm gonna say your calls for the
[54:37.520 --> 54:47.680]  professor coming up shortly at 800-259-9231 that's 800-259-9231 we were
[54:47.680 --> 54:51.880]  talking about some of the some of the disinformation that gets mixed into all
[54:51.880 --> 54:57.400]  these questions which kind of poisons the well and obviously I believe that
[54:57.400 --> 55:03.000]  this was a horrible tragedy for all the parents involved and I believe that some
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.120]  of the people who are asking questions about this not the professor but a lot
[55:07.120 --> 55:12.440]  of people on YouTube have handled it in a rather insensitive way of course we've
[55:12.440 --> 55:16.440]  had reports about them harassing some of the people who were involved and
[55:16.440 --> 55:22.160]  basically it doesn't do us any favors so we need to treat it obviously with
[55:22.160 --> 55:27.240]  extreme caution because it's a very traumatic event and I think one of the
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.520]  aspects of this which a lot of people have claimed professor is this whole
[55:32.520 --> 55:38.280]  idea that there were quote crisis actors who were working with the media to
[55:38.280 --> 55:43.280]  create a fake narrative surrounding this event and this is where we probably
[55:43.280 --> 55:47.880]  differ but just give us your take on the whole crisis actors angle explain what
[55:47.880 --> 55:55.960]  that is now the crisis actors is a group based out of out of Denver, Colorado I
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.280]  believe and they work in association with the Department of Homeland Security
[56:01.280 --> 56:09.120]  on active shooter drills so they are involved in playing the roles of by
[56:09.120 --> 56:18.880]  standards of perhaps the shooter himself the the victims in some cases the
[56:18.880 --> 56:25.320]  individuals involved in posting things to social media in other words they they
[56:25.320 --> 56:32.040]  are they are all encompassing in creating an environment for a lifelike
[56:32.040 --> 56:36.600]  drill now there was a drill that took place by the way along these lines now
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.080]  I don't know if crisis actors were involved but this was in a in a school
[56:40.080 --> 56:45.160]  for disabled children in Harlem and the children were absolutely absolutely
[56:45.160 --> 56:50.880]  terrified so in some cases it's not known whether or not an event is
[56:50.880 --> 56:56.000]  actually taking place but it's made more lifelike by the crisis actors again I
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.920]  don't know if they were involved in that particular drill and that's an incident
[56:58.920 --> 57:04.280]  that sort of foamed beyond the you know the the mainstream media radar but these
[57:04.280 --> 57:09.920]  individuals are there they're deployed within the community and they go ahead
[57:09.920 --> 57:15.280]  and they they you know they they again they they embellish the the particular
[57:15.280 --> 57:25.000]  event so in the if this were a drill that somehow went live as we know that
[57:25.000 --> 57:31.680]  for example 9-11 and the 7705 bombings were then it would have
[57:31.680 --> 57:37.360]  involved actors along these lines and they would not even know whether or not
[57:37.360 --> 57:44.560]  the the drill itself went live one of the things that that made me made me
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.240]  questioned in this regard was looking at the video footage as well as the
[57:49.240 --> 57:53.640]  photographic evidence emerging from the scene and as you had alluded to earlier
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.240]  there were just you know there were there were few few few bystanders and
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.360]  the like there were very few people actually being interviewed when you
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.320]  would think there would be a great many people on the on the scene now maybe
[58:06.320 --> 58:11.440]  what you say is correct maybe the media got there late and and and there was no
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.760]  photographic or video evidence along those lines there were just a few people
[58:15.760 --> 58:20.160]  that they could actually interview but that's one of the one of the reasons
[58:20.160 --> 58:25.560]  that I actually put that for the possibility of there being crisis actors
[58:25.560 --> 58:29.880]  and I think it's probably been the most controversial okay we'll be back after
[58:29.880 --> 58:34.000]  the break stay there your calls for professor Tracy coming up it's the
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.280]  Alex Jones show stay tuned

[1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:27.760]  It's Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today we're talking to
[1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:33.760]  professor James Tracy of Florida Atlantic University he's questioned the
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:38.760]  official narrative behind the Sandy Hook school massacre and basically been
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:43.760]  pursued by CNN as a result of it and other news organizations we're gonna go to
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:53.760]  calls shortly the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 before the break
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:58.760]  we were talking about the idea that some of these individuals involved in this
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:03.760]  event may have been actors or participants in a drill of course we know
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:10.760]  that drills shadow both 9 11 and 7 7 and you have to frame all this while being
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:14.760]  sensitive to the fact that it was a according to my mind a very real
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:19.760]  tragedy involving very real victims but you have to frame it in the context that
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:25.760]  you know under fast and furious the Obama administration sent 2,000 assault
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:32.760]  weapons to drug lords in Mexico resulting in the deaths of over 300 people
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:37.760]  many of them children so to claim that this would be beyond a government to
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:44.760]  stoop to such a level to kill 20 kids to ram through their political agenda is
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:49.760]  somewhat naive given what we've seen historically with the likes of operation
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:54.760]  gladio another false flag terror programs which are on the record all
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:58.760]  admitted they've been subject to parliamentary investigations in
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:03.760]  countries like Italy admitted that you know government stage mass shootings
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.760]  they stage bombings they bomb trains for their own political agenda so asking
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:14.760]  questions about an event that has been the fulcrum of the Obama
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:20.760]  administration's agenda on gun control is only sensible while of course
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:25.760]  maintaining that respect that dignity that sensitivity for the victims but
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:31.760]  what sprung to my mind before the break is professor straight after the collapse
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:37.760]  of the twin towers on 9-11 we had people on the ground who seem to know
[1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:42.760]  bizarrely intricate details of how that collapsed happened which just happened
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:47.760]  to then morph almost immediately into the official story so I guess that's
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:50.760]  what you're talking about when you're talking about actors being involved
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:53.760]  you're not saying there were no victims you're just saying that people may have
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.760]  been there to massage the narrative is that correct yes that's correct fall I
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:04.760]  I'm simply posing questions and I never said anything
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:10.760]  declarative in any of my my articles about this happened I was saying it could
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:15.760]  this be a possibility and yet the media took that and ran with it I took you
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:20.760]  know the that might took my assertion as a is an allegation when it was
[1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:24.760]  merely a question that unfortunately is how is how this has been framed and
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:29.760]  how I think that it is it's been offensive to the especially to the people
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:35.760]  that lost their loved ones up there in Newtown I never actually intended that
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:39.760]  in any way shape or form but certainly yes what you point out with regard to
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:46.760]  9-11 is is really right on in that there this idea that a steel frame
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:52.760]  building could could collapse as a result of the heat from the airplanes I
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:58.760]  think is is is something that was that was put out there at the time to to
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:04.760]  to sort of deflect any questioning as to how could this have actually taken
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:10.760]  place these two these buildings going down in such a way in their own footprint
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:13.760]  just got a minute to go to the break we're going to go to your call as the
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:18.760]  first of which is Adam will go to him after the break and other aspects that
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:24.760]  I want to get into obviously we've got things about Adam Lanza's car picture
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:28.760]  with all four doors open why would that be the case if he was just exiting the
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:33.760]  car on his own as you mentioned earlier the school principal gives a quote to
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:37.760]  the new town be describing the attack but she's actually the first victim of
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:42.760]  the attack that's another inconsistency that hasn't been explained we'll go into

[1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:57.760]  Obama administration sent 2000 assault weapons to drug lords in Mexico
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:03.760]  leading to the deaths of 300 people so if you think it's beyond the Obama
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:08.760]  administration to engage in murder to further their gun control agenda
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:13.760]  remembering the fact that it was Obama himself back in April 2011 who told
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:19.760]  Sarah Brady in a White House meeting he was working quote under the radar to
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:23.760]  sneak attack the second amendment then we'd be very naive to think that they
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:29.760]  wouldn't engage in such activity we're talking to professor James Tracy
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:33.760]  about the sandy hook massacre the questions that he's raised about the
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:39.760]  event and subsequently being attacked by the media for asking Adam in Canada
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:44.760]  you're on the air go ahead Adam yeah kudos for having the courage to cover
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:51.760]  this I have a couple questions go ahead yeah I think it's great that he got
[1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:55.760]  the thing about the shotgun and the trunk right and the dress for the daughter
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:10:00.760]  those those are all but what I haven't heard I'd like to hear him talk about
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:06.760]  is the question of whether or not that was Adam lands his car and also if
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:11.760]  you've seen some of the rebranding of businesses in the area if you go to
[1:10:11.760 --> 1:10:18.760]  Sandy Hook Hair Co.com Sandy Hook Hair Company and see their their whole
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:22.760]  image their whole the bloody handprint and the white heart and the palm and
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:26.760]  finally of course the the whole thing about the Batman map in the movie the
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:31.760]  Batman movie having Sandy Hook on it and also actually lining up to the road
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:36.760]  in Newton with a circle on the school which is the stadium that's attacking the
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:41.760]  movie go ahead professor okay well there's there's quite a bit there first
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:49.760]  with regard to to Adam lands his car this was apparently registered to a
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:58.760]  Chris Rodia and yet there was a an article that came out arguing that
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:04.760]  that this was not the case I think it was in a it was in a hearse paper that it
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:12.760]  was not it was the car was not registered to him but in fact it it turns out
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:19.760]  that that that it was and that Rodia you know he had a number of he had a
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:25.760]  number of run-ins with the law he had been involved apparently in in drug
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:31.760]  running and and the like so so that's that's as much as I know with regard to
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  with regard to the automobile and I what were the other questions the crazy
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:44.760]  rebranding of businesses for the Luminati symbology I mean totally out there
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  but go to Sandy Hook Hair Co.com and you'll see their website with a bloody
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:54.760]  red handprint and the all seeing white heart and the palm and then of course
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:12:00.760]  the whole Batman map Sandy Hook go to YouTube Batman map a strange comparison
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:06.760]  you'll see this one-minute video I've seen that professor but I mean there's a
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:10.760]  place obviously Gotham City is based on New York City and there's a place in
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.760]  New York City called Sandy Hook that's how I that's how I understood it
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:21.760]  yeah that does come up but I think one hour and 58 minutes into the the dark
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.760]  night rises there's that specifically on on the map from what I understand I
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:32.760]  haven't seen the movie in its entirety and someone somehow I saw that on my on
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  my blog just recently someone putting something in there with regard to the
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  hair salon or the hair company but I've not seen the actual the imagery
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:48.760]  itself so I can't I can't really comment on that okay thanks for the call
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:53.760]  yeah I think the thing with the car was how I read it was it was like a bleed
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:58.760]  in the police transmission types where he had been apprehended in a completely
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:02.760]  different city and that bled through to their transmission which is why it got
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.760]  confused with Adam Lanza that's how it was explained whether that's true or not
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:12.760]  I don't know yeah it was it was explained in a in a mainstream media outlet
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:18.760]  that he was mistaken but whether or not that is in fact the cases is still
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:24.760]  still somewhat questionable so but it's it's a it's a it's a very good
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  question and the other stuff doesn't really I mean it's all very weird but it
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:35.760]  doesn't prove anything for me Father James in California you're on the air go ahead
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:42.760]  good morning it's good to talk to you and let's start the show probably about a year
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:49.760]  and initially thought that that Alex was rather paranoid until I began researching
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:53.760]  everything they was talking about and finding so much important information
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:59.760]  you know I have family members that are educators my father served in special
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  forces in Vietnam and the kind of false flag attack is something that you know
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:12.760]  I've heard about from him you know in Vietnam he said it was a common tactic
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:18.760]  for them to go into a Vietnamese village do attacks leave that but in for the
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:25.760]  being North Vietnamese or Viet Cong then come in in subsequent days to respond to
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.760]  their outrage and recruit them to and train them to fight against the
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:33.760]  that gets the North Vietnamese so you know it's it's a tactic that's been around
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:38.760]  for a long time and thinking about these questions you know my thoughts have been
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:42.760]  that you know the conversation in the media especially as it's put out by the
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:48.760]  government is how many lives will we save by banning guns and I think the
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:54.760]  question really needs to be turned around you know how many lives are we going to
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:15:01.760]  sacrifice if we limit or restrict guns from law-abiding citizens and I think a
[1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:08.760]  very practical way to arm our teachers and we have a lot of police chiefs and
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:11.760]  sheriffs they're standing up now saying that they're going to defend Second
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:16.760]  Amendment rights a very simple approach would be for them to issue
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:21.760]  conceal and carry permits teachers and then to overcome the ban or gun to
[1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:26.760]  school is to deputize them you know sheriffs police chiefs can deputize
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:34.760]  citizens and service so they can train them license them deputize them and it'll
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  be legal for those teachers to have a firearm concealed on campus well
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:47.760]  professor would you professor would you feel safer if your kids were in a school
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:52.760]  where you knew the teacher had a safely locked away gun in the event of some
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:57.760]  crazed killer coming into the school I mean you would you feel safer well I
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:05.760]  certainly know that individuals such as Barack Obama his children go to a go to
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:10.760]  a school that is safe and secure in that regard and and has armed guards I think
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:15.760]  that's likely the case with many of the many of the country's elite and the you
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:21.760]  know the elite of the world they most of their children go to you know go to
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:26.760]  facilities go to institutions that have that type of security so why shouldn't
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:30.760]  the broader public and of course Obama just signed the bill where he gets
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  lifetime on secret service protection while all the rest of you locally
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:41.760]  peasant American citizens are disarmed Jacob in Illinois you're on the air
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:49.760]  Jacob go ahead oh hi been a listener for a couple days now I like to show I was
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:55.760]  wondering what kind of gun was it again that the kids were killed with like a
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:01.760]  big right for something I was wondering how did he how did he get it into the
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:06.760]  school in the first place professor professor that's what the medical
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:12.760]  examiner addressed isn't it if you want to cover it from that angle yeah this came
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:18.760]  up this is when the story was was significantly altered during that press
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:25.760]  conference from as far as as far as I can tell from the before handguns which is
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:32.760]  what was being reported at 8 o'clock or 8 30 a.m. on the NBC Today show to the
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:36.760]  single AR 15 and during that press conference and it's important to really
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:40.760]  look at that press conference because I think that's really the most revealing
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:48.760]  piece of evidence of information in this case is that this is the weapon is
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:55.760]  almost changed immediately from from the from the pistols to the AR 15 and
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:01.760]  even a reporter says speaks up and says but the the rifle was found in the car
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:06.760]  and at that point the Connecticut State Police Lieutenant Vance said that's not
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:11.760]  correct sir that's not correct so that it's at that point where where things
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:17.760]  change how he now how he got the weapon into the into the school well he he
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:21.760]  approached the according to the official story he approached the entrance of the
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:27.760]  school and he he shot shot out the the front the front door and with a hole
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:33.760]  big enough to to enter yet we've not seen any video evidence that that in fact
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:37.760]  took place nor has there been any video or photograph evidence of the the door
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:44.760]  itself the entry point itself thanks for the call Jacob Josh in California you're
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:52.760]  on the air with the professor Tracy go ahead all right Josh has dropped
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:57.760]  professor tell us about the this pejorative term conspiracy theory you
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:01.760]  wanted to talk about the dynamics between how that's being used by the
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:08.760]  establishment media in relation to this event well I think that as as an
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:14.760]  academic and I think this is also the case with regard to journalists they
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:19.760]  fear being called a conspiracy theorist that is the the pejorative that's
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:26.760]  being used against me to make an example out of me to threaten my job to get me
[1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:32.760]  to to be quiet to not ask questions it's important to think about the the how
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  this term originated how actually it developed there's an important book
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  called conspiracy theory in America that's being that's coming out in April
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:46.760]  of this year by a colleague of mine Lance to Haven Smith up a Florida State
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:53.760]  University now he helped to devise the the concept of state

[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:35.760]  with regard to the with regard to criticisms of the war
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:39.760]  on reports so they issued a dispatch to all of their
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:43.760]  offices and this dispatch right here
[1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:47.760]  it's number 1035-960
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:51.760]  it's available at the JFK Lancer website
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:55.760]  talks about how can I read a bit of this is that
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.760]  okay yeah we'll push for time but yeah quickly okay well
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:03.760]  it talks about the how a public opinion is almost 50%
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.760]  skeptical of the official conclusions of the war and commission report
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:11.760]  and talks further about employing propaganda assets
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:15.760]  to negate and refute the attacks of the critics
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:19.760]  and talks specifically about conspiracy theories and how to
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:23.760]  the specific techniques that one could use
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:27.760]  in CIA asset publications and by CIA assets themselves
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:31.760]  in the media industry
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.760]  to essentially subdue any sort of
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:39.760]  criticism and so what I'm getting at in that regard and you could
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  again go to the JFK Lancer site and read it since we're pressed for time
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:47.760]  and it's a key document because this is something that has
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  it has in many ways really created fear among
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.760]  journalists and among scholars to address anything that might be considered
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:25:59.760]  a conspiracy theory I think I know this more intimately than anyone
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.760]  because I can sense that fear among others
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:07.760]  you can't touch certain subjects such as 9-11
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.760]  because you might be accused of this and this is something that could
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:15.760]  it could cost you your job and or your credibility
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.760]  OK, Tallden, Florida, quickly please
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  final call, go ahead Tallden. Thanks for taking my call guys
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  I got some points about Sandia, thanks so much for talking about it today, I think it's something we all need to question
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  You mentioned the press conference, I feel that that is some very
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:35.760]  important information. Paul Vance dodged blatantly a question
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:39.760]  when asked what was Nancy Lanza's connection to the school
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.760]  I believe that he couldn't answer that question because later it came out that she had no connection
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:47.760]  However, there was a report on the scene from Sally Cox
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:51.760]  the 15 year alleged nurse at Sandy Hook who told a reporter
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:55.760]  that she knew Nancy Lanza and that she was an experienced
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:59.760]  kindergarten teacher. I think we need to question those things very
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:03.760]  very much. Are you also familiar
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:07.760]  with the fundraiser sites that the URLs were created
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:11.760]  before the event? Yeah, we talked about that a bit earlier
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:15.760]  I don't know if a medical examiner would actually
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:19.760]  have that information. What I would accept of him as a professional
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:23.760]  is to have information specific to the injuries
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:27.760]  the causes of death, the caliber of the bullets
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:31.760]  how many girls, how many boys were slain, these things are just
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  basic and they were not addressed by Dr. Carver
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.760]  not in any competent way and that's really the
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:43.760]  major thing that contributes to my skepticism and caused
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:47.760]  my initial questioning of the event
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:51.760]  Okay, thanks for the call, Todd. Professor, just tell people about your
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:55.760]  website, the other work you do there, how people can find out more information
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:59.760]  Yeah, memoryholeblog.com
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:03.760]  I've had the website since March, there's a lot of
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:07.760]  stuff on there. Primarily there's essays that I've written
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:11.760]  on political criticism
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  and events such as this
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  and things that might be regarded as conspiracies but attempting to analyze
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:23.760]  those and develop those in
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.760]  a historical context and in a more contemporary context. So it's
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:31.760]  memoryholeblog.com
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:35.760]  Professor James Tracy, Florida Atlantic University
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:39.760]  You won't be on CNN tonight then but you may be on in the next few days
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:43.760]  Well, they've got to get back to me and I'm willing to go on
[1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:47.760]  and keep them honest
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:51.760]  Fascinating questions raised once again and we hope to talk to you again soon
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.760]  Thank you very much
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:28:59.760]  Professor James Tracy raising questions about the Sandy Hook massacre
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.760]  and again, this has gone completely viral
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:07.760]  It even surprised me how crazy
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.760]  insane the interest in this is 10.6 million views
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:15.760]  on one video alone on YouTube that was created
[1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:19.760]  just 10, 11 days ago and in fact we're probably going to try and get the creators behind
[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:23.760]  that video on the show but tons of
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:27.760]  videos, tons of questions while still trying to maintain respect, dignity
[1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:31.760]  for the realization that this was a very real tragedy
[1:29:31.760 --> 1:29:35.760]  but we'll continue to ask questions about it. Mike Adams coming up
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:39.760]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live. I've been Paul Joseph Watson. InformWars.com

[1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:07.760]  of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:23.760]  Alright, we're back here on the Alex Jones show and this is Mike Adam
[1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:27.760]  stepping in for the next hour and a half here. I want to thank Paul Joseph Watson
[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:31.760]  for his eye-opening interview there. I didn't catch all of it because
[1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:35.760]  I was obviously driving in for it to be here.
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:39.760]  But we've got even more great information coming up. This is just hard hitting
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:43.760]  day after day, hour after hour. Here's what we have coming up right now on the phone
[1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:47.760]  with us and he'll be joining us in just a minute. His representative Steve Toth
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:51.760]  from Texas who is the person introducing the
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:55.760]  Firearms Protection Act that he was on the show
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:33:59.760]  two days ago here with Alex and he's got more updates for us and I have some
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:03.760]  new questions for him as well so we'll get an update on that.
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:07.760]  Today I'm going to give you just a little commentary on Lance Armstrong
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.760]  and his now staged confession
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:15.760]  that he lied all along and that all the people that he bullied and threatened
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:19.760]  and intimidated were actually correct in saying that he doped.
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:23.760]  So give you a little breakdown on that but I'm not going to spend too much time on that
[1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:27.760]  because there's far more important things happening in this world than Lance Armstrong's career.
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:31.760]  We've got Smart Gun RFID technology now being discussed
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.760]  for firearms. This is part of
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:39.760]  Obama's 23 now famous or infamous executive orders
[1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:43.760]  and new ways to track firearms owners and
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:47.760]  the New York PD is also even now suggesting that they should put RFID chips into your
[1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:51.760]  medication. That's what they want to track is your drugs
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:55.760]  and your guns and your money, your cash and probably
[1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:59.760]  everything else. It's getting crazy. In any case let's go to Representative Steve Toth
[1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:03.760]  who is online with us and he joins us for an update. Mr. Toth
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:07.760]  thank you for joining us once again here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:11.760]  Thanks so much Mike, I appreciate it. It's great to have you on. I heard your interview a couple
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:15.760]  of days ago. I'm very proud that you
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:19.760]  are the kind of person who represents the state of Texas. You're a business owner,
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.760]  you're a successful person in the private space, in the private industry
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:27.760]  and you get it about the Second Amendment, about freedom, you're well
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:31.760]  spoken, you're highly intelligent. I think your bill is going to be very successful. What
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:35.760]  is your read so far on the level of support for this Firearms Protection Act?
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:39.760]  Well, think about this for a second.
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:43.760]  There are two elements that are really critical for this bill going through.
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:47.760]  One is the people of the state of Texas and the second
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:51.760]  is the lawmakers here in Austin and
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:55.760]  we have all been shocked.
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:59.760]  I mean I knew it was an issue and it's not just about the Second Amendment
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:03.760]  this is really more about the 10th Amendment than it is the Second Amendment. This is about
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:07.760]  preserving states right. This is about
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:11.760]  an executive order and eat it by a king
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:15.760]  and not having prominence over
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:19.760]  the legislative process that's laid out
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:23.760]  in both the Texas and the Midwest Constitution.
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:27.760]  So where things are going really well with this legislation
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:31.760]  is out in the streets
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.760]  in homes and businesses and restaurants,
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:39.760]  all over Texas people are talking about it. The problem is that
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:43.760]  there are going to be some competing bills that are more moderate.
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.760]  We don't need a moderate approach to a desperate problem that is facing America.
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:51.760]  We need a strong bill
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:55.760]  that has real teeth that day one when it goes into effect
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:59.760]  the Obama administration is going to file an injunction
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:03.760]  in the Fifth Circuit probably to put a stop to it
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:07.760]  so that this gets challenged all the way to the Supreme Court.
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:11.760]  That is exactly what we need and so if a moderate
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:15.760]  bill goes through without any teeth that they can just overlook
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:19.760]  and ignore then that's what will happen.
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:23.760]  There are a lot of different bills right now but we need for people in the state of Texas
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.760]  to get behind the Firearms Protection Act because that is the bill
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:31.760]  that is the legislation that has the teeth in it
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:35.760]  that the Obama administration is going to force their hand.
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:39.760]  What is the actual composition of support in the
[1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:43.760]  Texas legislature for possibly being able to
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:47.760]  actually pass this? I mean I know the Austin
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:51.760]  area representative. Here's the deal. We're going to get a bill through.
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:55.760]  No questions asked. We're going to get a bill through in response to what
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:59.760]  the president has done. The problem is that there are some more moderate
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:03.760]  bills that have come forward since
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:07.760]  this whole thing, since this media firestorm has erupted
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:11.760]  over the issue. There are some more moderate bills that have come forward
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:15.760]  that frankly are going to undermine what we're trying to do here.
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.760]  When you say moderate, for example, your bill makes it a felony crime for
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:23.760]  a federal official to try to enforce an unconstitutional order in the state of Texas.
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:27.760]  Are you saying that, for example, that felony is not
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:31.760]  present in a less powerful bill?
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:35.760]  That doesn't mean it's a bill. It also looks more like a suggestion or a house
[1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:39.760]  resolution than it does a bill. You might as well just do a house resolution.
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:43.760]  We need a bill that has real teeth in it.
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:47.760]  We need to draw a line in the sand and say enough. We're done.
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:51.760]  Now when this was attempted, drawing a line in the sand, I think
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:55.760]  roughly a year ago with the TSA. TSA bill that David Simpson put
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:59.760]  through exactly. Exactly, yeah. The thing about that bill is that
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:03.760]  if it started too late, if it had started in January like this one
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:07.760]  is, then that bill would have had
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:11.760]  what our bill has right now, which is
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:15.760]  it's got this broad base of support from people all over Texas.
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:19.760]  My phone is being rung off the hook right now. We can't get
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:23.760]  to all the causes as possible. Well, I'm sure that's the case.
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:27.760]  I was in a gun shop just the other day and I asked the owner
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  did you hear about Representative Toth's bill and they said, are you kidding me? Everybody that walks
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:35.760]  in our doors keeps telling us about it. Yeah, I mean, it's
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:39.760]  really cool. I don't know if
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:43.760]  I'm going to get on a faith
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.760]  track here for a second, but
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:51.760]  this has been so encouraging and the Lord has so encouraged us over and I'll
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:55.760]  tell you why. Kendall Croker is a really great guy. He's the guy that
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:39:59.760]  started this thing in Wyoming. I want to give him credit for it.
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:03.760]  Kendall's the one that started this whole thing. What was really cool is
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:07.760]  our office got a call yesterday from Kendall's sister
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:11.760]  and she said, you know, of all the states that Kendall's sister could
[1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:15.760]  live in, what do you think the chances are that his sister out of 50 states
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:19.760]  just happens to live in Texas and out of 150 house
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:23.760]  districts across the state of Texas, what are the chances
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:27.760]  that I live in Steve's district? Wow, she lives in
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:31.760]  District 15, huh? She lives in my district and she goes, you know, we just were behind
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:35.760]  you when we were behind this legislation. You guys are trying to do it the right way
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:39.760]  and we want the people in the
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.760]  state of Texas to get behind it because if
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.760]  Abraham Lincoln said this, he said, if you don't have the people behind you, you can't do anything great.
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:51.760]  I don't want to do it. I don't want to do something moderate. I want to do something great.
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:55.760]  If you guys get fired up about it and if you're willing to call your
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:59.760]  representatives and your senators about it, then we can get a strong bill through.
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:03.760]  That is a message and also because this is a national and even a
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:07.760]  global audience, this matters to all of you who are listening right now
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:11.760]  no matter what state you live in in the United States or even what country you live in
[1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:15.760]  because if Texas can set the precedent to standing up
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:19.760]  to unconstitutional executive orders from the executive branch of the federal
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  government, that's at the precedent that applies to all 50 states, right Mr. Toth?
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:27.760]  Yeah, I mean, think about this folks. When you take your kid to the pediatrician
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:31.760]  do you want the pediatrician to stay in the little Johnny? Hey, does your mom
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:35.760]  or your daddy have a gun at home? Right. I mean, seriously,
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:39.760]  I mean, this is no different than how things were in red china when they were
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:43.760]  turning kids against their parents. This is no different than how things were in the early days
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:47.760]  of Nazi Germany. Or Stasi
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:51.760]  secret police under Mussolini or whatever. Yeah, you're right. It's the same kind
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.760]  of snitch society of reporting people reporting on a citizens
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:59.760]  to the feds to be disarmed or even jailed. This is right and
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:03.760]  as part of this, you know, here's how he did things. When he got Obamacare
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:07.760]  through, it was this nebulous 3,700 page.
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:11.760]  We don't know what's in it until we pass it. We can't read it until we
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:15.760]  pass it. 3,700 pages of nebulous, innocuous stuff.
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:19.760]  Oh, don't worry about it. It's fuzzy. It's fluffy. It's cuddly. Don't
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:23.760]  worry about it. There are no sharp edges to it whatsoever. It gets passed now.
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:27.760]  It's 37,000 pages. The only thing worse than a politician
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:31.760]  that's been in Austin or Washington too long is an
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:35.760]  unelected bureaucrat that's been there too long. And they are the ones,
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:39.760]  they're the dangerous ones that will put words and it will put substance
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:43.760]  to these 23 actions that the president has handed out.
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:47.760]  Yeah. That's right. Folks, we better be worried about it.
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:51.760]  Let me ask your opinion. Attorney General, Texas Attorney General
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:55.760]  Greg Abbott put out an ad recently in
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.760]  New York. And I love this and I love what Mr. Abbott has done here.
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:03.760]  And this was written up in Reuters with the following title.
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:07.760]  Y'all come to Texas. State official tells New York gun owners.
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:11.760]  It was a great ad by Mr. Abbott. I mean, he helped organize
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:15.760]  it to say that if you want to come to a state where you have more freedom
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:19.760]  and lower taxes and more liberties, come to Texas and bring your rifle
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:23.760]  and your ammunition. I thought it was fantastic. What are your thoughts on Mr. Abbott's
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:27.760]  actions in regard to that publicity? I mean, I hit on that last night
[1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:31.760]  when I was on Hannity and I had a very close friend of mine that saw the interview
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:35.760]  and he said, if you'll get my resume, I'll murder and I'll pack our backs tomorrow.
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:39.760]  And you know, here's the reality. It's not just
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:43.760]  like the governor told John, you're not going to be 15%
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:47.760]  off better simply because there are no state income taxes. Our standard, our
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:51.760]  cost of living is 30% lower.
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:55.760]  So for those of you that aren't here yet, I
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:59.760]  grew up in upstate New York. I moved here in 1997 because I believed
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:03.760]  in my heart of hearts, this is the best place to raise my family.
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:07.760]  And the people of Texas have welcomed us and made a home for us.
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:11.760]  And I'm just going to tell you, the quality of living
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:15.760]  will be twice as good and the cost of living will be a third of what you're paying
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:19.760]  anywhere else. Absolutely. That's one of the reasons I'm here. And plus, I just
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.760]  love the liberty and I love, I am proud of being in Texas and knowing
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:27.760]  that Texas has people like you, Mr. Toth, and people like Mr. Abbott, who I
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:31.760]  hear has aims maybe for the governorship, which maybe
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:35.760]  he'd be the perfect person to do that down the road when that opportunity arises. But I
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:39.760]  am proud to be in a state that says, we have liberty here
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:43.760]  and we're going to stand for it. We are going to stand up against tyranny.
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:47.760]  We're going to pass the laws that nullify unconstitutional orders. We
[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:51.760]  are Texans and we're not laying down for a bunch of tyrants. I love that
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:55.760]  attitude. We've got, I mean, yeah, but we need to hear
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:59.760]  from all of you. I mean, and let the phones ring right
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:03.760]  now. Call General Abbott's office and let him know that you're going to get behind the Farms Protection Act.
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:07.760]  Yes. Let him hear it. He needs to hear from you guys.
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:11.760]  They want to be about,
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:15.760]  this isn't a lack of leadership. This is, they want to
[1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:19.760]  hear from the people. They need the people to be heard. They want
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:23.760]  to hear from you guys. Which one of these bills, do you want something more moderate?
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:27.760]  He'll support something more moderate. But if they hear from the grassroots of Texas
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:31.760]  that they want to build with teeth in it,
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:35.760]  then tell the Attorney General's office that
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:39.760]  you're going to stand behind the Farms Protection Act and you want him to as well,
[1:45:39.760 --> 1:45:43.760]  respectfully, because he's a good man. Exactly. Yeah. And that's the message
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.760]  all of you out there who are tired of being oppressed and
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:51.760]  having your rights eroded by executive orders or the
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:55.760]  federal government in whatever way. And there's a lot of this happening in agriculture too with the
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:45:59.760]  Food Safety Modernization Act that just hammers small farmers in Texas as well.
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:03.760]  I've even covered that. The time. Can I share another one? Yeah, sure.
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.760]  Go ahead, please. There is a terrible curriculum
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:11.760]  going through the schools today. It's called CSCO. It is an 80% of the schools
[1:46:11.760 --> 1:46:15.760]  across the state of Texas. Parents are not allowed to view it.
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:19.760]  They're not allowed to go online to look at it. It's a portal, an online
[1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:23.760]  curriculum. Parents are not allowed to look at it.
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:27.760]  Teachers are forced to sign non-disclosure agreements about what's
[1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:31.760]  in it. Really? It's filled with Islam.
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:35.760]  It is the worst of the worst of the worst.
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.760]  Where did this come from? Well, it started with
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:43.760]  here's the problem. When you start a government agency, you can't kill it.
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:47.760]  These education service centers in the state of Texas that 20, 30 years
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:51.760]  ago, when we were in school and you wanted a film strip or you
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:55.760]  wanted a 16 millimeter movie, you would go to the Education Service Center
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:59.760]  where they were the ball basically for all the equipment
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:03.760]  and all these great films and slides and everything else. We don't need that anymore because
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:07.760]  we have this thing called the internet and streaming video and audio and all that cool stuff.
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.760]  We get it over the internet. Like any good government
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:15.760]  agency, it became a solution in search of a problem.
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:19.760]  What they did was they came out with this thing called CSCO. They spent millions
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:23.760]  of dollars in taxpayers money on it.
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:27.760]  It's not under the guys. It's not under the supervision, auspices of the
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:31.760]  state board of education. These liberals that are running it can basically
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:35.760]  say and do anything that they want without the approval of the state board of education
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.760]  who are elected by we the people. You see, that's their attack point now is to try
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:43.760]  to indoctrinate the next generation. It is exactly what they're trying to do.
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.760]  And with all these TV shows too that are coming out, I don't know how much you're aware of those, but
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:51.760]  this show about they hate Paul Revere and a show
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:55.760]  about using the founding fathers and most of these shows.
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.760]  Get this. The Tea Party, the Boston Tea Party,
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:03.760]  they're referred to as CSCO because terrorists.
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:07.760]  Not surprising. Well, they're going for broke, Mr. Tilt.
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:11.760]  This is Texas. Yeah, they're trying to turn
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:15.760]  any person who just believes in the Constitution and the founding fathers into a total outright terrorist.
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:19.760]  It's now in our faces. There can no longer be any doubt.
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.760]  They're not beating around the bush, so to speak. They're going for your
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:27.760]  freedoms just outright. Oh man, unbelievable.
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:31.760]  So, Mr. Toth, let me ask you a question on different track.
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:35.760]  What are you doing to protect your personal safety? And I mean this
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:39.760]  sincerely. I've been threatened before. Alex Jones obviously has been
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:43.760]  threatened many, many times. Are you taking steps to make sure
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  that they don't put you in a situation that could compromise your integrity
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:51.760]  on spearheading this kind of bill? Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:55.760]  I live my life with a high degree of
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:01.760]  accountability. I live with, my legislation director is a guy that I've
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:05.760]  known from church for years. I live with him and his wife in Austin. Yes.
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:09.760]  I don't live in an apartment by myself. Good. And
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:13.760]  Michael and his wife, Brittany, Carrie,
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:17.760]  they have CHLs they both carry. My chief of staff
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:21.760]  carries. My office would be the worst office
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  to come into in the capital if you want to inflict harm on
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  Troy. Good. Right. Good. And plus there's a lot of concealed carry patriots
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  walking around that building as well. I know because sometimes I'm one of them.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:37.760]  Yeah. And you know, that's just, hey, here's the deal. If we don't
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.760]  stand up, we have no future. We just don't. Our
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.760]  children will have no future. And that's what this is all about.
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:49.760]  You know, this job only carries 600 bucks a month.
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:53.760]  You're not going to get rich doing it. In fact, you're probably, your business probably
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:57.760]  will end up taking ahead as a result of it. Yeah. Right. But
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:01.760]  if we don't stand up, all of us, we've all got a part to play, even if it's just
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:05.760]  calling the attorney general and calling the governor and calling your state representative
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.760]  to say, get behind the Firearms Protection
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:13.760]  Act. Absolutely. Absolutely. You've got to get a website
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.760]  going where we can, you know, publicize that URL and build
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:21.760]  momentum. I'll even donate some software technology
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  to you, by the way. I founded a software company many years
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:29.760]  ago. I'll donate that to your office so you can have an email list
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:33.760]  engine that works. I mean, you've got to get something going. We can just give it out
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:37.760]  on the air and get people to that website. I'll have Amy get going on
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:41.760]  it today. Yeah. I mean, if there's anyone out there that can help us develop
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.760]  the website, that would be great too. All right. All right. Well, thank you
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:49.760]  for joining us, Representative Tooth. We're out of time, but God bless you.
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:53.760]  Thank you. Take care. We'll be right back here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:57.760]  Stay with us a lot more straight ahead. That was Representative Tooth with the
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:51:01.760]  Update on the Firearms Protection Act in the state of Texas. If you've ever wanted
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:05.760]  one of our best-selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer so crazy
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:09.760]  that you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:13.760]  Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power,
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:17.760]  and unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes,
[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:21.760]  and produce electricity from the sun. So when the lights go out,
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:25.760]  you'll always have the power you need. Now, here's the best part. Every year
[1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:29.760]  we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:33.760]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:37.760]  them heavily at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units,
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:41.760]  but they're really just like new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty,
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:45.760]  and special bonuses you just won't believe. Don't wait. They go fast.
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:49.760]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:55.760]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's

[1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:03.760]  Hey there. Frank Bates here.
[1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:07.760]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:11.760]  million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts
[1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:15.760]  warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:19.760]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich,
[1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:23.760]  wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:27.760]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this. It may be because
[1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:31.760]  the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:35.760]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:39.760]  this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy. Go watch
[1:52:39.760 --> 1:52:43.760]  the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:47.760]  exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family
[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:51.760]  can survive this deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video
[1:52:51.760 --> 1:52:55.760]  will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever. Again,
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.760]  that's weirddevice.com.
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:03.760]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:07.760]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985,
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:11.760]  President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:15.760]  the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:19.760]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:23.760]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your
[1:53:23.760 --> 1:53:27.760]  loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds
[1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:31.760]  that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:35.760]  a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally
[1:53:35.760 --> 1:53:39.760]  wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong
[1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:43.760]  in your body. Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order

[1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:59.760]  Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:03.760]  We've got it.
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:17.760]  We're continuing here on the Alex Jones show. Thank you for joining us. We just
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:21.760]  finished up an interview with Representative Steve Toth from the State of Texas and the
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:25.760]  Firearms Protection Act and I want to reiterate why this matters to
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:29.760]  everybody across the nation and wherever you may be listening from.
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:33.760]  This is a precedent setting bill and it's based on the bill out of
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:37.760]  Wyoming and that really the author of that bill deserves the credit but
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:41.760]  the language of this bill can be shared with many other states and there are lots
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:45.760]  of other states who would like to get on board and stand up to the federal
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:49.760]  government and say enough is enough. We're not going to let our rights be
[1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:53.760]  trampled on any longer because look where this is going
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.760]  folks. If you don't stand up to this
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:01.760]  second amendment is not the end of this. They're going to come after your first amendment. They're going to come after
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:05.760]  your fifth amendment even more than they have already. They're going to obliterate
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:09.760]  states' rights and basically say there shouldn't be any states whatsoever
[1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:13.760]  and with the executive orders Obama's going to be saying well we don't need
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:17.760]  Congress either. What's the point of having Congress when the president just writes law?
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.760]  This is the basis of the downfall
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:25.760]  of our free society and it has already begun. We have already
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:29.760]  started to tumble down that pit of tyranny and oppression
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:33.760]  and if we don't turn back from that right now it's over.
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:37.760]  This is it. So you better get on the phone right now.
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:41.760]  If you're in the state of Texas you better get on the phone, call Attorney General Greg Abbott's
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:45.760]  office and tell him yes you support the full
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:49.760]  on firearms protection act that makes it a felony for
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:53.760]  federal officials to engage in unconstitutional gun restriction in the
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  state of Texas. You better call your state representatives wherever you live and tell
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:01.760]  them introduce the firearms protection act because if you don't draw the
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:05.760]  line right here it's over and let me tell you my personal prediction
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:09.760]  of what I think is coming up. Why
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:13.760]  didn't Obama have a high capacity
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:17.760]  magazine restriction in his executive orders?
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:21.760]  There was all this talk that he was going to do that but he backed off it seems.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:25.760]  He did not do that. Why? Because he has full confidence
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:29.760]  that they're going to be able to get that through Congress through legislation.
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:33.760]  So you have to ask the question then why does he have that confidence
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:37.760]  when right now the mood, the environment
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:41.760]  Congress is saying no to more gun
[1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:45.760]  restrictions in Congress. Why does he have that confidence?
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:49.760]  The answer is because they are planning another major
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  false flag attack in America. A major
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:57.760]  false flag attack. And I'm here to tell you
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:01.760]  independently not even based on
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:05.760]  what Alex said or Info Wars or anybody else but just myself as
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.760]  Mike Adams as an intelligent investigative journalist with no criminal
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:13.760]  record. Absolutely. The cleanest cut guy you'll ever meet.
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  I don't smoke. I don't drink alcohol. I never have consumed alcohol
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:21.760]  just my personal choice. Clean cut guy, super clean record past all the
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:25.760]  FBI background checks, all the ATF checks for class 4 gear. You name it.
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:29.760]  You're not going to find somebody with a cleaner record than myself
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:33.760]  by looking at the data. I am telling you I believe
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:37.760]  that they are going to stage another major false flag attack during
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:41.760]  the debate of gun control restrictions in the US
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:45.760]  Congress. Because they know that if they stage something big enough
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:49.760]  and I'm talking about something like blowing up federal buildings
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:53.760]  more than what we saw in Oklahoma City. Something even perhaps bigger
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:57.760]  than 9-11. I'm talking about perhaps them doing a
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:01.760]  dirty bomb, a radiological attack or a biological attack
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:05.760]  in a major US city and somehow finding some way to blame that on
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:09.760]  Patriots. That's what is coming. So you better
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:13.760]  be ready because if they do that and if they can blame it on Patriots
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:17.760]  and they get the media screaming again and again about how
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:21.760]  the Patriots made this happen and killed a million people in some major city
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:25.760]  they'll declare martial law. There won't be another election. You won't have any
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:29.760]  rights whatsoever and they'll drive America into an all out war and that's what
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:33.760]  they want. So watch out. That's what's coming. Alright, stay with me
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:37.760]  here on The Alex Jones Show. A lot more straight ahead including Dr. Andrew
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:59.760]  Wakefield. We'll be right back. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:27.760]  Welcome to the third hour of The Alex Jones Show. This is Mike Adams
[2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:31.760]  filling in for Alex and I appreciate you joining us today. We've
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:35.760]  got so much on our plates. Things are moving very, very rapidly.
[2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:39.760]  Coming up in the next segment we've got Dr. Andrew Wakefield joining us
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:43.760]  here live in studio here in Austin, Texas to give us the latest
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:47.760]  information on the U.S. vaccine court admitting that
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:51.760]  vaccines cause autism. Plus we're going to get Dr.
[2:00:51.760 --> 2:00:55.760]  Wakefield's take on the new psychiatric police state
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:59.760]  that has just been formed in America by Obama and his 23 executive
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:03.760]  orders. There was an outstanding breakdown of those executive orders
[2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:07.760]  posted, filmed and posted by Aaron Dykes right here on the InfoWars team
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:11.760]  just I think yesterday or the night before that went up. Seven of the
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:15.760]  psychiatry executive orders have something to do with mental health. So you can bet
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:19.760]  they're going to start using psychiatry as a weapon against freedom
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:23.760]  while completely ignoring the fact that psychiatry actually creates violent
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:27.760]  shooters and has been linked to most of these shootings that have taken
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:31.760]  place. So wow, what a total scam, a total racket. They're making
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:35.760]  the problem worse while ignoring the real causes of violence
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:39.760]  in America today. Two things I wanted to cover though real quick before
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:43.760]  bringing Dr. Wakefield in studio. One is that
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:47.760]  you know, you've got Obama and all these people talking about background
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  checks that we need to have universal background checks. Why not have
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:55.760]  universal background checks for presidents? Because let me tell you this
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:59.760]  you know that Obama's birth certificate has I don't know
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  17 layers in Adobe Acrobat. It's
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:07.760]  copied and pasted and the resolution is different in different parts of the document.
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:11.760]  The thing is the total fake, it's so obvious anybody who knows
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:15.760]  Photoshop or Acrobat can see that his birth certificate is a fake.
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:19.760]  Now if you or I submitted a document like that
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:23.760]  as part of a background check to purchase a gun, we would be arrested
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:27.760]  for document fraud. We would be guilty of a felony crime
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:31.760]  for submitting the same type of document which is an obvious fraud that the president
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:35.760]  of our country is using to claim that he's qualified to be president.
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:39.760]  Or that he meets the constitutional requirements.
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.760]  So why not have universal background checks for presidents
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:47.760]  for his cabinet members? Why not have background checks
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  for members of Congress to make sure they can pass a quiz on the Constitution?
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:55.760]  You know what is the 10th amendment? Ask your average
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:59.760]  congressperson in Washington DC and they won't know. They don't
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:03.760]  know what it is or they'll misquote it. They'll say oh the 10th amendment is what gives
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:07.760]  the government the right to regulate all intrastate commerce.
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:11.760]  What? That's not what's written at all. You people would fail. You get an F.
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.760]  You get an F on Liberty, an F on the Constitution. You get an F
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.760]  in Washington on just about everything you're doing today except those few people that are
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:23.760]  standing up. And a big thumbs up to Rand Paul by the way
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.760]  for his comments on saying that we don't want a king in America today.
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:31.760]  We've had enough of kings running our lives.
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:35.760]  So enough of the kingship. One other comment here before
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:39.760]  we get into the next segment. Lance Armstrong.
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:43.760]  I wrote an article about Lance Armstrong. It's posted on Infowars.com
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:47.760]  right now. He came out last night and Oprah
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:51.760]  who's trying to save her network from terrible ratings had Lance
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  Armstrong on to have a staged confession during
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.760]  which Lance Armstrong admitted that he's been lying all
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:03.760]  along. He doped with EPO. He doped with
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  testosterone. He doped with his own blood injecting it back into his veins. I mean that
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:11.760]  guy was not on a bike unless he had a needle in his veins before.
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:15.760]  I mean all the tour de France races he said he doped
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:19.760]  to win those races. And in the interview he didn't even think that it was
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:23.760]  cheating. He just said oh it's just leveling the playing field. I mean the guy has
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:27.760]  no remorse. He bullied people. He threatened people. He filed lawsuits against
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:31.760]  a long list of whistleblowers who were trying to speak
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.760]  out. And now he goes on Oprah and wants us to forgive him.
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:39.760]  Dude we don't forgive you. Why don't you give the money back to all the people
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:43.760]  whose careers that you ruined or destroyed or threatened with your
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:47.760]  lawsuits. Why don't you give them the money that you gained by cheating
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  in sport. Why don't you do that and then we might forgive
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:55.760]  you. That's my comment on Lance Armstrong. Stay with us. We'll be back after
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:59.760]  this break with Dr. Andrew Wakefield in studio.
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:49.760]  The police state isn't coming.

[2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:09.760]  In the councils of government we must guard against
[2:08:09.760 --> 2:08:13.760]  the acquisition of unwanted influence whether sought or
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:17.760]  unsought by the military industrial complex.
[2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:21.760]  In Dallas, Texas three shots were fired at President Kennedy's
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:25.760]  raid in downtown Dallas. The first reports say that
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:29.760]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:33.760]  It is a big idea. A new order.
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:37.760]  It was almost as if it were a planned
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:41.760]  invasion. It just banked.
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  Either you were with us
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:49.760]  or you were with the terrorists.
[2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:53.760]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that
[2:08:53.760 --> 2:08:57.760]  AK-47s belong in hands of soldiers not in hands of criminals.
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:01.760]  Guns will be taken.
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:05.760]  No one will be able to be off and take off.
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:09.760]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:13.760]  to do this in an American city for the
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:19.760]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  Global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge.
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  But are we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:31.760]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:38.760]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:42.760]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:47.760]  This is Mike Adams, the editor of naturalnews.com, filling in for Alex today.
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:53.760]  And in studio, joining me now for the rest of this hour is none other than Dr. Andrew Wakefield
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:10:00.760]  with some breaking news on the US Vaccine Court and its recent decision tying vaccines to autism
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:04.760]  without any question whatsoever. So he'll be breaking that down for us in some detail.
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:10.760]  Also, we're going to get Dr. Wakefield's take on some of the possible implications
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:15.760]  of the recent executive orders focused on mental health and psychiatry.
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:20.760]  And I've even got a copy of the Psychiatry Bible, so to speak, here with me.
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:25.760]  And we're going to cover oppositional defiance disorder, ODD,
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:30.760]  which is actually in the Psychiatry Manual, even though people said I made that up.
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:34.760]  I didn't make it up, and I'm going to show it to you in the book as we continue here.
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:39.760]  Plus, we're going to be taking your calls, so if you've got a question for Dr. Wakefield,
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:43.760]  I'd like to take your call, go ahead and call, it's 888, isn't it? No, 800.
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:50.760]  I'm sorry, 800-259-9231 if you've got a question on psychiatry or Dr. Wakefield.
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:56.760]  If you called earlier for Paul Watson's guest or Representative Tooth,
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:01.760]  we're going to have to drop you and take new calls on psychiatry and questions for Dr. Wakefield.
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:04.760]  So, go ahead and clear the board, guys, and let new people call back in.
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:08.760]  And I apologize if you were on hold, but things are moving very quickly.
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:12.760]  So, Dr. Wakefield, welcome to the Alice Jones Show. It's good to have you in studio again.
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:14.760]  It's great to be back. Thank you.
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:19.760]  Well, a lot has been happening since the last time we spoke right here in the same spot.
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:27.760]  You've got the British Medical Journal still has not retracted their slanderous statements about you and your research.
[2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:29.760]  Is there any update on that front?
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:36.760]  Yes, Brian Deer and the editor of the British Medical Journal and the BMJ themselves are being sued here in the state of Texas.
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:39.760]  We're going through a jurisdictional battle at the moment.
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:42.760]  They're saying you don't have the right to sue us here in Texas.
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:46.760]  This is a British journalist, but we do.
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:51.760]  There's a long arm statute and they sell their wares and make a profit out of Texas.
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:58.760]  So, on the technical aspects of this, we're confident in winning and getting Brian Deer here before a Texas jury.
[2:11:58.760 --> 2:11:59.760]  And that is the key.
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:02.760]  Really, Brian Deer might be here in Austin, Texas?
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:03.760]  That is what this is all about.
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:10.760]  I want the American people to see and judge this man for themselves and to judge the quality and the veracity of his story.
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:12.760]  And they will see how flawed he really is.
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:21.760]  Or he could just remain a fugitive from justice, I guess, and refuse to come and what you might have to go into extradition proceedings in the UK, or how would that even work?
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:29.760]  Well, it's interesting and it's probably a technical aspect of law, but I would imagine that we would then file a case in England and he would then be in contempt of the UK courts.
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:30.760]  But that's another matter.
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:33.760]  The BMJ themselves have to come because they sell here.
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:39.760]  This is one of their outlets, so they're obliged if we win the jurisdictional battle.
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  Well, excellent. I appreciate your veracity, your dedication to pursuing this and not allowing them to just steamroll you with their slanderous, completely false analysis.
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:55.760]  I mean, they literally just invented things about your research that they pulled out of thin air.
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:57.760]  Yeah, I know what the problem here, Mike, is so much bigger.
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:08.760]  As you probably know, there is an increasing level of attack on scientists and physicians who are acting in the best interests of their patients and not in the best interests of the government or the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:20.760]  And there is a relentless assault on the few, perhaps five, ten scientists in the world who are prepared to work on the possible association between vaccines and childhood developmental disorders like autism.
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:29.760]  And if we do not protect those scientists and doctors, then you're going to find nobody who's prepared to stand up in vaccine court to protect these children because that's the end of their career.
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:38.760]  You're going to find no scientist who's prepared to do the valid safety science on vaccines because it'll be the end of their career. They'll lose their grants. They'll lose everything just as I did.
[2:13:38.760 --> 2:13:47.760]  And so we have got to stand up as a body, as scientists, as a community, as a people and say these people are valuable and need to be protected. And that is exactly what we're doing here.
[2:13:47.760 --> 2:13:55.760]  Well said. This is about the integrity of science. I mean, this is not a personal revenge attack on branded.
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:01.760]  It's so much more important than that. And the community actually said to me, Andy, we need to fight this case.
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  We will raise the capital to help you because, as you know, Mike, justice belongs to those who can afford it.
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:11.760]  So we need to take this battle to them in the U.S. court.
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:20.760]  Well, let's talk about the U.S. vaccine court now. Also, there's been significant breaking news that you brought to my attention, an article published at HuffPost.
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:25.760]  Vaccine court awards millions to two children with autism.
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:33.760]  The court has made the determination that there is a causal link between vaccinations and the development of autism in those children.
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:36.760]  And they were given an award. Give us a breakdown of that story.
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:43.760]  Well, this is fascinating. It's huge. It's a game changer. And it comes on the back of an Italian decision in the Rimini court, which made an identical decision.
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:54.760]  There was a child who was developing perfectly normally in Italy who had the MMR and regressed into autism. He developed all the typical characteristics that we described originally in Lancet, including gastrointestinal symptoms,
[2:14:54.760 --> 2:15:02.760]  encephalopathy, in other words, generalized brain dysfunction, and his final diagnosis was autism. They settled that case in Italy.
[2:15:02.760 --> 2:15:08.760]  The government, importantly, did not fight it. They agreed that the MMR had caused his autism.
[2:15:08.760 --> 2:15:14.760]  It's on the basis that they do not make MMR vaccination mandatory in Italy.
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:19.760]  Whereas the judge said, no, sorry, you put so much pressure on parents to have this vaccine. You are to blame now.
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:24.760]  We have this ruling in the U.S. Vaccine Court where you have exactly the same sequence of events.
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:30.760]  Normally developing children get the MMR plus another vaccine in each case of these two children.
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:41.760]  They then regress into, they have this encephalopathy, a rash, a fever, loss of language, loss of speech, loss of interaction with their siblings, and a regression into autism.
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:54.760]  They are linked. And what this brings to the public attention once and for all is that the American Vaccine Court, the Department of Justice, have been hiding behind the vaccine court for so long.
[2:15:54.760 --> 2:16:03.760]  Behind their table injuries. Now we have a clear sequence of events which links vaccines MMR in particular to autism.
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:12.760]  All right, if you're just joining us, this is the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams filling in an interview with Dr. Andrew Wakefield live here in studio in Austin, Texas.
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  And a lot of breaking news on the vaccine front. Now, we published a story not too long ago, Dr. Wakefield, where the CDC admits on their website,
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:32.760]  and we took a screenshot, quoted their information, they admit that vaccines contain mercury, aluminum, MSG, monosodium glutamate, and formaldehyde.
[2:16:32.760 --> 2:16:43.760]  Now, these four substances, should any doctor in any circumstance ever inject a child with aluminum, mercury, MSG, or formaldehyde?
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:51.760]  No, it would be unthinkable. If you took these substances on their own and gave them to someone, you would face criminal prosecution, and yet they're saying that this is safe.
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:17:00.760]  No, it isn't. It's never been tested for safety. We've just got a recent report from the Institute of Medicine saying that there is a parless lack of information on vaccine safety science,
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:06.760]  both in terms of the schedule, the dose that children get and when they get it. We simply do not know. There is no science.
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:13.760]  And so if people are telling the public that vaccines are safe because they've been shown to be safe, that is not true.
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:25.760]  Right, right, exactly. But it brings up the question, why won't the CDC, the FDA, and the pro-vaccine doctors out there, why won't they say, let's make a clean vaccine?
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:31.760]  Let's make clean vaccines with no mercury, no thimerosol, no MSG, no formaldehyde, nothing.
[2:17:31.760 --> 2:17:39.760]  Just single-dose vials, right, so they don't need a preservative because they're not used for multiple doses. Why won't they do that?
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:47.760]  There are two parts to this answer, Mike, in my opinion, and one of them is accountability. If you make a change, then it's a tacit admission that there was a problem with the vaccine that you had before.
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:50.760]  So they'd rather keep harming children rather than fix the problem.
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:55.760]  That seems to be the case. And the other problem, Mike, is that they don't want the public to lose confidence.
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:18:01.760]  The vaccine schedule, the vaccine policy of any country depends upon the compliance of the populace.
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:07.760]  In other words, people having enough confidence in the vaccine regulators to say, yes, we'll take your word for it.
[2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:15.760]  And if that goes, then it's to try to cross the board. People will lose confidence in vaccines right across the board, and we will have problems.
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:18.760]  Well, they are losing confidence in vaccines.
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:29.760]  No, Mike, they've lost it. They've lost it. 89% of American parents in a recent study from University of Michigan said that vaccine safety science was their number one medical research priority.
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:37.760]  89% of parents. So the majority of parents have major concerns. They do not believe the CDC. They do not believe what their pediatrician is telling them.
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:46.760]  They're saying in their communities, on their streets, in their schools, so many children who are being damaged by these vaccines with autism at the spearhead of all this,
[2:18:46.760 --> 2:18:49.760]  that they do not believe what they're being told.
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:57.760]  And it's obvious that they damaged children. I mean, I remember even Donald Trump said on the air a couple of months ago that his employees had perfectly healthy children,
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:04.760]  took them in to the pediatrician, they got vaccinated, the next morning lights are out, the child's autistic.
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:13.760]  And it happens to people over and over and over again. There is a temporal correlation between getting the vaccine and getting autism.
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:19.760]  How can the scientific community even call itself scientific if it dismisses all of this powerful evidence?
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:28.760]  It is extraordinary to me. Clinically, it is so obvious. My job as a physician and a scientist is to look for patterns in disease, patterns in clinical presentation,
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:34.760]  and the pattern here is so common, so similar, and it's exactly as you heard in these court settlements.
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:43.760]  Normal child vaccine, prolonged fever, rash, debilitation, the child goes downhill, their immune system goes to pieces, and they are never the same again.
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:47.760]  Hold that thought, Dr. Wakefield. We're going to continue after this break. This is the Alex Jones show.
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:20:05.760]  In an interview with Dr. Andrew Wakefield, we'll be right back after this break with more, plus your calls, so don't go away. We'll be right back.
[2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:40.760]  We need your help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:50.760]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[2:20:50.760 --> 2:21:00.760]  The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[2:21:00.760 --> 2:21:06.760]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:15.760]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:22.760]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:30.760]  Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:35.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why bank stock workers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:41.760]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[2:22:41.760 --> 2:22:44.760]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:49.760]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:55.760]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:26.760]  All right, and we are back on the Alex Jones show. Thank you for joining us. We are continuing our interview here in studio with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:33.760]  Yes, the Dr. Wakefield, the champion of academic integrity when it comes to scientific integrity, actually more importantly,
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:43.760]  when it comes to vaccines and investigating with a sense of scientific skepticism, what could be the links between vaccines and childhood development disorders
[2:24:43.760 --> 2:24:49.760]  such as autism but not limited to autism, and Dr. Wakefield continues with us in the studio right now.
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:58.760]  Dr. Wakefield, what kinds of... I want to get the word out about how people can help support your efforts because this is an important victory.
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:01.760]  And you mentioned a website during the break. Can you give that out on the air?
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:07.760]  Certainly. In order to protect doctors and scientists who are acting in the interest of their patients but who are being attacked
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:15.760]  by whatever mainstream medicine is, by the pharmaceutical industry, by the media, because they are not complying with the rules
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:23.760]  that protect the stock price of various pharmaceutical products, then what we've done is to set up what we call the Academic Integrity Fund.
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:30.760]  Academicintegrityfund.org, and this is a fund that people can pay into which will protect the legal rights,
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:35.760]  will allow the people who are coming under attack to fight back, whether it's in the courts or elsewhere.
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:42.760]  And it's starting with my case right here in Texas in an attempt to get Brian Deere and the British Medical Journal in front of a Texas jury.
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:50.760]  And are there... I know it takes money to fight for justice, big time. Are there some attorneys also doing some pro bono work as part of it
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:52.760]  or discounted work?
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:59.760]  I have an outstanding group of attorneys who are working at a discounted rate because they believe very strongly in the merits of this case.
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:05.760]  Well, I'm going to make a donation, by the way. I've been doing a lot of donations lately. I donated to Gun Owners of America.
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:11.760]  I gave $500 to that group. I just... Larry Pratt, you rock! I gave him $500. I'm going to donate to your group.
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:19.760]  Academicintegrityfund.org is the web address. We've got to put the money where it matters. I call that revenue activism.
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:24.760]  So we take money from our store sales and we just push it into all these things that need support.
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  But thank you for mentioning that website. But continuing on, what do you think about this flu, so-called flu pandemic,
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:38.760]  almost a fear-mongering thing the CDC is doing right now, saying, oh, the flu is terrible. Everybody should go get vaccinated.
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:41.760]  Isn't that too simplistic of an answer?
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:46.760]  We've seen this time and time again, Mike, and I'm not an expert on flu vaccine, but I do know that, for example,
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:53.760]  flu mutates at a phenomenally fast rate, so predicting which vaccine is going to work against the current flu is such a hit and miss affair.
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:27:00.760]  We've seen from analyses, detailed, comprehensive, scientific analyses of all the data on flu vaccine around the world
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:07.760]  in the Cochrane Review that these vaccines, their benefit is minimal at best and restricted to certain groups,
[2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:11.760]  not seen in high-risk groups, and therefore there is no merit in those high-risk groups,
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:17.760]  and the Canadians showing that if you get the flu after being vaccinated, because it does not work well,
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:22.760]  then it is worse. You develop a more severe pattern of disease, but you have been vaccinated.
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:27.760]  The CDC, which I am convinced, just invents numbers out of thin air.
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:33.760]  I mean, they just pull these out of their hats, and they say if you get the vaccine, your flu will be less severe,
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:38.760]  but they have absolutely no data to back that up, and they say the vaccine is now, I think they're quoting,
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:43.760]  it's 62% effective. That number has no basis in anything. They make it up.
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:48.760]  I'm sure they do, and they have the ability to make a sowsie out of a silk purse at the CDC,
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:52.760]  and I think that's what they've done here. They've made numbers up for so long.
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:56.760]  What are we to believe? And when you hear these numbers about the people who've had to go to the hospital
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:59.760]  because they've got flu, how many of those people were vaccinated?
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:05.760]  Were they part of that group that the Canadians say are going to be worse if they get the flu after having been vaccinated?
[2:28:05.760 --> 2:28:07.760]  We don't know. We're not told.
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:13.760]  I did a little bit of a survey on that, and I found that about two-thirds in my group of friends and employees and so on,
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:18.760]  about two-thirds of the people who went to the hospital with influenza,
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:22.760]  I'm not talking about my employees. They're typically healthy, but people they know, you know,
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:25.760]  two-thirds of them have been vaccinated against the flu.
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:30.760]  So how can that be if the flu works? I mean, if the flu vaccine works,
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:35.760]  then how can two-thirds of the people in the hospital with the flu be people who got vaccinated?
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:37.760]  It's not logical.
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:44.760]  There's something very bad going wrong here, and the idea that you're going to give mercury-containing flu vaccines to pregnant women
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:48.760]  and to children over the age of six months, this is unacceptable.
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:55.760]  Tell me about when you were trained in med school, weren't you taught never to give a vaccine to a pregnant woman?
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:00.760]  Absolutely. I mean, you never gave anything to a pregnant woman unless absolutely necessary.
[2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:01.760]  No antidepressants?
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:04.760]  Absolutely. You've got a very, very vulnerable fetus there.
[2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:08.760]  All of these compounds are sequestered. They're taken up preferentially into the fetus.
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:10.760]  The fetus does not have the ability to get rid of them.
[2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:15.760]  For example, mercury. If you give a mother mercury, that mercury is going to get into the fetus,
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:18.760]  and it cannot, it doesn't have the excretion mechanisms to get rid of it.
[2:29:18.760 --> 2:29:19.760]  Right.
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:20.760]  So it's going to accumulate.
[2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:24.760]  But the CDC and the vaccine pushers, they engage in what I might call magical thinking,
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:27.760]  where they say the mercury doesn't harm you because we say it doesn't.
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:31.760]  We wave a magic wand, we do a little voodoo, a big pharma profit voodoo,
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:33.760]  and suddenly the mercury is safe.
[2:29:33.760 --> 2:29:34.760]  Magical.
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:36.760]  And they've said the science shows that the science is in.
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:40.760]  Two years ago, the paper came out showing that 74% of the published science shows that
[2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:44.760]  there is an association between heavy metal containing vaccines and autism.
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:47.760]  All right. Well said, Dr. Wakefield. We'll be right back here on The Alex Jones Show
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:49.760]  and your calls straight ahead.
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:53.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:29:57.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:57.760 --> 2:30:03.760]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:09.760]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[2:30:09.760 --> 2:30:13.760]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:15.760]  Check out Simply Safe.

[2:33:07.760 --> 2:33:10.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:10.760 --> 2:33:23.760]  Welcome back, your calls straight ahead as we continue our interview with Dr. Andrew Wakefield right here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:27.760]  This is Mike Adams, the editor of NaturalNews.com filling in.
[2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:31.760]  I guess I am, as Alex called me, the unofficial crew member around here.
[2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:36.760]  I come in and fill in from time to time whenever I'm needed for that purpose.
[2:33:36.760 --> 2:33:41.760]  And Dr. Wakefield, once again, thank you for being here, hope you're ready to take some calls.
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:42.760]  Are you good?
[2:33:42.760 --> 2:33:43.760]  Absolutely, I'm ready to go.
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:44.760]  Alright, you got your earpiece in?
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:45.760]  Yep.
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:46.760]  You ready to go?
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:47.760]  I'm good.
[2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:48.760]  Alright, let's do it.
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:49.760]  Let's go to Greg in Utah.
[2:33:49.760 --> 2:33:51.760]  Greg, you're on the air with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:52.760]  Welcome to the show.
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:53.760]  Thank you.
[2:33:53.760 --> 2:34:02.760]  You know, there was a small health, natural health company here that was exposing all this information on a daily basis.
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:06.760]  And the FTCs went after them, it was called Daniel Chapter 1.
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:07.760]  Oh, yeah.
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:13.760]  And basically, if they attacked their First Amendment rights and if they were to say anything about this anymore,
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:15.760]  they're basically going to put them in prison.
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:17.760]  So they ended their radio program.
[2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:19.760]  You know, we need the support of the people.
[2:34:19.760 --> 2:34:23.760]  That's the problem is they're killing the messenger.
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:26.760]  You know, they're going after the messenger and they're doing it.
[2:34:26.760 --> 2:34:31.760]  I mean, the Federal Trade Commission is who went after them, not the CDC.
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:33.760]  You know, I'm very familiar with that case.
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:34.760]  That's a good point.
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:40.760]  Daniel Chapter 1 was actually a ministry and they sold some cancer therapies, herbal.
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:46.760]  And they dared to go on the air and to say that, you know, some of these herbs are mentioned in the Bible and they, you know,
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:48.760]  they can actually help you heal from cancer.
[2:34:48.760 --> 2:34:50.760]  And yeah, the FTC came after them.
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:53.760]  What do you see happening, Dr. Wakefield, and thank you caller for your call.
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:35:05.760]  What do you see happening with attacks on the First Amendment rights of people who are attempting to raise awareness among the public of alternative or holistic healing therapies?
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:14.760]  There are myriad cases of local health authorities, local regulators going after alternative practitioners.
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:16.760]  I mean, these attacks are going on all the time.
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.760]  In fact, Texas is probably one of the worst states in the country for that.
[2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:21.760]  The state medical board.
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:22.760]  Absolutely.
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:23.760]  And Dr. Brzezinski.
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:24.760]  Absolutely.
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:25.760]  A classic example.
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:26.760]  Yeah.
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:32.760]  Where I gather that they've now tried, the FDA are trying to get the patent on his products, you know, having attacked him for years.
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:34.760]  Now, that's what I've heard through the grapevine.
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:35.760]  Yeah.
[2:35:35.760 --> 2:35:39.760]  Whether it's true or not, it would be a wonderful irony to conclude that story as long as he comes out of it.
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:47.760]  Well, one of the greatest groups guilty of biopiracy is Big Pharma.
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:56.760]  They will attack an herb and say it's useless, it's useless, it's useless, and then they will steal a molecule from that herb, like turmeric, for example.
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:00.760]  They'll modify it, patent it, and then say, this is the best drug ever.
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:01.760]  Oh, yeah.
[2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:09.760]  They're in the jungles now, collecting a number of plants and herbs that they believe may be the future to their success because they've run out of other things apart from vaccines to profit from.
[2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:13.760]  But the biggest impact I see is in the media.
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:23.760]  You know, here we have a case where a classic case, a groundbreaking case, two cases where the vaccine called awards for children who develop autism following MMR vaccine.
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:25.760]  It's picked up by the UK media.
[2:36:25.760 --> 2:36:26.760]  It's reported there.
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:28.760]  Not a single word in the mainstream media.
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:29.760]  Why?
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:33.760]  Because their revenues derive from advertising dollars from the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:46.760]  And that was a 1997 decision, I believe, from the FDA that legalized pharmaceutical advertising on mainstream television because before that it was illegal and it remains illegal in most every other nation around the world.
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:50.760]  And what they did, Mike, is I think quite a smart thing is that they paid a lot of money.
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:53.760]  And so that the media became dependent on their income.
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:59.760]  You know, it's like you kind of ramp things up according to the income that you get and then you can't do without it.
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:01.760]  And so suddenly they've got them right where they want them.
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:03.760]  Got them.
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:04.760]  Yeah.
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:05.760]  We'll just leave it at that.
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  All right, let's go to the next call.
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:08.760]  Rob in Texas, you're on the air.
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:09.760]  Rob, go ahead.
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  What's your question, sir?
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:12.760]  Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:17.760]  My statement actually speaks to psychiatric tyranny that I see and to vaccines.
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:21.760]  My son, who is on the spectrum with Aspergers, was vaccinated.
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:24.760]  He has depression and sometimes anger issues.
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:25.760]  We take him to see a counselor.
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:28.760]  We were going to take him to see a child psychiatrist.
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:31.760]  And so my wife was getting that set up.
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:34.760]  He asked her, you know, do you have insurance?
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:36.760]  She naively says, well, yes.
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:37.760]  What kind?
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:38.760]  Okay, we accept that.
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:40.760]  She goes, but we want to pay for this out of pocket.
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:42.760]  He says, no, you can't do that.
[2:37:42.760 --> 2:37:46.760]  If we accept your insurance, do they have to pay or it's insurance fraud?
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:47.760]  This is new.
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:49.760]  You can't pay cash.
[2:37:49.760 --> 2:37:51.760]  No, they wouldn't let us pay cash.
[2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:53.760]  Needless to say, we didn't book an appointment.
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:54.760]  Yeah.
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:55.760]  Well, well, good question, Rob.
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:56.760]  Go ahead.
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:37:58.760]  There's a big issue, several big issues here.
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:04.760]  Actually, one is are the origins of your child's anger and violence
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:08.760]  or aggressive issues due to underlying pain or discomfort.
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:11.760]  One thing we've discovered, in fact, we reported years and years ago,
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:14.760]  15 years ago, is these children have an inflammatory bowel disease in many cases.
[2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:18.760]  And that is a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms, constipation,
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:22.760]  diarrhea, alternating constipation and diarrhea, pain, kids in pain,
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:23.760]  sudden outbursts of anger.
[2:38:23.760 --> 2:38:26.760]  And when you correct that abdominal inflammation, that intestinal inflammation,
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:27.760]  all that goes away.
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:33.760]  In other words, is there a need for a reappraisal of children for medical problems,
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:34.760]  underlying medical problems?
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:40.760]  Do they not need to be on pharmaceutical agents for anger and depression at all?
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:41.760]  And that's my belief.
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:42.760]  Very good.
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:43.760]  The source of problems.
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:44.760]  Point, yeah.
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:49.760]  If someone has chronic, ongoing pain in digestive pain or even musculoskeletal pain,
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:52.760]  whatever the case may be, you know, they're going to be kind of crabby
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:54.760]  or maybe depressed in a bad mood.
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:55.760]  That's not a psychiatric problem.
[2:38:55.760 --> 2:38:57.760]  That's a physiological problem.
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:01.760]  It's absolutely essential to rule out physiological medical problems
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:04.760]  before you resort to the belief that this is a psychiatric problem
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:09.760]  and then put them on major medications, which may have any number of adverse effects
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:14.760]  and for what are not indicated for autism or Aspergist disorders in these children.
[2:39:14.760 --> 2:39:16.760]  So there may be an alternative approach.
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:17.760]  Mike, is it Mike?
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:18.760]  Yeah.
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:19.760]  No, sorry.
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:20.760]  No, the man on the phone.
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:21.760]  Rob.
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:22.760]  What are you, my name?
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:23.760]  Yeah, I'm Mike.
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:24.760]  What are you?
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:25.760]  You forgot me already.
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:26.760]  What's going on?
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:30.760]  So Rob, if there are, you know, if there are underlying symptoms that might be corrected,
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:33.760]  please bear that in mind and take that approach first.
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:34.760]  All right.
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:35.760]  Very good.
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:36.760]  Very good question, Rob.
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:37.760]  Thank you for your call.
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:38.760]  And by the way, here, overhead cam shot.
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:44.760]  This is the DSM right here, DSM for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:48.760]  the so-called Bible of modern psychiatry.
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:49.760]  And check it out.
[2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:54.760]  Page 100, Oppositional Defiant Disorder.
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:56.760]  Oppositional Defiant Disorder right here.
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:39:57.760]  There we go.
[2:39:57.760 --> 2:39:58.760]  Get it in view.
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:00.520]  Check this out, Dr. Wakefield.
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:04.960]  You can be diagnosed with this, and I imagine you and I have both been, quote, diagnosed
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:11.760]  with this by simply disagreeing with someone in a position of authority because it's written
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:12.760]  right in here.
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:17.760]  Oh, and there are probably drugs that they can, oh, look, often argues with adults.
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:21.760]  That would be something that's in the First Amendment, I think.
[2:40:21.760 --> 2:40:23.760]  Often blames others for his or her mistakes.
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:24.760]  Well, I wouldn't do that.
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:26.760]  But easily annoyed by others.
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:29.760]  I'm annoyed by liberals who are trying to take away our rights.
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:31.760]  I'm easily annoyed by gun grabbers.
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:34.760]  I don't know who you're annoyed by.
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:37.760]  Journal editors who slandered you.
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:38.760]  How long have we gone?
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:39.760]  Yeah.
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:40.760]  Well, anyway, there it is.
[2:40:40.760 --> 2:40:41.760]  It's real, folks.
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:42.760]  People said I made this up.
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.760]  No, it's right there, and there are a couple of people starting from it right in this room.
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:47.760]  Exactly.
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:51.760]  I think that manual, it underlies everything that's wrong with this disorder.
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:53.760]  Particularly autistic spectrum disorders.
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:57.760]  The worst thing is that it ever turned at the hands of child psychiatrists, I'm afraid.
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:01.760]  That's my opinion, and it's one I strongly, strongly believe.
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:05.760]  And what we see is a revision of this document time and time again, DSM, when they should
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:06.760]  be focusing on the real issue.
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:08.760]  What is driving this epidemic of autism?
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:12.760]  For a child born today, the risk of an autistic spectrum disorder is going to be one in 25.
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:13.760]  That is unacceptable.
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:19.760]  And what you find is the psychiatric, psychology community spend their time revising this document.
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:23.760]  Not everyone, but a lot of people focus on this, and it's a displacement activity.
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:26.760]  It's moving away from what is really essential about this.
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:30.760]  How do you stop this epidemic, and how do you treat kids effectively who've already got it?
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:31.760]  You know what this reminds me of?
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  I mean, look at this manual.
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:33.760]  This thing is huge.
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:34.760]  I mean, check this out.
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:35.760]  That's how big it is.
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:37.760]  It's a massive, thick manual, and it's getting bigger in version 5.
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:42.760]  All they do is they observe a lot of nutritional deficiencies, a lot of underlying problems,
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:43.760]  and they give it a bunch of different names.
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:48.760]  This is like physicists looking for the God particle and naming all the little things
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:52.760]  they spot in the supercliders saying, oh, that's the Muon, that's the Gluon, that's the Blueon,
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:53.760]  whatever they name it.
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:58.760]  It's like, no, people, there's one unified theory underneath all this.
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:01.760]  You're just naming things to try to make it sound scientific.
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:07.760]  There's really only a couple of basic core fundamental physiological truths or physical
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:08.760]  truths underneath all this.
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:12.760]  Yeah, one of the great truths, Mike, is you go back and you talk to the mother.
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:14.760]  What happened to your child?
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:17.760]  And mothers have got to trust in their instincts because their instincts are the reason we're
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:21.760]  on this earth at the moment, not the DSM manual, so that can go in the trash.
[2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:22.760]  All right, let's trash it.
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:23.760]  There it goes.
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:24.760]  Off.
[2:42:24.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  Off.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:26.760]  And say, what happened to your child?
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:27.760]  Very good.
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:28.760]  Let's take another call.
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:32.760]  I'm getting excited here because I'm suffering from oppositional defiant disorder.
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:36.760]  Jesse, from New Orleans, you are on the air with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:37.760]  Jesse, welcome to the show.
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:39.760]  Mike, how are you doing?
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:41.760]  I'm doing great, man.
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:49.760]  So right in line with your conversation about the DSM, I was a victim of doctors who basically
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:50.760]  use that book as their Bible.
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:58.760]  When I was a kid, my parents made me go see a therapist and I basically started making
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:04.760]  things up based on what I was reading, you know, as diagnosis for certain things.
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:10.760]  And Michael Crichton is a terminal man and basically just started telling him I was having all the
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:12.760]  symptoms that the main character in that book had.
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:13.760]  Really?
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:15.760]  And they completely took my word for it.
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:18.760]  So what were you diagnosed with?
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:23.760]  A psychiatrist who then gave me some medication and then they inevitably I started telling
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:26.760]  them I was hearing voices even though I wasn't.
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:29.760]  And because, you know, the game, it was fun for me, I was 13.
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:31.760]  So they admitted me.
[2:43:31.760 --> 2:43:37.760]  And by the time I was all said and done, I was on, well, butchering when it first came
[2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:43.760]  out, depicote, nobbing, and they would give me thwarting whenever I acted up.
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:48.320]  So and also probably those records could then be used against you now to deny you access
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:50.760]  to purchasing a firearm also.
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:54.760]  I was a minor and interestingly enough, I was still allowed to join the military at 17.
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:56.760]  So you figure that out.
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:04.760]  And beyond that, my kids, I have two twin boys that were born eight months ago, seven
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:05.760]  weeks premature.
[2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:09.760]  And of course, they were the whole time my wife was pregnant.
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:11.760]  You know, you need to double up on your flu vaccine.
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:13.760]  You need to do all this and that and the other thing.
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:15.760]  And I was like, no, we're not doing that.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:19.760]  So were you able to keep her protected from vaccines during pregnancy?
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:24.760]  Well, I've exposed her to a lot of your research and, you know, Alex's research and all that
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:26.760]  I've shown her the numbers.
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:30.760]  And one of the greatest things after the kids were born, I was able to, you know, read up
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:31.760]  on a lot of different things.
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:35.760]  And I showed the doctors because, you know, you can never get a doctor when you need one,
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  but you know, you tell them, you don't want the kids to have the vaccines.
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:41.760]  You'll see everybody in the whole hospital.
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:45.760]  And they started showing us all this documentation.
[2:44:45.760 --> 2:44:50.760]  And I was like, well, you know, I'm reading here that there's a fund that the government
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:54.760]  has for families who have adverse side effects from vaccinations.
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:45:00.760]  How many incidents do you think have to happen before the federal government put the fund together like that?
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:01.760]  Good question, Jesse.
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:02.760]  Thank you for your call.
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:07.760]  Dr. Wakefield, let's talk about the pressure that physicians and even physicians,
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:14.760]  physicians assistants and so on put on new moms to be injected even before childbirth,
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:20.760]  during childbirth and after childbirth, even the medicalization of childbirth in our country today,
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:22.760]  what's around the world, all of Western medicine.
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:28.760]  Well, Mike, any pressure, any pressure at all in the absence of informed consent and adequate
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:31.760]  safety studies is too much.
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:35.760]  There is huge pressure and there are no safety studies, particularly of giving the vaccines
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:40.760]  to mothers during pregnancy where it's been specifically contraindicated in the past.
[2:45:40.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  Yeah, causes stillbirth or causes spontaneous abortions.
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:46.760]  Yeah, and there is no informed consent.
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:51.760]  A friend of mine went for a vaccine, in fact, to go into nursing school the other day,
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:54.760]  and she was given two MMRs just a month apart.
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:58.760]  There's never, ever, ever, ever been a safety study of that procedure when asked,
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:03.760]  why should I have a second MMR after the first one just a month ago?
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:06.760]  And she said, well, the month's vaccine doesn't work.
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:07.760]  Therefore, you need another one.
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:11.760]  And why do I have to have measles and rebeller at the same time?
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:15.760]  You can see this kind of pharmaceutical industry, just because that's all they've got,
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:17.760]  because that's all they're prepared to manufacture.
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:20.760]  Well, and also, what about veterinary medicine?
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:25.760]  Because if the theory behind vaccines is that you inject your dog with a vaccine
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:28.760]  and the dog's body builds antibodies to that vaccine,
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:31.760]  why do you get a card or an email from your vet every year?
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:35.760]  Oh, your dog needs the same vaccine again every year.
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:38.760]  I thought the theory was that the antibodies are there.
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.760]  They don't go away, at least not, I mean, they're not supposed to.
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:46.760]  You're supposed to build a database, your immune system database, right?
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:50.760]  Yeah, you could argue that your immune system database needs boosting every so often,
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:52.760]  but there's no science on this.
[2:46:52.760 --> 2:46:56.760]  When they introduced MMR in the UK, the minister who was responsible said,
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:46:58.760]  this is one dose for life.
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:00.760]  Okay, so people believed them, and so people did it.
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:02.760]  What happened is they found it didn't work.
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:06.760]  Neither the measles nor the mumps vaccine lasted for very long,
[2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:09.760]  so now it's two doses, three doses.
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:12.760]  Soon we're going to be on this treadmill of having to have these vaccines every year
[2:47:12.760 --> 2:47:13.760]  because they do not work.
[2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:15.760]  In other words, here's the irony.
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:19.760]  Particularly for mumps vaccine, the vaccine is successful for the pharmaceutical industry
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:21.760]  precisely because it doesn't work.
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:24.760]  And the volume of sales goes up dramatically.
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:27.760]  That's exactly it, because when people go get the mumps vaccine,
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:31.760]  they have a false sense of security thinking they're protected from the mumps
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:35.760]  and they might thereby not take other precautions such as boosting vitamin D intake,
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:40.760]  which is very powerful for preventing mumps and many other infectious diseases.
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:41.760]  So you're right.
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:45.760]  The vaccine's not working is what makes themselves so well,
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:48.760]  and it allows the CDC to put out another fear-mongering announcement.
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:50.760]  Oh, there's another epidemic of mumps.
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:53.760]  Better go get vaccinated even though it doesn't work.
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:56.760]  That's right, and we're seeing that mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations now
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  precisely because it doesn't work.
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:01.760]  And it was a vaccine that was never needed in the first place.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:04.760]  Not my word, the CDC's word and the Department of Health in England.
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:07.760]  Why doesn't the media, I mean, I guess we already know the answer,
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:11.760]  but it's just, it's a shame the media never ever reports
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:13.760]  that in every outbreak they cover,
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:15.760]  most of those who suffer from the outbreak,
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:17.760]  whether it's mumps or flu or something else,
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:20.760]  have already been vaccinated against that very thing.
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:21.760]  They never report that.
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:26.760]  Yes, the reporting in the media of the vaccine issue is so unsidered,
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:31.760]  so distorted, so pro-the CDC,
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:35.760]  pro-the pharmaceutical industry, pro-more and more vaccines.
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:38.760]  We're not going to get the truth from the mainstream media, I'm afraid,
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:40.760]  and that's going to last for some time.
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:43.760]  Yeah, we're not going to get the truth from them on any front.
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:46.760]  Let's go to another caller, Nick, in Pennsylvania.
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:47.760]  Nick, welcome to the show.
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:48.760]  You're on the air.
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:49.760]  Go ahead, sir.
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:53.760]  Mike, first of all, I want to say I think that you're doing a great job
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:58.760]  filling in for Alex, and you're doing a heck of a good job.
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:00.760]  I'm just doing my best here, man.
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:02.760]  We're all fighting for the same liberties.
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:04.760]  That's all there is to it.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:05.760]  Absolutely.
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:09.760]  And Dr. Wakefield, I just want to say it's really a pleasure, sir,
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:11.760]  to be talking to you.
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:18.760]  I myself actually am one of America's few remaining pioneer research scientists,
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:21.760]  and it's such a good coincidence that you happened to be on,
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:25.760]  because there is a couple of objects that I'd like to talk to you about
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:27.760]  of a very important concern.
[2:49:27.760 --> 2:49:28.760]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:29.760]  Let's hear it.
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:36.760]  Okay, one of the subjects is I definitely agree with the vaccine problem,
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:40.760]  especially being given to children, infants, babies.
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:43.760]  There's definitely a problem with mercury and heavy metals,
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:49.760]  and I think that they're absolutely positively is a link to autism
[2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:51.760]  because of that mercury.
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:55.760]  That's why, as far as tuna fish is concerned,
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:49:57.760]  that has finally been brought to life.
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:00.760]  You have to be careful with certain fish you eat
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:05.760]  because of the mercury levels that are high in certain types of fish,
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:07.760]  to be one of them.
[2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:12.760]  But another problem is also the fact that,
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:15.760]  and it figures that there happens to be a phone ringing in the background
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:17.760]  as my call comes in.
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:19.760]  No, go ahead, we're getting close to break.
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:20.760]  Go ahead with your question.
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  I apologize.
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:22.760]  That's all right.
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:25.760]  But the other thing that I wanted to bring up,
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:28.760]  you know what, let me unplug this other phone.
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:30.760]  Well, let me just ask Dr. Wakefield to comment on that.
[2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:34.760]  So the FDA at one point did say you shouldn't eat too much tuna fish
[2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:36.760]  because of mercury, but they even backed off of that.
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:39.760]  So it's suddenly like mercury is the favorite element
[2:50:39.760 --> 2:50:42.760]  of the scientific medical corrupt community.
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:43.760]  What's up with that?
[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:46.760]  I'm told by the experts that mercury is second only to plutonium
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:48.760]  on this planet as a toxin.
[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:52.760]  So it's not safe in any form or in any dose.
[2:50:52.760 --> 2:50:55.760]  There are no safe levels and no safe forms.
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:57.760]  The idea that one's better than the other.
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:17.760]  We'll be right back.
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:52.760]  For the craziest offer we've ever made,

[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:45.760]  ground transportation included and more,
[2:52:45.760 --> 2:52:48.760]  all more affordable than you can imagine.

[2:52:59.760 --> 2:53:02.760]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation,
[2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:05.760]  weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:07.760]  The progressive deterioration of the body
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:10.760]  that occurs almost universally the older one gets
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:12.760]  can partly to significantly be prevented
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:15.760]  with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[2:53:15.760 --> 2:53:18.760]  If the Hunzelmen can play rugby in their 90s,
[2:53:18.760 --> 2:53:20.760]  then it is possible for everyone in North America
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:22.760]  to experience a more youthful life as well.
[2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:25.760]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:28.760]  is the type and quality of protein consumed.
[2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:30.760]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume
[2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:34.760]  are heat damaged, destroying 50 to 75% of your ability
[2:53:34.760 --> 2:53:37.760]  to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids.
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:39.760]  One world way is not heat damaged
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:43.760]  and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:46.760]  In just a few weeks, no one else has achieved.
[2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:49.760]  The results to your help can be amazing.

[2:53:56.760 --> 2:54:14.760]  And we're back on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:54:14.760 --> 2:54:17.760]  Thank you again for joining us on our final segment today.
[2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:20.760]  And by the way, don't miss The Alex Jones Show Sunday,
[2:54:20.760 --> 2:54:23.760]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Time and also Monday.
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:27.760]  On Obamacare and some hidden payoffs to Big Pharma
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:30.760]  that we have located in the Obamacare
[2:54:30.760 --> 2:54:32.760]  so-called Affordable Healthcare Act,
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:35.760]  which has made healthcare unaffordable for almost everyone.
[2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:37.760]  But Dr. Wakefield continues with us in the studio here
[2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:40.760]  for this last segment, so let's get right to the question
[2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:44.760]  of psychiatric drugs and their links to violent shooters
[2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:46.760]  time and time again.
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:50.760]  Dr. Wakefield, although I know perhaps psychiatry
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:53.760]  is not your specialty, but you are well-trained MD,
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:55.760]  your skeptical thinking scientist,
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:58.760]  what are your thoughts on psychiatric drugs and violent shootings?
[2:54:58.760 --> 2:55:02.760]  It's interesting because it brings in the subject of autism again.
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:05.760]  Back in 1996, I was first introduced to this.
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:08.760]  I don't remember the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania,
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:11.760]  a guy in the early morning shot over 40 people,
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:13.760]  45 people dead in a cafe,
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:16.760]  and it was said at the time that he had Asperger syndrome,
[2:55:16.760 --> 2:55:18.760]  high-functioning autism.
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:20.760]  In fact, he didn't at all, and when you go back
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:23.760]  and read the psychiatric records from the prison psychiatrist
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:25.760]  who assessed him there, he had symptoms
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:27.760]  which specifically precluded Asperger.
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:30.760]  In other words, the common denominator was not that they had
[2:55:30.760 --> 2:55:33.760]  a psychiatric or an autistic spectrum disorder,
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:36.760]  so I went back and I reviewed so many of these cases
[2:55:36.760 --> 2:55:38.760]  that have occurred of multiple killings,
[2:55:38.760 --> 2:55:42.760]  actions of mass violence in schools or some shopping mall,
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:44.760]  and looking for a common denominator.
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:46.760]  It comes down to this, Mike, looking for patterns.
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:48.760]  What is the pattern? Is it an autistic spectrum disorder?
[2:55:48.760 --> 2:55:51.760]  No. Is it a personality disorder? No.
[2:55:51.760 --> 2:55:53.760]  What was the common denominator was that
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:55:56.760]  they were all taking psychotropic medications,
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:55:58.760]  and in many cases psychotropic medications
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:01.760]  that were not licensed, not indicated
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.760]  for the particular problem that they had.
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:05.760]  There is no sight or there certainly was at that time
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:07.760]  no psychotropic medication that could be used
[2:56:07.760 --> 2:56:10.760]  for treating Aspergers, and what we now find
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:12.760]  is that in the last few years,
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:15.760]  Janssen Pharmaceuticals, subsidiary of J&J,
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:17.760]  Abbott Laboratories, and GlaxoSmithKline
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:19.760]  have been pushing these drugs off-label
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:21.760]  to vulnerable children in many cases.
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:23.760]  And they've been sued by some states
[2:56:23.760 --> 2:56:25.760]  for the off-label marketing of their drugs as well.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:27.760]  Absolutely, and I have seen this at first hand.
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:29.760]  I've seen violence in children with autism at first hand,
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:31.760]  not because they're autistic, but I believe
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:34.760]  because they're being pushed these drugs off-license
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:38.760]  for inducements like going to a golf day or going to the spa.
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:40.760]  It's absolutely farcical and disgraceful
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:44.760]  that doctors have put children at risk,
[2:56:44.760 --> 2:56:46.760]  giving them these powerful drugs
[2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:49.760]  that were never indicated for the problems that they have.
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:52.760]  And I believe that a large part of the risk factor
[2:56:52.760 --> 2:56:55.760]  for these outbreaks of mass violence is the drugs that they're on.
[2:56:55.760 --> 2:56:57.760]  Well said, and just to clarify when I say
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:56:59.760]  they've been sued by the states,
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:01.760]  I don't know if those you mentioned have been sued,
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:03.760]  but I know by and large, big pharmaceutical companies
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  have been sued, time and time, those three have.
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  OK, that's good to confirm.
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:10.760]  One of the things we know about these drugs
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:13.760]  is they tend to create a sense of cognitive detachment
[2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:14.760]  in their ability.
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:16.760]  So for example, the Columbine shooters said
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:18.760]  that they believe they were playing out
[2:57:18.760 --> 2:57:20.760]  a first-person shooter video game.
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:22.760]  So some people might start to blame the video games,
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:25.760]  but I think more is the mindset,
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:30.760]  the detachment in the mind that's caused by the psychiatric drugs.
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:33.760]  So is this detachment something that you've also seen
[2:57:33.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  as a pattern in other violent outbursts?
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:37.760]  Well, it's difficult to tell exactly
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:40.760]  what's going on in the mind of people
[2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:42.760]  when they're having, for example, violent ideation.
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:44.760]  Are they playing a game? Do they suddenly feel
[2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:47.760]  the world is against them with the SSRIs,
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:49.760]  the second-generation antidepressants?
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:52.760]  It's often violence in those people who have no history whatsoever
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:55.760]  of violent behavior. They suddenly have these violent outbursts.
[2:57:55.760 --> 2:57:57.760]  And I've seen it in some of our patients,
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:57:59.760]  and it stops when we stop the drugs.
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:02.760]  And isn't it interesting that Obama's 23 executive orders,
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:05.760]  not one of them, looked at the link
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:08.760]  between psychiatric drugs and violent shootings?
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:10.760]  So he may be ignoring the actual cause of all this.
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:12.760]  He may be, I don't know, you don't know,
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:14.760]  but we do know that that's a common denominator.
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:18.760]  And to miss it out in trying to find the culprit for these outbreaks
[2:58:18.760 --> 2:58:20.760]  means that there are going to be more and more of these attacks
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:22.760]  because they're not getting to the heart,
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:24.760]  the core problem that is causing them the first blow.
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:26.760]  Well, they want more attacks, Dr. Wakefield.
[2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:28.760]  They want more attacks because it'll let them ban
[2:58:28.760 --> 2:58:31.760]  more firearms, knives, hammers, you name it.
[2:58:31.760 --> 2:58:33.760]  Thank you for being on the show, Dr. Wakefield.
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:35.760]  The retransmission begins now,
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:37.760]  and thank you for joining us today here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:58:37.760 --> 2:58:40.760]  This is Mike Adams. Take care.
