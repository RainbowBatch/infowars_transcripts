[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Do you want to kill Nazis?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  I don't want to kill anyone.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  I don't like bullies.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  I don't care where they're from.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  I believe Captain America was a composite character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation.
[00:22.000 --> 00:31.000]  There's another analogy to be taken from Captain America, and that is that that generation, and America in general, has essentially fallen asleep like Captain America did.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  As you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's living in an authoritarian police state.
[00:38.000 --> 00:46.000]  For a second day in a row, a group of World War II vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  Mary needs his barricades back!
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  Wow!
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  I go protect Iraqis in Iraq, and I come back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by police.
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  Why are you sanitizing the principal? I'm well aware of the danger. I've spent eight years in combat.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  For once, we're way ahead of the curve.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection.
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  Police in National Guard going street by street, house to house, and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  We're going to neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  The punishment usually came after the crime.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  And when they say, I want my lawyer, you tell them, shut up!
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  Your time isn't to get a lawyer. You're an enemy combat.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  You guys did some nasty stuff.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  Yeah. We compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  Well, when I was in Afghanistan, they usually kept us outside these buildings.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  And the other government agency guys, probably like DEA, CIA and all of that,
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  they would go into these kind of rooms like that, exactly.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  And they would be torturing people from in there.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  Horrible scream to hear a grown person like that being tortured.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  You're watching as this opium is being grown.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  With all due respect, if SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  You have a lot of people that are coming out of the military
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  This is only going to get worse once it starts.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  And again, there's no veterans doing anything right now.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  No IEDs. They are literally getting the police to pick a fight with veterans.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  You are standing in my brain.
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  How did you get here?
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  Invited.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  Operation paperclip after World War II, SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic values.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  Assault I could help their cause.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  Operation paperclip explores the secret military program that hired scientists
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  who use slave labor to build the V2 rocket
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.000]  and others who use concentration camp victims for human experiments.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  The responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  is uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis,
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  but excluded from the official history is the fact that Hitler and the National Socialists
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  would not have risen to power without the help of international bankers
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  and American and German corporations.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the internet.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  Including hydras.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  And SHIELDs.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  What about Bradley Manning?
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  What about Bradley Manning?
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  I think the revelations are terrible because they were revealed.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  What's his name?
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  Snowden.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  Yes, Snowden.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  I think he's a traitor.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  What about the others?
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  Are you planning a rescue mission?
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  You think about what is going on with the Veterans Administration Hospital
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  and the fact that we have veterans that are dying because they're on a wait list.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  You talk about Sergeant Tamarisi and his situation.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  We told you to not get him.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Pursue him!
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  Something that I've been upset about and raised in pain
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  about, and so I'm going to ask you about it.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  And that's this right wing extremism report that was mailed out to all law enforcement
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  officials from the United States.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  I apologize for that report.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  It was not authorized to be distributed.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  This is a freedom.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  This is fear.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  It's getting damn near past time that you can get to put that program in the capital.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  Go on to breath.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  Rallaging Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  And of course that film came out a year and a half ago
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  and was absolutely pro-liberty, pro-freedom, pro-America, pro-human.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  Now Sony bought it and then it got passed on over to Disney
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  and they are putting out 110% propaganda demonizing gun owners, veterans you name it
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  and Captain America now works for Hydra.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  I mean what will it take to finally wake you up?
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  Think about it.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  It's politics incorporated and your choice between the two parties is a myth
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  because in reality it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology, divide and conquer.
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  Concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.000]  you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  and enhance overall health.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  This winter season it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil oregano.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  I am Marc Hennie.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  I will overview this line line line.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  that children would actually like and take.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  and essential nutrients that taste great.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  Obtain your Child Ease today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[08:04.000 --> 08:30.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:30.000 --> 08:37.000]  There are moments in television, moments in media
[08:37.000 --> 08:44.000]  where the full import of how big something is
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  isn't understood for weeks, months, even years.
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  But what we witnessed last night with the CNBC Republican debate
[08:56.000 --> 09:05.000]  moderated by CNBC is evident pretty much instantly.
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  This is a Polaroid moment where you don't have to wait more than just a few seconds
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  after the debate.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  I was sitting there watching it with family and children
[09:17.000 --> 09:25.000]  and even let my children stay up late to finish it and see the aftermath.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  And I asked my children, my 13-year-old son,
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  my 11-year-old daughter, my 7-year-old daughter,
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  while we were watching the coverage that InfoWars was engaged in
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  with David Nijikari Jackson and, of course, Joe Biggs and others.
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  And my children said the reporters, that's what they call them, were reporters
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  that really just pundits, were trying to bully and trying to attack
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  and trying to make the Republican candidates look stupid,
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  but they looked stupid.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  That's what Rex Jones, my 13-year-old, had to say about it.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  And that's exactly what the nation had to say about it.
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  That's exactly what even mainstream media had to say about it.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  You see, what mainstream media doesn't get is that even more hated
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  than establishment Democrat and Republican candidates,
[10:26.000 --> 10:35.000]  dinosaur media is even more disdained, more reviled, more hated.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  I'll never forget, I've told the story many times,
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  when Rand Paul got elected four and a half years ago to the Senate,
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  Politico called me and they'd made a big deal about Rand Paul coming on this show
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  and Rand Paul being a listener and Rand Paul coming on 20 years ago
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  and being a friend of the show.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  And I said, don't you get it?
[10:58.000 --> 11:07.000]  The only way you could have hurt Rand Paul was for you to endorse him.
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  You're out of bullets.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  The mainstream media is running on empty.
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  And of course, they quoted me a bunch in the article, but they didn't quote that part.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  And you notice Rand Paul isn't as successful in poll numbers as he was just four months ago
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  as the front-runner, now he's in the middle of the pack,
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  because he's been more accepted by the establishment,
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  because he's moderated his stance,
[11:37.000 --> 11:45.000]  and he's destroying himself thinking that people like Donald Trump
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  are going to recede in this campaign.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  That is nothing but media spin.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  And I tell Senator Paul this in a friendly way,
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  but I don't want to digress at this point.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  Getting back to the big issue at hand, coming up at the bottom of the hour,
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  I want to cover world news, economic news first, police state news, attacks on the First Amendment,
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  huge developments, obviously, with Paul Ryan being elected speaker.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  That's all coming up.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  But if you look at DrudgeReport.com, all-out war against CNBC,
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  Bush campaign manager, confronts producer,
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  Grove, lame streamers, total debate failed.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  Bozell Forum was an example of bias,
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  an encyclopedic example of bias.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  Hannity will go down in history as really bad night for the media.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  I agree with that statement.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  Moderators booed again and again.
[12:50.000 --> 12:57.000]  They both boast about limiting debate time so we can get the hell out of here.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  Meanwhile, we learn RNC chairman threw candidates to the wolves.
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  There's a revolt en masse.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  That's right.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  You have the Rhino-Neocon Republicans always trying to hamstring
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  a libertarian constitutional takeover of the Republican Party.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  There's a landslide already happening at the state level across the nation.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  And Paul Ryan being elected is part of that.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  The CISA bill, the surveillance bill has been passed,
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  masquerading as a cyber security bill.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  They are ramming a lot through while we're busy eating popcorn watching the debate.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  The good news is you've got the Republican leadership working against the candidates
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  that they don't control and that are popular.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  You've got the mainstream media trying to sabotage them.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  You've got all these dirty tricks being run against Carson and others.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  And all it does is empower them.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  When they attack Trump, he goes up in the numbers.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  When they attack Carson, he goes up in the numbers.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  When they attack Huckabee, he starts getting traction.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  You do not get traction out of eating out of the hand of these people.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  These people obviously do not have good intentions for us.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  And I know our audience knows this, but when Hannity says,
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  this will go down in history as a really bad night for the media, it's beyond that.
[14:29.000 --> 14:39.000]  This will go down in history as another major signpost that the dinosaur media is dying big time.
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  And the more anger, the more disdain, the more vitriol, the more bravada,
[14:45.000 --> 15:01.000]  the more sickening hutzpah and hubris that we saw spewed by the three nasty, nasty, nasty moderators
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  only illustrated their disconnect and their arrogance.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  They wanted to demonize the Republican Party.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  They wanted to demonize the candidates that weren't establishment.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  They would give softball questions to the Republicans that they know are part of the team
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  while viciously attacking people they don't control.
[15:22.000 --> 15:31.000]  It was crystal clear that this was a rigged attempt to derail Patriot candidates
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  and instead it was a fiasco, it was a disaster, it was a train wreck,
[15:37.000 --> 15:45.000]  it was an implosion for the sycophantic media whores.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  This weekend I was hiking in the mountains of south of Texas
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  and it really hit me that we've had so many debates, so many calls, so many guests talk about
[15:55.000 --> 16:07.000]  what should we call the Decepticon mainstream, sewage stream, collaborator, prostitute, corporate media.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  And it hit me. Straight talk is the answer.
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.000]  Straight labels that actually fit what something is, is what we should go with.
[16:18.000 --> 16:25.000]  You don't call butter concentrated milk fat, you call it butter.
[16:25.000 --> 16:35.000]  You don't call chocolate recondensed sugared cocoa powder, you call it chocolate.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  You don't call a pile of horse manure on the side of the road,
[16:38.000 --> 16:50.000]  some scientific name for the leavings of the equine species.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  You call it what it is.
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  They are the enemy.
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  Mainstream media is the enemy.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  They are the deceivers.
[17:02.000 --> 17:14.000]  They are the enemy propaganda arms of the major corporations that brag they've conquered this country.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  They are collaborators.
[17:16.000 --> 17:25.000]  They are here to deny there's a TPP, deny there's a CFR, deny there's a New World Order until it's too late.
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  Deny there's a Gen 21, deny there's a move to get our guns, deny Obamacare, double shrivels prices,
[17:31.000 --> 17:39.000]  has death panels, restricts care, deny that there's penalties, but all of it's now happening.
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  You see, they're just the front minions that are disposable.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  That's why they'll get up there and tell lies that will destroy their careers very soon
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  and have already destroyed them in many cases because they're paid as mercenaries not to be popular,
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  but to deceive the public.
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.000]  And then they put in new deceivers. Notice how they go through reporters faster and faster.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  It used to be every decade they'd go through anchors.
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  Then it was every couple years, now it's every couple months there's new people
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.000]  because they're trying to confuse folks with new faces.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  Oh, your brain associates the last crop from six months ago with lying to you.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  Here's a new crop. Here's more shark teeth rolling forward.
[18:20.000 --> 18:28.000]  And boy, they're really starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  So just like I pointed out five years ago that the climate gain emails would devastate the global carbon tax movement
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  and devastate the center of the world government program.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  I use the Star Wars analogy of it was a death star destruction event, episode four level event.
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  I mean, the Empire was defeated, but man, it was a crushing defeat.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  Obama not getting his gun control through.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  Devastating defeat.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  Our military saying they wouldn't find on the side of Al Qaeda three years ago in Syria.
[19:03.000 --> 19:12.000]  Devastating, devastating, devastating defeat.
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  And we're having more and more of those victories every month now.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  It's not a huge victory every year.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  It's now every month, every week, we are savaging them in this knife fight.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  Now, early on in the fight, they stabbed us. They cut us up really bad.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  I'm not saying we're even winning, but the last few rounds of this knife fight,
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  we are plunging double edge daggers into their organs.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  They are bleeding out in front of us, but now they're really dangerous.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  They're the bloods running out of them, they're turning death white.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  They're going to fall over really quick or start a giant war to overturn the tables.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  But either way, we've got them.
[19:51.000 --> 20:03.000]  So just focus, pray to God, attack in the info war and just keep stabbing and slashing and cutting.
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages or war.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  We typically do the same thing.
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  But have you considered heat storage?
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  How will I keep my family warm?
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  The standard answers are firewood, coal or propane.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move is, you can't take it with you.
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  Another concern, there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke,
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  like in times of war.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[20:52.000 --> 21:06.000]  FortressClothing.com, you'll never be cold again.
[21:22.000 --> 21:32.000]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  I loved my dad.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  But boy was he stubborn.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  His excuse?
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  Don't wait.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis,
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  but they're about to lose control.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined,
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  Before that, I warned that.com companies would crash, and they did.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves,
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  This will affect us all.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions,
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  but first, you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today,
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  but there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented one-silver solution.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  Boost your immune system at a great price with our Silver Solution Liquid,
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  starting at $12.95 a bottle, now available in regular and extra strength.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  That's half the price of the leading competitors.
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  Call 844-U-SILVER for your free catalog, or go to onesilversolution.com.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  OneSilversolution.com.
[23:26.000 --> 23:53.000]  There is only one Silver Solution.
[23:56.000 --> 24:10.000]  Every move you make, every breath you take, it will be given to select loveless corporations illegally.
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  Private companies and government will put up fake cell towers everywhere
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  and steal your data live time, committing felonies every time they do it,
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.000]  thousands of times a minute, per machine, and no one will get in trouble.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  But then the government will lecture us all day about law and order
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  and how they need to take our teenagers to jail if they catch them at a beer party,
[24:36.000 --> 24:43.000]  or how the IRS outside of judges or juries should be able to take our bank accounts because they said so,
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  even though they have a long history of criminal activity.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  This government at the top is illegitimate.
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  It's seeking to now federalize all local governments
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  and is using a push to supposedly clean up local governments as the pretext.
[25:02.000 --> 25:09.000]  Senate passes CISA, the Surveillance Bill, masquerading as a cybersecurity bill.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  Paul Ryan has been elected to the House Speaker.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  Some will say, well, where's our victory?
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  We got rid of Boehner and now we have Ryan.
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.000]  Well, Ryan will be more short-lived as Speaker if he doesn't try to actually repair the country.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  It doesn't matter. He's pushed for open borders.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  It doesn't matter that he's been an anti-gunner.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  It doesn't matter if he gets an F when it comes to conservatism.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  People are now aware of him.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  The climate has changed.
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.000]  Folks know the Democratic and Republican leadership are working together to suppress the Liberty Movement.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  And so the demonization of Hollywood and CNBC moderators and all the rest of it
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  only causes the public to support patriot candidates that much more.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  So don't run from their demonization. Embrace it.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  And as the hoax that they're the moral authority and that they're truthful dissipates.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  It's the beginning of the end for these people.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  Continuing after the break, we're going to get into some of the clips from the debate and the highlights.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  But now I wanted to break down some of the other news.
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  Look at this news in political correctness areas.
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  University tells students making kissing sounds is sexual harassment.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  The police will be called.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  That's at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  We have the official student handouts where they break it all down.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  Sleeping comfortably while white, now racist scientists claim.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  Remember Melissa Harris Perry.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  And if you're a new listener, I'm not kidding. Just search engine this term. You can pull it up.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  Says working hard. That term is meant to demean black slaves.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  All language is hateful.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  And unless it's approved by the cult leaders.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  California considers adding meat to cancer alert list.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  The state is setting a stage for potential battle with meat industry.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Remember they said all fats were bad too.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  Now they admit that's not the case.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  This is just a way to tax meat.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  There's a report out today where the EPA is smashing pumpkins in a new video advertisement.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  Saying plants are bad because they increase the carbon footprint.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  That's right. Plants don't just release oxygen.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  They release carbon dioxide as part of the carbon cycle.
[27:39.000 --> 27:48.000]  That's why we have life on the planet is the animal plant symbiotic cycle with water and the sun combined.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  Now they're smashing pumpkins.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  We're not talking about Billy Corrigan. This is not a pun.
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  They are now smashing pumpkins.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  And they're coming out and saying that sunlight is bad for the earth.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  I'm not joking.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  If you're a new listener, this is not satire.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  This is not Saturday Night Live.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  Kissing sounds illegal.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  Having a Halloween party.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  Racist.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  Sleeping comfortably.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  Racist.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  Now setting up Planned Parenthoods in every black neighborhood.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  And the charter saying it's to kill black people because they're subhuman.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  That's okay.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  But they're going to have to divert us off and everything that doesn't matter to create total infighting and just total mental illness and total.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  Oh my gosh.
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  A Japanese woman that doesn't speak English.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  Black people walk over to her and say, do you think we're inwards?
[28:48.000 --> 28:54.000]  Knowing full well a Japanese woman that doesn't speak English only knows about hip hop and goes, yes, yes, yes.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  You want to party?
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  What are you doing, racist?
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  Huh?
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Get out of here before we beat you up.
[29:01.000 --> 29:08.000]  I mean, this is the craziness that we've reached.
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  Where the great priests, the high priest of political control, they get to label whatever they want as evil.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  They get to label it as bad.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  They get to demonize it.
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.000]  But then all the real threats, they get ignored.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  Then coming up, mentally unstable, Barack Obama wants to start war with China.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  Runaway blimp that the government isn't telling you about.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  I got a call from the Daily Beast last night.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  What do I think about the blimp?
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  And I didn't know about the blimp.
[29:34.000 --> 29:42.000]  So I went to Info Wars and sure enough, there was a report up there by Joe Biggs that one of these giant surveillance blimps that we talked about 15 years ago crashed.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  And so now the media wants to know what I have to say about that.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  Because another thing we told you about comes true because it was already there.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  It didn't come true.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  It was already there.
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[29:53.000 --> 30:19.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  We feel like we're under siege and we don't much feel like getting out of our cars, he said.
[30:24.000 --> 30:32.000]  Police have responded to widespread video recording of their activity by arresting people for obstruction, resisting arrest and other charges.
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  Several high profile cases of police brutality have been exposed by cell phones.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  Civil Liberty experts argue citizens have the right to record police in public under the First Amendment.
[30:43.000 --> 30:53.000]  Some states are even using wiretapping laws implemented before the advent of cell phone technology to prosecute citizens who record police in post videos on the internet.
