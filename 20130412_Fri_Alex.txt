[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:21.120]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.120 --> 00:36.200]  Man, I tell you, this North Korea situation is off the charts. And I thought back to Lindsey
[00:36.200 --> 00:43.480]  Williams, who two years ago on the show, well, really three years ago, he from his source,
[00:43.480 --> 00:48.320]  I know who his source is, has been a Bilderberg attendee before, former head of one of the big
[00:48.320 --> 00:52.760]  three oil companies. You can say what you want about Lindsey Williams, I think he's
[00:52.760 --> 00:59.360]  a good guy, a little repetitive sometimes, but aren't we all?
[00:59.360 --> 01:03.700]  But I know who his sources are, one of them's dead now, and it's just an interesting window
[01:03.700 --> 01:08.040]  into things. Because this was before they even shifted one of the big fleets to the
[01:08.040 --> 01:14.260]  Pacific. He was saying three years ago, wish I had the staff to dig all this up, but you
[01:14.260 --> 01:23.600]  heard him, that Alex, do not worry about the destabilization in the Middle East, bad imitation.
[01:23.600 --> 01:31.420]  But when they move into Asia and North Korea, that is the big one, he said. And maybe it's
[01:31.420 --> 01:37.160]  not gonna happen now, but I'm telling you, it is wild what's going on.
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.320]  Then about a year after he started saying that, they shifted the main fleets over to
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.000]  the Pacific. And now it turns out the West has secretly met the United States back in
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.920]  March, with the North Korean leadership. Dr. Steve Pechenik, who I think is back in the
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.520]  US today, we need to get him to pop in to talk about this.
[01:55.520 --> 02:03.200]  But Paul Watson has the article up at infowars.com today, who gave North Korea nukes in the first
[02:03.200 --> 02:12.800]  place. And it gets into ABB and Donald Rumsfeld, obviously, being the ones that did that, the
[02:12.800 --> 02:18.920]  US government and the CIA. But again, the US government has been taken over by the New
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.920]  World Order.
[02:19.920 --> 02:24.720]  So the New World Order, it's not like the US government's coming after our guns, the
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.520]  captured collaborator US government, which isn't the US government anymore. I mean, I
[02:29.520 --> 02:35.200]  keep trying to explain this, just cuz a hijacker conks the pilot on the head and puts on his
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.760]  uniform and walks out and says, I am now the pilot, I am taking you to Iran.
[02:39.760 --> 02:46.120]  I mean, everybody knows that's not really the pilot. But when you have one of these
[02:46.120 --> 02:53.560]  soft coups, foreign corporate espionage, infiltrations, corporate takeover, I mean, that's really
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.160]  what the New World Order is. It's a corporate takeover of the planet, of anti-free market
[02:59.160 --> 03:05.160]  monopoly combines, who happened to have a belief system in eugenics and who want to
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.160]  live forever.
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.360]  Duh, who wouldn't, especially when you're worth billions of dollars, control trillions,
[03:11.360 --> 03:17.080]  you've got everything. What are they obsessed with? Living longer and they don't like seeing
[03:17.080 --> 03:22.040]  crowds of people. They just stain the dumbed down public who they've helped dumb down.
[03:22.040 --> 03:29.080]  And I mean, always the public is simple minded on average compared to good, very smart people
[03:29.080 --> 03:37.840]  and bad smart people. I mean, good smart people wanna build up the dumb people, wanna help
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.320]  their brethren, bad smart people want to kill you.
[03:41.320 --> 03:47.320]  And let me explain something to the public, you're begging for it. You're begging for
[03:47.320 --> 03:55.560]  it. You're begging for it. You are begging for it. I go down to Barton Springs sometimes
[03:55.560 --> 03:59.960]  and swim and the last month they haven't changed the big clock for swimmers. The time's wrong
[03:59.960 --> 04:05.980]  and the hour's wrong and I keep telling them and they can't understand me what that means.
[04:05.980 --> 04:10.800]  And I'm seeing signs of this everywhere. I call it mass zombieosis or people going into
[04:10.800 --> 04:15.040]  a trance and it's intensifying. And let me tell you something, nothing against Californians
[04:15.040 --> 04:18.120]  because some of the most awake people I know are in California because they're around a
[04:18.120 --> 04:19.120]  bunch of zombies.
[04:19.120 --> 04:24.480]  But I see videos and I've been out in California and you talk to the general public, they don't
[04:24.480 --> 04:29.480]  even hardly know how to talk. And I predict, in fact, this is already happening, the language
[04:29.480 --> 04:33.680]  has shrunk. In fact, Chris, print me something about language shrinking, amount of words
[04:33.680 --> 04:38.280]  being used shrinking. There's a bunch of articles on that, that people will even stop talking
[04:38.280 --> 04:44.000]  soon and then they'll stop going out and then they'll stop eating and then they're gonna
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  die.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.680]  It's like it's already happening in South Korea, the most connected country in the world.
[04:49.680 --> 04:53.800]  People just watch TV or play video games. Every week you see it in the news till they
[04:53.800 --> 05:00.960]  die. And this is the big secret. We're going to talk about it today.
[05:00.960 --> 05:06.240]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[05:06.240 --> 05:11.060]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping

[06:00.860 --> 06:06.440]  years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods
[06:06.440 --> 06:11.800]  raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest
[06:11.800 --> 06:16.360]  drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind. And
[06:16.360 --> 06:21.280]  so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages
[06:21.280 --> 06:25.560]  drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature, but you
[06:25.560 --> 06:30.560]  can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[08:15.880 --> 08:22.960]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[08:22.960 --> 08:52.880]  he. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Monday through Friday, from 11am until 8pm,
[08:52.880 --> 09:00.800]  Central Standard Time, we are here live and we're not turning away. We're not watching
[09:00.800 --> 09:07.080]  humanity go down the tubes, collapse under mind control into mass zombie state without
[09:07.080 --> 09:12.340]  a fight, ladies and gentlemen. I stand for truth, justice and liberty worldwide. I stand
[09:12.340 --> 09:20.920]  for the spirit of 1776 worldwide that trumps 1984 all day and all night. But you must first
[09:20.920 --> 09:26.760]  become animated with the animating contest of liberty. You know what I love in life?
[09:26.760 --> 09:33.720]  I love real people. I love people that aren't fake and I love people that are animated with
[09:33.720 --> 09:40.340]  the spirit of liberty. And you talk to somebody who's animated, who has energy, who is bubbly.
[09:40.340 --> 09:44.800]  You just want to be around them. They're amazing. And then you get around the general public
[09:44.800 --> 09:52.480]  more and more act like lethargic sloths that have had electrochemical lobotomies.
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.520]  And I mean, it's getting worse and worse and worse. And every generation talks about young
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.640]  people. And we've got one of the most awake, focused, dynamic, amazing groups of young
[10:02.640 --> 10:10.200]  people that I've ever seen in my life. Seeing my generation and looking at older generations
[10:10.200 --> 10:14.800]  and experiencing several younger generations before me. We have some of the most awake,
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.360]  dynamic young people ever, but that's a minority.
[10:18.360 --> 10:24.120]  The majority of them love being sloths, love being pathetic, wear their ignorance like
[10:24.120 --> 10:31.300]  a sheet of armor, and basically don't even know how to wipe their noses. And the New
[10:31.300 --> 10:36.760]  World Order is not gonna just let you sit around and draw welfare and lay around all
[10:36.760 --> 10:41.600]  day, okay? They're gonna get you on the government dole for a while, they're gonna give you government
[10:41.600 --> 10:44.240]  jobs to run our lives.
[10:44.240 --> 10:47.040]  And then once they've got everything fully collectivized, they're gonna shut everything
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.080]  off incrementally. And they're gonna start giant wars and they're gonna release bio weapons
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.320]  and say they're natural plagues. And the vaccines they give you are gonna further brain damage
[10:57.320 --> 11:05.620]  you and engage in real electrochemical lobotomies with the nanotech anti-stress vaccines they're
[11:05.620 --> 11:06.760]  coming out with.
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.560]  That's what they're called, which some evidence, it's not just television and flicker rate
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.540]  putting people into a trance state. I've talked to a lot of people I know that have taken
[11:14.540 --> 11:21.840]  the, especially the H1N1, and they're different people. They're not just had their IQs lowered,
[11:21.840 --> 11:28.080]  they aren't real anymore. And I've recognized this enemy operation for at least a decade
[11:28.080 --> 11:33.480]  reading different MIT papers and things, but it's already happened.
[11:33.480 --> 11:39.120]  And Bill Gates is coming out with food, clothing, chemtrail sprays, he's funding geoengineering
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.440]  that has vaccines in it. It's on their website, they're putting hundreds of millions into
[11:43.440 --> 11:49.200]  that. How to manipulate your gut flora without you knowing, I mean, they're very public about
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.580]  programming us and it's an incredible war crime against humanity.
[11:53.580 --> 12:00.960]  But their propaganda is in ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, the cover of Costco
[12:00.960 --> 12:07.240]  Magazine, just Time Magazine, Newsweek, just everywhere I look. Bill Gates loves you, he's
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.760]  an angel. So people say, what do you mean he's an angel? I mean, thank God for Bill
[12:12.760 --> 12:13.760]  Gates.
[12:13.760 --> 12:21.640]  Okay, go take his shots then. I mean, never mind that they had 60 something thousand kids
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.440]  get paralyzed off his shots in India last year alone. And it's a minor footnote. We're
[12:27.440 --> 12:32.400]  not calling it polio though, we call it a type of paralysis. Truth is they didn't get
[12:32.400 --> 12:37.320]  rid of polio, neurological disorders and paralysis is at record highs.
[12:37.320 --> 12:43.040]  They just don't hype it up. You see, there's the difference, you can have 200, 300,000
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.280]  deaths from infections, it varies every year in hospitals. You can have 200 and something
[12:47.280 --> 12:53.760]  thousand from drug overdoses in hospitals. You can have a couple hundred thousand from
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.720]  doctor error every year. I mean, it's well over 800,000 people a year dying one way or
[12:59.720 --> 13:09.200]  another from medical neglect or abuse or different variants of that malpractice.
[13:09.200 --> 13:15.800]  And just going into these hospitals and facilities that just have the most powerful drug resistant,
[13:15.800 --> 13:23.160]  radiation resistant, chemical resistant bugs you can imagine. I mean, insects that have
[13:23.160 --> 13:29.160]  been pesticide within three or four generations almost always become somewhat immune or resistant
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.760]  or completely resistant to poisons, or you can put poison right on them and they don't
[13:34.760 --> 13:35.760]  die.
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.320]  What do you think happens with bacteria and viruses? By the way, though, in that is the
[13:41.320 --> 13:49.080]  key to our salvation, because I wanna explain something. Humans are the most dynamic, powerful,
[13:49.080 --> 13:55.760]  intelligent, incredible, enlightened, beautiful, transcendent creatures this planet has. That's
[13:55.760 --> 13:58.720]  why they tell you you're ugly, you're bad, you're no good all day, so you don't figure
[13:58.720 --> 13:59.720]  that out.
[13:59.720 --> 14:05.320]  So that you just imagine you're this ball of scum who embraces your weakness because
[14:05.320 --> 14:12.880]  you were told you were weak. You see, that's even your own adaptation manipulating you.
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.740]  The New World Order is not going to be able to shut all of us down. Their viral cocktails
[14:17.740 --> 14:22.920]  aren't gonna work on all of us. And believe me, the subconscious drives the conscious
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.420]  and the brain is connected through the spinal cord to the rest of your body.
[14:27.420 --> 14:32.480]  And the mere fact that I'm talking about how you're under attack right now, even if you're
[14:32.480 --> 14:41.280]  a jellyfish consciously, I am commanding jellyfish right now, spineless people. I am commanding
[14:41.280 --> 14:47.160]  you. I am commanding you through your instincts, through your ancestors, through your common
[14:47.160 --> 14:53.400]  sense. And of course, God is commanding you through your spirit to activate right now
[14:53.400 --> 14:55.120]  and launch defenses.
[14:55.120 --> 15:01.360]  And believe me, the defenses are launched. So the globalists have got a big problem on
[15:01.360 --> 15:11.240]  their hands, okay? Because there is autopilot, ladies and gentlemen, they know about the
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.840]  autopilot, they're trying to program it. That's not gonna work. That's not gonna work. You've
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.520]  already failed. And by the way, most of the globalists have already figured that out.
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.480]  I'm seeing major signs of the power structure of internal civil war and people trying to
[15:26.480 --> 15:32.360]  reverse it and children of elite families understanding now, you're not gonna screw
[15:32.360 --> 15:38.760]  up humanity and get out of this. The only way you're gonna be able to attain the true
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.560]  gifts of the creator, which is all this technology, genetic engineering, all of it.
[15:43.560 --> 15:49.800]  We are creators, little creators, little sea creators to the big sea creator. We're made
[15:49.800 --> 15:56.580]  in the image and likeness of God, okay? I mean, take a look at what we can do. Just
[15:56.580 --> 16:03.040]  got chills right there, just got chills right there. And when what we do sends out ripples,
[16:03.040 --> 16:07.880]  you know, I shouldn't get mad that within three days of us breaking major news every
[16:07.880 --> 16:17.540]  single day, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, you name it, Sean Hannity are covering it.
[16:17.540 --> 16:22.360]  And more and more, they can't even spin it because their audiences demand the truth.
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.760]  And plus, deep down, they don't wanna sell people out. Deep down, they have a survival
[16:25.760 --> 16:32.080]  instinct for their families, their children, their wives, the people they love. You see,
[16:32.080 --> 16:35.800]  that's why they wanna make you automatons and have, quote, zero tolerance and everything
[16:35.800 --> 16:42.840]  where cops are robots, where teachers are robots, where you don't have any discretion.
[16:42.840 --> 16:47.240]  Because they want you to be a robot. You see, that's where all this is going. That's why
[16:47.240 --> 16:53.520]  they're trying to replace us with robots. I mean, I always feel like I should do more.
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.660]  I always feel like I should work harder and stay up late and shoot videos when I'm exhausted
[16:57.660 --> 17:03.040]  that aren't as effective as when I'm actually energized doing it. And it just really came
[17:03.040 --> 17:10.760]  to me this morning, in one of the most azure blue skies I've ever seen with spring breaking,
[17:10.760 --> 17:20.280]  with manifest beauty, to be on this planet staring out into the heavens, I mean, just
[17:20.280 --> 17:22.920]  incredible.
[17:22.920 --> 17:28.600]  That I have already succeeded and you have already succeeded, because the greatest victory
[17:28.600 --> 17:36.440]  is not even getting personal attention. The greatest victory is not yourself being famous.
[17:36.440 --> 17:45.180]  That's actually across the bear. But true real power to do good is when you can do something
[17:45.180 --> 17:51.800]  and have everyone come think they're stealing it and take it and actually put it out to
[17:51.800 --> 17:58.260]  everyone and to be able to change human destiny for good.
[17:58.260 --> 18:02.240]  And to be involved being able to blow the whistle every single day on things that I
[18:02.240 --> 18:06.880]  think are important and that my crew thinks is important, and then others who resonate
[18:06.880 --> 18:16.280]  with it who think it is important. And it's like the fire of Prometheus. I revel in giving,
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.080]  not from the Greek occultic perspective, but it's still a good analogy, the fire of liberty,
[18:21.080 --> 18:26.180]  the fire of awakening, the fire of truth, the fire of building people up and seeing
[18:26.180 --> 18:29.040]  them soar, that is such an amazing thing.
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.540]  And it's why it's so alien to me that other people don't wanna build others up and see
[18:33.540 --> 18:40.440]  them soar because they're threatened by it. That's why the only person in mainstream dominant
[18:40.440 --> 18:51.440]  media who I've seen that doesn't try to dominate and shut down other people is Matt Drudge
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.320]  of the Drudge Report, who has given Infowars the fire of Prometheus.
[18:56.320 --> 19:01.520]  We had already given many the fire of Prometheus on a smaller level, and it set brush fires
[19:01.520 --> 19:12.400]  across the planet. But Drudge and others have given us a greater fire. And so now, infowars.com,
[19:12.400 --> 19:17.480]  prisonplanet.com, this syndicated show, even when it's not on drudgereport.com, as one
[19:17.480 --> 19:24.200]  of our stories is today, it is now picked up by conservative circles, libertarian circles,
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.000]  and is read word for word with no credit.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.800]  And I don't even really mind that when Limbaugh and Hannity do it. Savage gives us credit
[19:31.800 --> 19:37.760]  now. When Beck does it, it's irritating only in that he's tried to hurt us and shut us
[19:37.760 --> 19:44.540]  down and block us while streaming what we're doing. I mean, listen, this show is the Glenn
[19:44.540 --> 19:50.480]  Beck show now. I mean, you understand I'm his teleprompter writer, but I'm writing directly
[19:50.480 --> 19:56.760]  out of history and research and the force of liberty that flows through me. It's amazing.
[19:56.760 --> 20:01.760]  All right, I'll get into the North Korea situation straight ahead.
[20:01.760 --> 20:05.640]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[20:05.640 --> 20:10.320]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[20:10.320 --> 20:14.020]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[20:14.020 --> 20:20.160]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[20:20.160 --> 20:26.160]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.860]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But
[20:30.860 --> 20:36.720]  here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of
[20:36.720 --> 20:42.040]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[20:42.040 --> 20:47.280]  at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google. And the liberal media is doing
[20:47.280 --> 20:51.640]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[20:51.640 --> 20:59.860]  at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.

[24:49.600 --> 24:53.640]  Jones here back live. Thanks for tuning in today. Be sure and spread the word about the
[24:53.640 --> 24:58.520]  local AM and FM stations you're listening to and support their local sponsors. We are
[24:58.520 --> 25:04.360]  fighting an uphill battle, but we have the people on our side, and so the agenda of liberty
[25:04.360 --> 25:11.440]  is moving forward faster than ever. All right, coming up, I'm going to get into the police
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.480]  state news, the economic news, the incredible Second Amendment news, where they are trying
[25:18.480 --> 25:26.000]  to ram through anti-gun legislation without anyone being able to read the bill. Of course,
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  they're saying Harry Reid promised to let us have amendments, but he lied. It's like
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.300]  saying Satan promised not to lie to me, but he did.
[25:35.300 --> 25:39.000]  People go, I can't believe Biden doesn't understand why we want guns to protect ourselves from
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.600]  criminals and the government. Biden says he doesn't understand why we want guns. Why doesn't
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.840]  he understand? Of course, Biden understands. He owns a bunch of guns on record, has bodyguards.
[25:49.840 --> 25:59.120]  He's a gangster. He's got a criminal instinct, an animating contest of evil. He doesn't like
[25:59.120 --> 26:08.000]  you, he wants to dominate you. From the dark side, big time, big time, big time, big time
[26:08.000 --> 26:15.120]  enemy, big time bad, big time eat your lunch, big time usurp everything you've got.
[26:15.120 --> 26:25.040]  But it's virtuous to roll over to tyranny. No, it's not. I mean, look at this right here.
[26:25.040 --> 26:29.680]  Paul Watson did the article today. You need to make this go viral. It's up on Infowars.com.
[26:29.680 --> 26:37.440]  Bill Clinton, the UN, and Donald Rumsfeld. If anybody's like the devil and appears in
[26:37.440 --> 26:43.200]  a poof of smoke, I would imagine it'd be Donald Rumsfeld. I mean, that guy commences, that
[26:43.200 --> 26:49.120]  guy emcees over like all the key evil. He's just as important as Henry Kissinger as a
[26:49.120 --> 26:54.720]  Bigna Brzezinski. I mean, that guy's been around since right after L.L. Lemnitzer got
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.200]  kicked out by Kennedy. He came in right after that. Mr. Falls flag.
[27:07.120 --> 27:12.960]  Who gave North Korea the nukes in the first place? US government, CIA, on record. Just
[27:12.960 --> 27:17.440]  like in a few years when Al-Qaeda is attacking us. And so they're doing proctology exams on
[27:17.440 --> 27:23.520]  you and your family on the highway, not just the airport. It'll because of Al-Qaeda and
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.600]  other groups. You'll be like, you know, our government put Al-Qaeda in charge of all these
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.200]  countries. Shut up, conspiracy theorists. Now remember, everybody knows that now,
[27:31.200 --> 27:36.640]  but by then it won't be politically correct to admit that. But the whole article goes over the
[27:36.640 --> 27:44.560]  admission. Now they have revealed in a leaked intelligence report, which means they did it on
[27:44.560 --> 27:52.320]  purpose, that North Korea states that it has nuclear war is unavoidable as it declares first
[27:52.320 --> 27:58.960]  target will be Japan. So they're saying that the intelligence report says that yes, indeed,
[27:58.960 --> 28:07.840]  ladies and gentlemen, they do have nuclear weapons and can hit Japan and South Korea. Okay, so that
[28:07.840 --> 28:14.560]  is what has now come out and China has been massing troops for weeks on the border there,
[28:14.560 --> 28:25.120]  ladies and gentlemen. So that's the facts. And North Korea is now saying that they will hit
[28:25.120 --> 28:31.840]  Japan first. And they're saying nuclear war is unavoidable. If somebody says I'm gonna come over
[28:31.840 --> 28:37.040]  to your house and shoot you, it's unavoidable and I'm coming over to shoot you. I have every right
[28:37.040 --> 28:42.960]  to have you arrested and if you come to my house to kill you in self-defense. But notice that's
[28:42.960 --> 28:49.280]  not happening. And notice the Pentagon has been secretly meeting with North Korea.
[28:49.280 --> 28:55.680]  In the last month, this guy was raised in Switzerland. And remember,
[28:55.680 --> 29:00.000]  the Global Crime Syndicate manipulates the communist Chinese, put them in power in 49,
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.720]  moved all our industry there. They manipulate the EU, they manipulate our Pentagon, they run our
[29:04.720 --> 29:10.960]  country. And so understand, they clearly, more and more I realize, and I'm gonna get Pachinik on
[29:10.960 --> 29:16.880]  about this to get his take, are actually running this whole thing. It doesn't mean they control
[29:16.880 --> 29:22.320]  them. It means that they have made some deal behind the scenes. I believe we give them oil
[29:22.320 --> 29:28.480]  and a bunch of other food and stuff if they do this. So bower break, carry on the scene.
[29:28.480 --> 29:35.840]  Congressman, they have nukes. Carry contradicts intel report. Pentagon deploys sea radar.
[29:35.840 --> 29:39.600]  We're gonna be breaking all this down. We've got excellent coverage at infoawars.com.
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.640]  Also excellent coverage over at drudgereport.com. But why is this happening now? I'm gonna get into
[29:44.640 --> 29:51.120]  this and then into the globalist master plan. And a lot more. We're on the march.
[29:51.120 --> 29:56.480]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[31:04.880 --> 31:09.280]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a
[31:09.280 --> 31:14.080]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[31:14.080 --> 31:19.440]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.800]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer,
[31:24.800 --> 31:30.160]  and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and

[33:11.520 --> 33:18.960]  we live in. Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958. Earth
[33:18.960 --> 33:26.160]  is being acclimatized. They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere. We are like
[33:26.160 --> 33:34.320]  a natural resource to them. To keep the planet, move on to another. They want benign indifference.
[33:34.320 --> 33:41.920]  They want us drugging. We could be pets. We could be food. But all we really are is livestock.
[33:43.120 --> 33:50.320]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness
[33:50.320 --> 33:59.440]  that resembles sleep. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:59.440 --> 34:05.520]  and the heart of the resistance.
[34:15.600 --> 34:22.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host. It is Friday. I'll be back this Sunday live,
[34:22.320 --> 34:30.960]  4 to 6 PM Central Standard Time. Ben Swann, the very popular Fox News reporter from a
[34:30.960 --> 34:39.280]  Fox affiliate here in the US, has left his job and you're gonna discover why in the next hour.
[34:39.280 --> 34:45.760]  Very popular online. A listener of this radio show took the reports, took the ideas, did his own
[34:45.760 --> 34:55.040]  ideas and really had an effect. And he's leaving there. I know behind the scenes, well, I'm gonna
[34:55.040 --> 35:00.800]  let him tell the story. Okay, cuz I know a few months ago I wanted to have him on and
[35:01.760 --> 35:03.680]  they told him you're not allowed to go on that show.
[35:06.400 --> 35:10.000]  Which is funny, they're putting ads on those videos online that we're getting seen millions
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.360]  of times in some cases. But you don't like local Fox affiliate being on Infowars.com?
[35:15.360 --> 35:20.080]  You don't like being on DrudgeReport.com? You don't like a million people coming to
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.440]  your website when your other videos had like a thousand people coming to them?
[35:24.320 --> 35:30.160]  No, you don't like somebody exposing the private Federal Reserve or the New World Order.
[35:30.160 --> 35:36.480]  I went through the same stuff. On Access TV, they tried to kick me off. And then they tried
[35:36.480 --> 35:42.080]  to kick me off local radio. I was like, well, I have ratings, I'm bringing in money. And they're
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.160]  like, well, you know what? You're gonna shut up or you're fired. And I was like, I thought as long
[35:48.160 --> 35:51.840]  as I was successful and we're not getting sued, and I can prove what I'm saying, I'm allowed to
[35:51.840 --> 35:59.280]  be on the air. They said no New World Order, Federal Reserve, or Bill Clinton. In fact,
[35:59.280 --> 36:04.800]  you do that, maybe we'll give you a raise. Now come out to a company party with us.
[36:07.040 --> 36:09.200]  I went to the company party, but I didn't shut up.
[36:09.200 --> 36:14.160]  So they said you're fired and you'll never be on the air. I was already on the air, out of my house,
[36:14.800 --> 36:18.400]  on a little Patriot network, jacked into a satellite on more than ten stations.
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.760]  And those delusional people couldn't believe it. You see, that's why I hate monopolies. And I hate
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.200]  the folks that engineer the system and think they're gonna control things. They don't control
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.680]  things. The White House doesn't control the narrative anymore. And they bemoan that. They
[36:33.680 --> 36:42.640]  attack the alternative media. Chief among it, the Drudge Report. Because we can show you videos of
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.120]  where they say, yeah, once we register, we're gonna confiscate the guns. And what did the White
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.240]  House say? We hate it when our people speak out of turn and let out the plan. So that's why no one
[36:52.240 --> 36:56.880]  in the media is allowed to talk to any of our people in government. That's why the President
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.680]  doesn't really have press conferences anymore. And it's why we don't talk anymore. It's because
[37:01.680 --> 37:08.000]  of Drudge. The enemy can't even effectively have their propagandist out there talking.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.320]  Because when one of the mayors against gun violence, as they call it, Mayor Bloomberg's
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.800]  anti-American seditious group, gets up in Austin. He says, we're gonna register now and take the
[37:18.800 --> 37:26.960]  guns next. That video goes viral and they're in trouble. Because you guys love to brag,
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.280]  we're here and we're going to show it. And listen, they can't even talk anymore.
[37:31.280 --> 37:37.360]  They can't get us all. I want other people to duplicate what we've done.
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.560]  I want other people to start their own local radio shows and then put them on the Internet.
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.680]  And then do what we've done nationally, internationally, locally.
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.840]  And then once you become successful locally, I suggest you do it locally first. Because that's
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.720]  where there's a real audience for fighting corruption. Cuz see, we're covering national,
[37:54.720 --> 37:58.560]  international. And there's almost a glut of that now at certain levels.
[37:58.560 --> 38:04.240]  You need to cover what's happening locally, then that will become national. I'm consulting for you
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.880]  out there, America. What did the head of the Veritas project a few days ago, O'Keefe, say?
[38:08.880 --> 38:12.800]  He said, he's writing a book coming out. We're gonna sell it about how to do what he's done
[38:12.800 --> 38:17.440]  as a real citizen journalist that brings down federal operations.
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.840]  Acorn was getting something like 6 to 10 billion a year. He blew that operation into 1,000
[38:23.840 --> 38:34.400]  political pieces. Low tech for a couple thousand dollars. Folks, I literally pioneered what they
[38:34.400 --> 38:42.160]  do by necessity, reinventing old fashioned muck raking with the Internet. I'm giving you solutions.
[38:42.160 --> 38:51.680]  The next issue of the magazine is gonna be about solutions and basic ways to fight these tyrants.
[38:51.680 --> 38:58.160]  If you'll just go to globalist meetings that are public, anti-gun, land-grabbing stuff,
[38:58.160 --> 39:01.920]  they'll sit around. If you just sit there and act like you're them going, yeah, we're criminals,
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.840]  we're gonna steal everything. I mean, that's who they are. You can walk into one of these
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.440]  so-called liberal offices and go, hey, let's kidnap kids. And they'll be like, yeah,
[39:09.440 --> 39:14.560]  let's murder them too. I mean, it's like the Acorn stuff where, yeah, I'm bringing in little
[39:14.560 --> 39:18.560]  kidnapped girls to sell them as sex slaves. Great, yeah, we love that. That's a wonderful thing.
[39:18.560 --> 39:25.280]  You know, I'm telling you, these people are so evil. See, most people who figured out the
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.440]  general public are zombies and don't even know what's going on. Most people figure that out and
[39:29.440 --> 39:35.280]  go, well, I'm gonna rob them. I'm gonna steal from them. And once they get a corrupt police
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.400]  force in charge, you can't touch anybody within the city corruption or the corporate corruption.
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.880]  Because, well, that'll bring down the whole system. They're like made men. Those of us
[39:46.880 --> 39:51.120]  that stand down to corruption make all these low-level criminals like made men.
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.240]  And why would you be made in the Italian mafia? Because if you went after that person,
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.520]  a whole organization would come after you. It's like Scientology, where people are scared to go
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.920]  after them because they'll come after you. Even if they went after the federal government, the FBI,
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.360]  CIA, they went after them, broke into their offices, reportedly did dirty tricks.
[40:15.360 --> 40:22.160]  People are scared of Scientology. And it's something L Ron Hubbard set up as a joke for
[40:22.160 --> 40:31.280]  tax exemption just because they had what Tony Montana calls huevos. And I don't break them
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.880]  from nobody. Well, what if good people didn't back down? What if good people got aggressive?
[40:36.880 --> 40:42.320]  And I'm not talking about breaking into the FBI, but just said, come and take it. But more than
[40:42.320 --> 40:47.840]  come and take it, we go out and we take over. We get aggressive. Those two guys in Austin that
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.640]  went to that anti-gun rally, they came over and a woman slapped one of them in the back.
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.320]  Another guy poked him in the leg, got cussed at him. They stood their ground.
[40:56.320 --> 40:59.200]  The police tried to act like the Patriots had done something wrong led by
[41:00.560 --> 41:02.880]  Ace Aveda, who's gonna be in here next Friday, he says, we'll see.
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.000]  And just because they did that, just because
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.600]  they went out there and held up signs saying no gun man. The enemy said, you bet, you'll need that
[41:13.600 --> 41:18.560]  sign soon cuz after we register, after we do what we're doing now, we're gonna make that sign a
[41:18.560 --> 41:26.080]  reality. So you keep that sign, you're gonna need it. And the guy smiled, a little Hispanic
[41:26.080 --> 41:32.960]  version of Dr. Evil. I guess the Hispanic mini-me sits there and points at him and says,
[41:32.960 --> 41:39.920]  I'm gonna get your guns. What an outrageous King George III statement. I mean, what a just Santa
[41:39.920 --> 41:48.400]  Anna, I'm gonna get your guns. Just outrageous like, I'm gonna get them. Mr. And Mrs. America,
[41:48.400 --> 41:54.160]  turn them all in. If you don't engage the enemy, you don't show their strength,
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.160]  you don't show their fire, the cattle won't even know there's a war going on.
[41:58.160 --> 42:04.560]  Engaging the enemy, showing up, getting on the field, you may not be a great fencer the
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.400]  first time you go fencing. You may not be a great wrestler the first time you go and wrestle. You
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.280]  may not be a good boxer the first time you go boxing. But I'll assure you, you get in the arena,
[42:13.280 --> 42:18.640]  you're gonna get better and better and better and better. And folks, I'm just telling you,
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.360]  I'm in the arena. And I may be stumbling around and bleeding and falling over some of the things
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.880]  and it may even be a spectacle, but you know what, I'm in the arena. I'm in the arena all the way,
[42:28.880 --> 42:34.400]  get in the arena. This is a fight with authoritarians and all their slime,
[42:34.400 --> 42:40.080]  they make me sick. You had a neighbor you'd caught stealing potted plants out of your backyard.
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.880]  You came over to their house and said, Bill, that looks like my potted plant right there.
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.320]  In fact, that's a planter we've been talking about for a long time. And you know what,
[42:50.320 --> 42:56.400]  in fact, that's a planter we bought in Mexico. I doubt you cuz he's, that's mine. No, I've had
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.960]  that for years. No, that looks like a plant we bought five years ago in Mexico. I mean,
[43:00.960 --> 43:05.440]  that's a pretty small town. I think that's an original little deal. I bought it from a shop
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.120]  while they were there making them by hand. No, it's not, no, it's not. Well, I'd appreciate you
[43:09.120 --> 43:13.280]  saying that to me that I stole that. You would loathe that person because they were such a
[43:13.280 --> 43:21.120]  despicable liar. And you'd say, okay, you go ahead and you keep that. Of course, all you do
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.440]  is when you finally move out, a few years later you just go over and take the potted plant back.
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.440]  That's actually a true story. I guess the only thing, I said I stole beer out of golf carts.
[43:29.440 --> 43:37.760]  I guess I have stolen my own stuff back before. Anyways, getting back to what I'm saying here,
[43:37.760 --> 43:44.800]  ladies and gentlemen, is that there are people who just want to steal for no reason. My dad,
[43:44.800 --> 43:47.920]  he's telling me when I was a kid, there's people who'd rather steal a quarter from you than make
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.720]  $100. And I go, why, dad? And he goes, cuz they're losers, cuz that's the way they are.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.320]  They think they win by stealing something from you. I've seen people I've worked with,
[44:00.320 --> 44:05.840]  built up, put on the radar so many times just to do the Oedipus complex and make stuff up about
[44:05.840 --> 44:13.840]  me and attack me and go after me or take my faults and exaggerate them. Because they imagine
[44:13.840 --> 44:17.200]  that that's how they build themselves up. That's how you become a big man.
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.680]  No, you build a community and you work with people and you get a name that's trusted.
[44:23.680 --> 44:28.720]  And then everyone who's a winner wants to work with you. When you attack people and lie about
[44:28.720 --> 44:38.640]  them, then only losers want to work with you. And my God, that's a bad fraternity to be in.
[44:39.600 --> 44:43.120]  And it's the same thing with government and bureaucracy. I mean, Homeland Security is
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.920]  saying gun owners, veterans are the number one terror threat. And that wasn't enough.
[44:47.920 --> 44:54.480]  They doubled down, they quadrupled down, they infiniti-ed down and said, gun owners,
[44:54.480 --> 45:05.520]  veterans, you're not just the ultimate terrorist. No, it's all Catholics and all evangelicals and
[45:08.400 --> 45:11.120]  put them next to Al-Qaeda and the army is taught that.
[45:11.760 --> 45:15.200]  And then that freaked everybody out when that, because I reported this a decade ago.
[45:15.200 --> 45:20.000]  Now it's in Fox News, so now it's safe for the state police in Colorado to go,
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.040]  yeah, we're in meetings saying we need to confiscate guns from the Christians and will we do
[45:25.040 --> 45:32.800]  it? This is kind of creepy, kind of creepy. I mean, you're in a room with enemy foreign operatives
[45:32.800 --> 45:38.080]  who've taken over. I mean, it's like aliens landing or something, or Nazis taking over France.
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.880]  You're in a room, I mean, right there, that's the bad guy, obviously. And by the way, we're
[45:42.880 --> 45:48.160]  taking a survey that just came out yesterday. Will you confiscate guns from Christians?
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.400]  Will you see them as a problem during a gun confiscation? And the state police,
[45:52.400 --> 45:59.040]  this is your moment, folks, when the devil takes off the nice guy's suit and it's the devil in a
[45:59.040 --> 46:05.280]  red pajamas with a forked tail going, hi, I'm the devil, hello. And you're gonna work for me,
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.680]  aren't you? Everybody's sitting there going, this is pretty crazy.
[46:10.880 --> 46:14.720]  I mean, it wasn't enough to badmouth George Washington. It wasn't bad enough to badmouth
[46:14.720 --> 46:18.640]  Thomas Jefferson. It wasn't bad enough to say returning veterans will attack every police
[46:18.640 --> 46:24.640]  department in America with IEDs. Remember that five years ago? And I'm like, here's this secret
[46:24.640 --> 46:28.160]  document. I was sent by a federal marshal. They're teaching him that every department will be
[46:28.160 --> 46:32.400]  attacked. Let me check this document. I've confirmed it's real. The feds were hopping
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.320]  mad when I called them that I had it and quite threatening. Police, are you being trained that
[46:36.320 --> 46:42.080]  veterans will attack your department, will, with IEDs in the near future? Open the phones up,
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.400]  every cop calls in. Yeah, they trained us on that last year. We thought it was crazy.
[46:48.160 --> 46:50.960]  That's why cops listen to the show are just immediately listeners,
[46:50.960 --> 46:53.360]  cuz they hear it. They go, yeah, I was told that. How's he know that?
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, there isn't long to turn this around, okay?
[46:59.280 --> 47:05.120]  If you give in to these bullies, it's over. And they are completely out of control. I
[47:05.120 --> 47:08.800]  said I'd get to all these reports. I said I'd get to the true nature of the New World Order.
[47:08.800 --> 47:14.240]  And I don't do this on purpose. Guys, you've gotta make me do it at the start of the third hour.
[47:15.280 --> 47:18.560]  And because I wanna talk about their master plan, where they're going,
[47:18.560 --> 47:22.400]  what they're going to do, what's going to happen, how they've dumbed people down.
[47:22.400 --> 47:36.720]  Because that's the key, that's the heart, that's the central area to all of this
[47:39.920 --> 47:46.480]  is that we are entering a period in society. We are entering a period
[47:46.480 --> 47:52.880]  in our culture where everything is going to accelerate downhill. And the establishment
[47:52.880 --> 47:57.760]  has done the actuaries. They believe they've got a big enough group of people that are so dumbed
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.960]  down. I mean, I saw Mark Dice video. We're gonna play it coming up in the next segment
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.000]  where he goes out and says, will you confiscate? Are you for people being arrested if they own
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.520]  guns? Are you for banning guns? And the people, most of them, sign the petition to do it.
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.080]  And so I'm gonna go out and see if Austinites are that dumbed down. And then he went on and said,
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.000]  did you hear about the US nuking China, blowing up their two biggest cities last week?
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.280]  And people are like, no, I didn't hear about it and I don't care. I mean, that is how dangerously
[48:27.280 --> 48:33.920]  selfish and disconnected and lazy the public's gotten. But globalist, just because you have
[48:33.920 --> 48:44.240]  dumbed down the general public, just because you've been so successful in turning them into zombies
[48:44.240 --> 48:47.920]  and even lowering their brainwaves and reducing the amount of words they use. I've got all the
[48:47.920 --> 48:53.040]  studies I'm gonna cover in the third hour on this front. Just because you've been able to do that,
[48:53.040 --> 49:00.560]  doesn't mean there aren't 70 million guns sold in just the last couple of years.
[49:00.560 --> 49:07.200]  Over 150 million gun owners, I see statistics like 35 million gun owners. I saw that in the
[49:07.200 --> 49:12.080]  New York Times last week, what a lie. It's a minority, it's 35 million gun owners. Ladies
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.400]  and gentlemen, there are estimated 400 million guns of new manufacture since the 1930s. That's
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.920]  considered modern error. I mean, pull up these numbers, it varies. Some are 400, 500 million,
[49:23.920 --> 49:30.240]  but let's just be conservative. Okay, 400 million guns sold in the New York Times last week,
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.080]  400 million guns. And most people when they get a phone survey, do you own a gun?
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.840]  They say, none of your business or no, because they don't trust the system. They know it's bad,
[49:41.840 --> 49:46.160]  they know it's crooked. Our numbers are much greater, so also understand that. So I wanna
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.200]  tell the power structure something which you're fully aware of. Just because you think you can get
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.120]  a bunch of sheep to vote to take our guns and vote to take our bank accounts and vote to take
[49:57.120 --> 50:04.560]  our private property because they think they're gonna get a piece of it. A, will collapse the
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.880]  society faster than you even think and B, there will be what you call collateral damage.
[50:10.880 --> 50:14.240]  There will be a civil war the likes of which you've never seen. And I know you believe you're
[50:14.240 --> 50:19.440]  gonna have it and control it and this will be your decisive war and you've billed Obama as
[50:20.080 --> 50:23.760]  Lincoln too, but this is not going to work the way you think it is.
[50:23.760 --> 50:29.280]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[50:29.280 --> 50:33.920]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to
[50:33.920 --> 50:38.640]  be repetitive about this. It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then
[50:38.640 --> 50:43.840]  only do it every Monday. We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.200]  into thinking about guns in a vastly different way. I mean, is it a free society to turn on
[50:49.200 --> 50:55.360]  sitcoms, dramas, news, and all they do is demonize the family, fathers, guns, liberty?
[50:55.360 --> 51:20.080]  This is an authoritarian group. This is a scientific takeover.
[51:25.680 --> 51:30.880]  But you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[52:03.280 --> 52:07.280]  deaths in 2012 have made Chicago the murder capital of America. Proof that gun control
[52:07.280 --> 52:11.280]  doesn't work. Disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only criminals have guns and
[52:11.280 --> 52:15.840]  Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago machine want to keep it that way. If we can't stop them in Chicago,
[52:15.840 --> 52:19.440]  we may lose the whole battle, but there's hope. On April 9th, we have a chance to
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.000]  send billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Rahm Emanuel and his Chicago machine a crystal clear message
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.480]  that we have a natural right to defend ourselves, our homes and our families and that they need to

[56:39.600 --> 56:44.400]  Korea and we got Pacenik. He finally got back from the DMZ. He's got now he could speak more.
[56:44.400 --> 56:50.080]  He was kind of off record. He was being cased and saying stuff like I've already put my life
[56:50.080 --> 56:55.280]  on the line in combat eight times and, you know, another spy operation. So if something happens to
[56:55.280 --> 56:59.840]  me, that's fine. I'm willing for something to happen to me. So he's probably listening
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.760]  right now. I'm not making fun of his voice, doing an imitation. Do imitation me too if you want.
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.800]  But he's gonna be popping in for about 15 minutes at the end of the third hour today
[57:08.800 --> 57:14.560]  because he was saying it's a false flag. It's a false flag. It's a false flag. I can't say more
[57:14.560 --> 57:20.160]  than that. I've talked to special forces down to Florence. I can't say much more than that.
[57:20.160 --> 57:25.200]  There's three CIA when I was just getting breakfast, sitting around me at the restaurant.
[57:25.200 --> 57:31.040]  I got to watch it, Alex. They're listening right now, Alex. They're breaking into my email, Alex.
[57:31.040 --> 57:38.480]  So when he comes on, he's really a famous black ops guy. Camp David's founding Delta Force
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.560]  writes Tom Clancy books. I mean, he's a very interesting character.
[57:43.600 --> 57:48.320]  And he's gonna be popping in because here's Paul Watson's article. Look at this. Lawmakers
[57:48.320 --> 57:53.280]  drop bombshell. North Korea may have nuclear missiles. Well, no, the intelligence report
[57:53.280 --> 57:58.320]  doesn't say that. It says they've got A-bombs, everybody knows that, but they can only hit Japan
[57:58.320 --> 58:02.480]  and South Korea. That's a public assessment by the British, everybody else. I've been saying it for
[58:02.480 --> 58:09.680]  months because I do my research. I'm not bragging. They've got atomic weapons. Let me say it again.
[58:09.680 --> 58:16.480]  They've got atomic weapons. The private groups, when they do tests in Japan, private universities
[58:16.480 --> 58:20.480]  are able to pick up, even though they're underground tests, it comes out the tunnels,
[58:20.480 --> 58:26.160]  they're able to pick up the isotopes of an atomic bomb. The fingerprint, the signature,
[58:26.160 --> 58:31.200]  the biometric reading, if you want to call it that, even though they've got the spectrometers.
[58:31.200 --> 58:37.760]  Here it is. And now North Korea says nuclear war is unavoidable. I mean, this is incredible.
[58:37.760 --> 58:50.480]  They work for the globalist. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.480 --> 58:56.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.840]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and
[59:01.840 --> 59:06.800]  starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the
[59:06.800 --> 59:13.040]  most vital and important preparedness items at infowarsshop.com. These are items that I did
[59:13.040 --> 59:18.720]  research on that I personally use. You've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into
[59:18.720 --> 59:24.400]  safe water anywhere you go. The Ktor Handcrank Generator to charge up key equipment during power
[59:24.400 --> 59:29.680]  outages or out in the field. Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen. When disaster
[59:29.680 --> 59:34.960]  strikes by Matthew Stein. TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during
[59:34.960 --> 59:40.880]  any radiological event. Handcrank shortwave AM-FM radios. Everything that we've researched and found
[59:40.880 --> 59:46.320]  to be the best is available at infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our info war possible.
[59:46.320 --> 59:50.080]  We're getting prepared. Are you? Infowarsshop.com.
[59:50.080 --> 01:00:05.200]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:12.560]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are two devastatingly important articles up at infowars.com right now.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:37.280]  Treason alert. Dems trying to move gun bill forward without allowing senators to read it.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:44.640]  Obamacare repeat. Senators not allowed to rebuild prior to cloture. This is all treason,
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.760]  ladies and gentlemen. If you don't know Robert's rules, parliamentary procedure,
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.240]  the laws in this country as well. They're just, some of the Federal Reserve was passed by three
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.480]  senators the night before Christmas. Went all through the house. Not a creature was stirring,
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.600]  not even a mouse. Three of them passed the Federal Reserve Act. Notice they got rid of
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:12.800]  our senators in 1913, 17th Amendment. Before that, the state legislature that you elected,
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.760]  think how powerful legislatures were. They voted then to create more separation of powers,
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.840]  more emergency checks and balances, more ties on the government. They, your legislature,
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.200]  your state rep, would vote for the senator. And so they were a creature of the state.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.400]  The states haven't existed. They say it's a civil war. The states after Reconstruction
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.160]  was so abusive actually came back. But that 17th Amendment, I mean, that's put a fork in it.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.240]  But it's not like a person you can just kill. Liberty like phoenixes can rise.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.520]  If you realize, look, a contract that's fraudulent is null and void. All this stuff has been done
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:58.000]  through fraud. It's a fraud. And any courts that say this, any of that are frauds and are relying.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.960]  And so that's the bottom line. And that's what Marbury versus Madison says. I mean,
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.800]  I've studied common law. I've studied law. I've studied history. I've studied it all.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.160]  But law comes out of the organic common sense. I mean, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:18.880]  Declaration of Independence, only points out what is self-evident. Self-evident truths.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:27.760]  We hold these truths to be self-evident. Self-evident that all men are created equal,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.600]  endowed by their creator, with certain unalienable rights.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:42.400]  Inalienable rights, life, liberty, life and liberty. You got your life, you got your liberty.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.440]  Not everybody's as smart as the other person. Everybody's just good looking.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.480]  We all have different gifts. All of you have gifts.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:57.280]  Even people that are handicapped, even mentally, they are giving the gift of a burden to someone
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:05.120]  to grow. Everything's a gift. If God allows me to live another 50 years, that's a gift I certainly
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.960]  ask for and the one I want. But if God allows the enemy to strike me down, that is a gift.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.480]  Because it's going to be done for a greater cause. And that's why I'm at total peace.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.880]  Total peace with my creator, not at peace with the New World Order. Because I just watching them run
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:29.200]  over our people, watching them hurt the innocent, watching them just persecute and persecute and
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.440]  persecute and trample the innocent and trample the honest and trample the virtuous and engage
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.640]  in fraud and lies and abuse and inventing new evil makes me want to throw up.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.280]  The Republican leadership likes to act like the Democrats trick them. 16 Republicans voted
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:56.000]  to take your guns because they are bought and paid for by foreign banks and big corporations.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.240]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all these guys give money to the globalists.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:08.960]  To the globalist minions, the globalist operatives. And they're there financing this. So that's why
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.400]  this happens. The same thing's done in every country. They've got a blueprint,
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.720]  they've got a program, they've got sociologists and anthropologists and psychologists and
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.760]  pitchmen and psych warfare experts and advertising execs that all get together
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:27.440]  in roundtables, a lot of these are public, and talk about, you know, what's going on in the world.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.200]  How to con you, how to hammer you, how to take you over, because that's what they built is fraud.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.480]  You understand, they steal the world. That way they get the woman, they get the power.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.080]  You understand that? But it's worse than that. They want to tie you down because they know you're
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:52.000]  better than them. So they spike your water with poison to retard you so they can rule
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.040]  a world without you. And you know what? They're not going to kill you. They're going to kill
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:07.920]  you. A world in which if you want an American company with American products made by Americans,
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:14.000]  here is the cow Ben soap company. Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for

[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:07.760]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:12.640]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.440]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:23.040]  affected. The fact is, you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:21.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:31.120]  All right, my friends, we're now into our number two. Dr. Steve Pacinek is going to pop in at the
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.800]  bottom of the next hour. He just got back from South Korea on the DMZ, former head of the
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.080]  Pentagon Operations and Psych Warfare, one of the founders of Delta Force with General Boykin.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.840]  By the way, I got General Boykin's number and he wants to come on. Remind me to call him today.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.520]  I was supposed to call him like a month ago. That should be interesting to get his take on all this.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.480]  So much going on. Lawmaker drops bombshell. North Korea may have nuclear missiles. That's not what
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.760]  the report says. It says they have atomic bombs that they can deliver to Japan and South Korea.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.800]  That's been declassified for a long time. This newest intelligence report they're saying is
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:16.160]  classified, but a watered down, unclassified briefing was given to the Congressman.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.200]  The Intelligence Committee can get the highest level security stuff unless the executive tries
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.920]  to deny it, and that itself is unconstitutional. But now it's got out of hand because Congress
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.680]  has advocated their responsibility, handed it over, which is another
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.880]  seditious, treasonous activity. Those aren't just words I use, that's what's happening.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  But if you read the report, they have atomic weapons, they've done tests before,
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:48.480]  they've picked up the isotopes that they've had successful detonations. It's real, they know,
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:55.040]  it's a fingerprint. They can vaporize South Korea's major city, Seoul, of how many millions
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.240]  of people? It's more than 20 million. They can vaporize Tokyo. How many is Tokyo?
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.480]  Is Tokyo one of the biggest cities in the world? And why is our government, yeah,
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.320]  the largest city in the world, why are we putting up? Because I'm not a warmonger.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.800]  I never call for that, you know that. But when you've got North Korea run by a third generation
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.600]  dictator psycho saying, I have missiles, I'm going to attack, I'm gonna blow up your cities.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.800]  And now they've come out today in official release and are saying our first target is Japan.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:35.280]  Our first target is Japan. And they're saying, quote, nuclear war is unavoidable. That's in the
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.640]  Associated Press. North Korea says Tokyo is target number one. I mean, that's like somebody coming
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.600]  to your house with a gun and saying, I'm outside, I'm gonna shoot you in the head.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.000]  But people are like, why isn't our government hitting them? Why is no one hitting them?
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.320]  And I'll tell you why, ladies and gentlemen. And again, as usual, truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.440]  If you go up to infowars.com, you can read this article linked to mainstream news.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.880]  I've been covering this since I was on the air in 1996 when this started.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.360]  Donald Rumsfeld, the head of ABB along with Clinton authorizing it and the UN,
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:17.760]  it was a scandal at the time, signed off on transferring multiple nuclear reactors that
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.760]  allow them to create A-bombs when they could have been given types that you cannot create
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:28.480]  fissile material, purified, enriched uranium for the atomic weapons. And sure, this is 1945
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.600]  technology, but you saw what it did to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Will Japan already hit twice,
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.880]  have to take another hit? I guess to get them out of their depression.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.080]  Here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen, who gave North Korea nukes in the first place?
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.520]  Then we're going to our guest, the US government and the CIA. We're gonna cover this next hour
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.920]  and get into the globalist master plan. And by the way, that's not my opinion.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:12:00.240]  That's AP Reuters, London Guardian, BBC, 15 years ago. This was big news from 96 to 2,000.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.960]  And who met secretly with Kim Jong-un last month, the Pentagon in North Korea. The Chinese
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:15.040]  are massing troops saying, don't you do this, North Korea. It's globalist above China, above
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:20.560]  America, playing us all off against each other. But who's putting Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.040]  publicly? Pentagon, NATO, then saying we gotta take your rights cuz of Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.800]  They got 10,000 heat-seeking missiles. Who gave them the 10,000 heat-seeking missiles?
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.440]  Our government put them in Libya and let them have it, got rid of the ambassador.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.280]  They were at that house getting the missiles at that warehouse facility.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.200]  I mean, man, being informed is incredible. The general public can't even tell
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.840]  what time it is anymore, find their rumps with both hands. And we're sitting here just watching
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.680]  crazy land. And what did the former CEO, I wanna say, it's a Lindsey Williams source.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:01.840]  I know the guy, well, one of the doctors here on this network, Dr. Stan Monteith,
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.680]  actually years ago wanted to check it, so called the sources, and he confirmed it.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.880]  Bonham's dead now, the head of Atlantic Richfield died, if we can say his name,
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.760]  Ken Fromm. But remember three years ago, Lindsey Williams said it's gonna start in North Korea,
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.760]  it's not the Middle East. When our fleet moves over there, get ready, and the fleet moved a
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.880]  year ago over there. All right, enough of that, that's all coming up. We're gonna play this clip
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.640]  after Mr. Swan leaves us. Trees on alert, Dems try to move gun bill forward without allowing
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.160]  senators to read it, red linked on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Former Black Panther,
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.200]  government preparing invasion against the American people. Father sickened by
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.280]  anti-constitutional note from son's school. Yeah, they're making the kids do anti-gun,
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.360]  anti-liberty stuff. DHS to meet with congressmen on ammo purchases.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.880]  Soda ban highlights the hidden hazards, proposed gun control restrictions.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:01.040]  Harry Reid's 100 clip magazine faux pas. Who gave North Korea nukes in the first place?
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.920]  Nuclear bombshell North Korea has news capable of striking neighboring nations in Pentagon.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:11.520]  That's just some of the news up on infowars.com. And there's a Facebook report where they now
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.160]  take control of your phone and control it. That's a good idea with a guy that
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.000]  pump and dumped his people that bought his stock and who calls you dumb efforts if you trust him.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.560]  Hey, dumb efforts, you idiots morons trusting me. We're like, we'll give you all our data.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:34.160]  I mean, it's just, they just think you're so stupid. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.360]  I'm a big fan of him. And he's what I say the best local TV reporter in the country,
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.960]  became a big star on the Internet with millions of views to his videos,
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.160]  Drudge Report linking to it, drudgereport.com, infowars.com.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.920]  And I remember about a month or two ago, I wanted to get him on. He said, well,
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.080]  I'm not allowed to do interviews anymore and I'll be talking to you shortly. And I thought,
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.280]  well, that might mean he's gonna be leaving. And sure enough, he's put out a video,
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.800]  we'll play a clip of it later, but why not just go right to him?
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.160]  He's won both a Edward R. Murrow Award, so that's about as good as it gets,
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.680]  and two Lone Star Emmy Awards. He's hailing from Texas, we're proud of that.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.520]  He has specialized in covering the 2012 GOP presidential primaries, the Ron Paul newsletter
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.400]  controversy in Mexico's drug wars on the Texas border. He's a graduate of Brigham Young University
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.080]  with a master's in humanities at California State University before moving to Cincinnati
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:29.920]  and working for reality check. Swan spent 11 years of broadcast career in El Paso,
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.960]  Texas in KTSM-TV, it goes on from there. And he looks like a cross between James Dean
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.000]  and Audie Murphy. And I tell you, get your butt back down here to Texas and maybe come to work
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.040]  for Infowars. But no, I know you're probably gonna go independent, got a lot of offers.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.640]  We're very excited to have you on with us, Ben. But first off, before we get into that,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.640]  what do you think of the crazy North Korea stuff?
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.000]  Listen, I think you're making some really good points about it. It's very strange when you have
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.800]  all the rhetoric, just consider all the rhetoric that our government has put out regarding
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.640]  Iran and the potential of nuclear weapons in Iran and the possibility that Iran could get their
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.920]  hands on one. The fact that we had an Iraq war over the idea that Saddam Hussein might be looking
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:17.040]  for enriched uranium. And yet you have, for a fact, nuclear weapons in North Korea and everybody
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.440]  saying, don't worry about those guys, they're not gonna do anything, he's blowing smoke.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.840]  It's a very strange kind of discussion back and forth between when you compare, again,
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.200]  the talking points and the rhetoric on one side and then with North Korea,
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.320]  it's a totally different situation.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:36.560]  You're right, I've talked to a lot of experts, they've never seen the rhetoric this hot. I mean,
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.480]  North Korea is saying, we will nuke you, we're loading missiles, we're gonna kill you,
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.680]  we're gonna blow up Tokyo. I mean, right there, they should have already been a hit.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.600]  And I mean, China better just stand back, but it's not happening. And then
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.400]  our government allowed the transfer of the reactors over a decade ago. I mean, this is crazy.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.360]  Well, and you have to keep in mind too that what does North Korea really have to lose here?
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.720]  I mean, at this point, because of economic sanctions against them,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.120]  we know that the people in North Korea are starving. Economic sanctions, as you know,
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.400]  don't really do anything to harm a country's dictator. It just harms the people within
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.880]  that country and it makes people desperate. So why wouldn't North Korea now take some kind of
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.400]  monumental step and use a nuclear weapon? What would actually prevent them from doing that?
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.240]  And when people say things like, this won't happen because consider the Cold War and the
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.120]  Cold War, the Soviets, they didn't wanna get blown up, they didn't wanna get killed.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.680]  Folks in the West, they didn't wanna get killed and so there was this standoff between them.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.800]  It's not really the same situation when you consider where North Korea is.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.960]  They don't really have a whole lot to lose at this point.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.040]  You're absolutely right. We're gonna break in a few minutes. I wanna come back and talk about
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.320]  why you're leaving or what you can tell us about where you're at. I know you're a nice guy,
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.520]  but it's pretty obvious that you were getting a little big for people out there that don't
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:59.120]  want liberty promoted. But I'm guessing there, we'll find out more. But what else,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.480]  after we talk about that, do you wanna get into?
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.120]  There's so much happening. What's your take on all the dishonesty from the Democrats about,
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.040]  oh, we just wanna register your guns. We don't wanna confiscate them when we all know they
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.320]  really wanna take them. Yeah, and that's gonna be a huge issue. This whole issue of Second Amendment
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.320]  and the Second Amendment rights is something we've really been talking a lot about as of late.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.840]  And by the way, I haven't been on your show since you were on Piers Morgan's program.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:30.240]  We were supposed to talk shortly after that and wasn't able to. And it was one of the best five
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.960]  minutes in television I've ever seen. But when you look at the Second Amendment of what's happening
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.600]  right now around the country, it's truly remarkable. Because the rhetoric is such that
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.280]  folks in Washington are saying, we're not gonna take your guns. We're not interested in your guns.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.280]  Listen, if they're being honest, then they should say, forget about all the so-called
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.440]  assault weapons that are out there. And again, I think you brought up this point,
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.280]  what is an assault weapon? Every weapon's an assault weapon. But we don't want the assault
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.800]  weapons. If they really meant that, they leave the assault weapons alone and they go and take
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.440]  away handguns. Because statistically, that's where the majority of gun crimes are committed.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:11.440]  But they're not being honest because they're clearly moving through a process of disarmament
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.400]  and it's taking place slowly. You've pointed it out many, many times.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.080]  They want the guns that can fight back against the tyrannical government, bottom line.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:22.640]  But you made the point, and we had actually made this point a couple of weeks prior too,
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.120]  and I was really glad that you used that moment on Piers Morgan's program to say this to the nation.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.800]  But the bottom line is, when we talk about the Second Amendment, the Second Amendment
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:39.200]  is not about having rifles to hunt with. It's not, it's about matching equal force
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.560]  to government force and to military force. That's what it's there for. You know it, I know it,
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.080]  people across this nation know it. It's a check and a balance, absolutely. Ben
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.600]  Swan is our guest. We're gonna give you his Facebook, Twitter, all his websites and everything.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:58.160]  And I can't wait to see what he ends up doing. He's told me a little bit behind the scenes,
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:24.000]  but we'll see how much he can tell us on air straight ahead.

[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:16.380]  From the Senate where they lied and said you'll be able to put riders on here
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:20.980]  you'll be able to put amendments on here to change it, you know, we promise just give us the vote we want and
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.220]  Now they're not letting them do that and they're not even letting them see the bill
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.440]  Of course, that's what they always do the Senators all know this
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.940]  Republicans need an excuse to take your guns and go the Democrats fooled us
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.580]  They're bought and paid for that's coming up the next segment with Ben swan and a bunch of other news
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:43.420]  Really an amazing newsman. I won the Edward R. Murrow award. He was very very young
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:49.500]  I guess he's been a newsman for 15 years now or so and he's getting ready to leave
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:52.060]  the station that he's currently
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.300]  at
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.380]  Up in Cincinnati, Ohio show. Why are you leaving?
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:04.500]  Where are you going or what? Are you planning right now? Because I know you're in some deep discussions with other folks right now
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:10.800]  What's the plan Ben? You know the plan right now is what we're really looking for is the strongest platform possible
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.200]  When we started doing reality check about two years ago
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:21.620]  Really had no idea how big it was going to get hadn't intended for it to become anything other than just a local news segment
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.660]  But we were given freedom with it and then what a rare thing that is immediate today
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:30.940]  Given the freedom to talk about issues that we thought were important issues and issues that are affecting people all over the country
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:35.220]  And so when we're talking about things like the political race in 2012
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.900]  the stripping of credentials of delegates of
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:43.300]  Delegates being disenfranchised the Ron Paul blackout all of a sudden
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.660]  You know we start blowing up across the internet
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:51.580]  And I come to find out there are millions of people in this country tens of millions who have this Liberty view
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:55.720]  That I thought was really just my own personal view and I wasn't trying to force on anyone
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.720]  Just trying to get people to look at things from a different perspective
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.060]  And certainly as a journalist you know you're not trying to impose your view on people
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:05.300]  But trying to get them to see things just from the paradigm
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:07.880]  But the power structure knows Liberty is popular
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:13.100]  That's why they never want to give give it a chance to get its roots going and that's why they always try to suppress people
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:16.140]  So bottom line did you get told to back off?
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.420]  You know it wasn't so much about being told to back off
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:26.060]  So much as the station has you know they're moving in a certain direction, and they're all you just said not so much
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.220]  They're moving in another direction, but that's how they do it. We don't like this direction
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:36.220]  Let us nudge you be be honest be honest. They told you knock it off. It really wasn't it really was
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.820]  These guys really want
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:44.180]  Cincinnati centric and we want bigger issues and so kind of my view of where it was headed was different
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.660]  It's not they were always very supportive of what we were doing and so I want to want to make that clear
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:54.380]  But it really was an issue of me saying look we're coming to an end of a contract and now it's time to decide
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:59.300]  What to do and I think the best thing to do is rather than trying to stay this path in Cincinnati is to say what?
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.640]  Else is out there. What's the bigger platform because I believe this Alex
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.460]  I believe the majority of Americans who don't know what the Liberty movement is or the Liberty message is
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:11.540]  If you articulate it to them, they'll say yeah
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:15.540]  That's me and so what we're trying to do is just open up people's minds and say listen
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:19.260]  Maybe you are of this mindset. You just don't know it yet. I like sure man
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:25.640]  I mean America is asleep right now by and large big sections have been woken up your own big alarm clock going off
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.460]  And I saw in the news you were highly rated probably one of their most popular shows
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:38.820]  and I think there's some professional jealousy one thing I've noticed is especially when you're in you know a a just a local area you'd
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.500]  Think the best horse in the race would be popular the truth is
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:48.120]  There's a lot of professional jealousy that goes on and I'm not trying to get you to throw your colleagues under the bus
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:52.500]  But I mean come on all they really care about is ratings you were delivering ratings
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.140]  So I think that's a bunch of bull that oh just do local stuff
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:00.860]  Yeah, I can't I can't argue with you about that cuz our ratings were fantastic and moving up like crazy
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:05.560]  So we were doing extremely well, and I hope they continue to do well, but again
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.780]  I think it's just it's an issue now a platform and where's the next best thing in fact one of it
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.740]  We're gonna take a minute
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:13.720]  I think you have a video there, and I don't know if you guys plan to play any of that
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.740]  But one of the things I'm trying to do is get input from people
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:22.280]  Who have supported me over this time to give me input on what the next step is and so we actually created a survey
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.100]  I started a new website
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:28.380]  It's been swan.com folks can go there and take a survey, and I know there are people who are concerned about data mining
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:31.100]  We're not data mining you we're not trying to get your information
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:35.260]  So you want to get their feedback on what direction they want to see you go. That's smart smart move
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:37.380]  Yeah, that's what we want
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:40.620]  We want to know what people think and whether or not they're willing to continue to support listen
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:44.660]  You are a guy who is pioneered in many ways independent media in this country
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:48.700]  I mean you've you've done things that nobody else had done before you and you've really blazed the trail
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:52.020]  What we want to do is find out if there's support for kind of the direction
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:56.900]  We want to go in and really one of the things we're focused on is how do we kind of translate?
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.020]  Streaming sites because they're popping up everywhere
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:04.940]  How do we translate that to make that kind of the the forefront of the Liberty movement battle for media?
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.380]  Absolutely we're gonna come back and play a little bit of that video
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:12.060]  And then I'm gonna get into the gun issue with you, but I mean you were telling me off air
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.480]  You're looking at going totally independent even though you've got offers
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:17.540]  Right we have offers and we're talking to some different folks
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:21.100]  And we may do a kind of a combination where we work some with some some bigger media
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.980]  But also have the freedom to go independent
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.940]  Yeah, well I mean I knew about this you know a week or so ago that this was happening and hadn't really called you
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.940]  But I told you during the break

[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.500]  More and more is tuning out of it
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:37.180]  So MSNBC top show million viewers CNN top show half a million viewers. Ladies and gentlemen, there are over 1 million listeners
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:39.260]  That's a conservative number an hour

[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.580]  In one week, it's more like 20 million now, but I just I'll say 15
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:56.740]  Took my brain automatically lowers numbers. The point is is that it's the opposite. I catch a 10-pound fish. I think it's 7 pounds
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:00.620]  It's 15 million. How are they going to deal with that?
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.980]  How are they gonna the the answer is they want to bring an internet to that shuts down the old web as you know it
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:11.460]  Internet ID internet taxes. I mean, they're calling it extremism to criticize the government

[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.980]  You're I mean that's not gonna work
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.940]  Saying we're all terrorists because the people that know how to tie their shoelaces that go to work every day
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:23.040]  That are informed know that America has been taken over
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:29.400]  Now you may have all the dumbed-down TV heads out there that are getting dumber by the day. Those people don't count. I
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.440]  Mean that's like telling my dogs to clean the house or cook dinner. I
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:42.000]  Mean, they're not even really people. You know, the globalist call the general public animals. It's really true the general public
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:50.160]  It's not just the programming and the bad food and the toxins in the water and the dumbing down people once they get a liberty
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.840]  Want to be lazy. I'm going back to our guest here. My point is spread the word about info wars calm
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.940]  spread the word about prison planet calm because we are a
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:05.480]  Launchpad a fulcrum. That's all I do is try to get other media people on other folks and promote what they're doing
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.120]  Because I understand that I'm not trying to be king daddy here
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.760]  And I don't say this to talk about myself
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:18.800]  It's a philosophy for you as well because I know it's the real philosophy that'll free us. I'm trying to raise everybody up
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:26.560]  I need more people more x-wings going in against the Death Star instead of 20 x-wings. We need a thousand ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.120]  We might be able to do with 20 x-wings, but the point is a thousand x-wings. We're taking this thing down
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.240]  You've got to decide you're getting in the x-wing
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:36.080]  You got to decide you're gonna win after the enemy and to do that
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:42.200]  You've got to support and speak out and promote people that tell the truth and buy from us because we're self-funded
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:48.360]  It takes me up to six seven million dollars a year to fund this operation selling books t-shirts sponsors
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.600]  You name it and we're very picky what we promote. We have the seed center. Now. We're gonna add every great seed
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.640]  We're testing and and working with people on non-hybrid non-gmo like the survival seed vault
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.600]  We have the best deal on this at the info war seed center at info wars
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.260]  Store calm and everything we promote is win-win-win
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.560]  Plant a spring a summer a fall garden
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:13.960]  Eat that food can it give it to friends and family get outside
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:19.520]  Don't watch as much television kids are outside half as much as they were 20 years ago. I'm gonna cover that next hour
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.520]  They are killing our society get back to the earth get outside go exercise
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.340]  That's how you defeat the new world order turn off the iPad turn off the iPhone
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:35.000]  Get away from the mainstream television and support local AM and FM stations that carry this show
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:38.600]  The high quality water filters the storeable foods the books the videos
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:45.880]  It's a war and you buy your war bonds at info war store comm or by calling eight eight eight two five three three one three
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:51.920]  Nine now Ben. We've got this video Ben swan. He's leaving his hit TV show in Fox and Cincinnati
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:57.280]  That's become a national sensation. I know we carry all the stuff at info wars calm and and and Ben
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.480]  I'm ranting here about supporting the alternative media talk a little bit about that what you see happening in the media
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.120]  Replacing the mainstream media and then talk about the video. We're about to play well
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:14.040]  I think you're making some really good points there because the bottom line is that you're watching this the steady erosion of viewership and listenership
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.640]  To typical mainstream media and yet the average person is still very much
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:24.600]  Under the impression that this is all there is out there the internet as you pointed out you have all these internet
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:30.200]  you know protection bills for intellectual property like SOPA and PIPA and CISPA and
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.720]  International treaties like ACTA and those those bills are really not designed as you know
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:41.400]  To do anything to actually protect intellectual property. They're designed to control information on the internet so that it creates less competition
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:49.000]  And what we're really seeing now is that there is a phenomenon happening that mainstream media never could have seen coming even 20 years ago
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.360]  And and through the internet through streaming services and on all these different platforms that are now available
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:59.720]  I mean information is flowing to people in ways that like never before and people are turning away from
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:04.680]  Traditional media even entertainment media simply because they want to be able to pick and choose
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:09.400]  And so if you're an American under the age of 40 many of them don't even have cable anymore
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.520]  You have a Netflix and you have Hulu and you're going straight to those sources for even for entertainment
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.680]  So what we're seeing is there's an opportunity now to say listen
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:25.000]  there's never been a time like this where you have opportunity and you have technology that have kind of come together at this moment a
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.180]  growing Liberty movement that does not have a voice in mainstream media and it's growing like crazy and we
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:34.560]  You know, we didn't really choose to be here. This has kind of been thrust upon us
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.880]  But we want to do something with it
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.080]  We want to be responsible with the opportunity that we have and do something that's going to change the way people view things here
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.320]  In America, you're right
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.160]  and again
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:50.600]  There's a window because he even seen it has to admit and Google that all these bills and all these treaties are
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:57.280]  Meant to quote bring in Chinese style net censorship Russian style censorship taxes internet IDs
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:02.200]  It's extrajudicial where they just ban you from the web and three strikes true
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.280]  authoritarianism
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.400]  With the Pentagon running it. I mean it's nightmare
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:14.040]  so now is the time folks to appreciate things like drudge report calm or Ben swan calm or
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.740]  Info wars calm or prison planet TV like we're on Roku. We're on boxy
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.440]  There's hundreds of thousands of people a week. Just watching us on that now hundreds of thousands a week
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.880]  Just watching us on the news the radios millions using the old media format
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.960]  but but but see talk radio is the only old media that's still doing okay compared to the other dinosaur media because
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:41.280]  Because it's outside the old box of censored teleprompter control. It's real open freeform
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:46.400]  So that's why talk radio is something the system also wants to censor. So it's kind of that
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.400]  That wild card go ahead
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:52.200]  Remember it was in the late 80s though talk radio was all but gone
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.720]  And it was when talk radio kind of was reinvented
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:02.000]  It was the new advent of talk radio with creating conservative voices and Liberty voices that suddenly began to emerge
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.120]  That talk radio made a comeback and has remained as you said very strong over the past number of years
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:13.480]  But it was almost gone as a media simply because it had become really irrelevant to the national conversation
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.560]  And it became relevant again, and that's what's happened with mainstream media is is despite their best efforts
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:25.200]  They're just they're just irrelevant to where most people are they spend way too much time talking about things like Lindsay Lohan and not
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.120]  talking about issues as you said about internet control or
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:33.160]  Taxation or second and general person in your rights your drone strikes on American citizens
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.960]  They won't talk about those issues and therefore made themselves irrelevant
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.300]  Well, you're right a few years ago. I was given the talkers trailblazer award
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:44.220]  You know like their first place award
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.380]  I forget the exact name of it was on the cover of their magazine
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:53.820]  And that's the big insider publication for talk radio, and I got there and spoke to like the other main executives of talk radio
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:58.880]  And all I said to him was your children have no future if we don't meet the new world order
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.980]  I'm not gonna get up here and tell you how I've been so successful
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:09.460]  How have I been successful using every venue I could to warn people about attacks on our Liberty because I take it personal and sure
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:16.380]  Okay, well you already know the answer passion focus research telling the truth not caring what people think about me being real
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:21.700]  Okay, that's what will make you successful and talk radio you guys already all knew that there
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.540]  I am in a room full of the top executives
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:27.420]  You know only a couple hundred of them, and and and I said you already know the answer now
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:30.940]  I'm gonna tell you the rest of the answer if you don't get on the ball and
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:34.100]  Stand against the new world order. They're gonna take everything
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:37.460]  They're not gonna just take our guns and then not take your bank account of your pension
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:43.420]  They're not just gonna. You know take our liberties. You know when it comes to travel and not make you take inoculations
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.860]  Okay, I said bottom line
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:54.420]  Bottom line you better understand. What's happening go ahead Ben. No you're absolutely right
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.900]  I mean at the end of the day media you have to remember that this fourth estate. That is the press
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:04.060]  Obviously at the time of the founding, but is now media in America really has a responsibility
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:08.220]  We have a job and our job is to hold power in check
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:13.100]  And media gave that roll up a long time ago because they really became controlled by those powers
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:17.700]  And so they've become an entertainment function or in some cases a propaganda function
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:22.640]  Of political parties and powers that be and so you have this situation today
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:27.020]  where there's almost as you're talking about this new advent of
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:33.860]  Of the fourth estate where but it's because of the internet because information is able to be passed the mainstream media
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:41.740]  Created a vacuum by becoming total repeater mouthpieces to the point of the White House saying we're not gonna even have press conferences anymore
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:47.860]  We'll just give you a press release because we've got our own system. I mean the mainstream media is making itself obsolete
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:55.580]  Well, they absolutely are but I'm sure you saw that I believe it was vice president Biden telling CNN or snow wasn't excuse me
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:02.420]  It was a he thanked MSNBC, but a senator who thanked CNN for helping them to push this gun bill through the Senate
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:09.300]  And thanking them for spending I guess two days of covering this and trying to really make this case on behalf of the White House
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:13.300]  When instead it should be CNN that's standing up to the White House and saying, you know
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.380]  Why is it the Senators aren't reading bills?
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:16.740]  I know we're gonna get into this in a minute
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:21.780]  But you know how do you have someone like Senator Mike Lee who's standing up and saying that not one single?
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:26.740]  Senator has read the amendment that was issued by Joe Manchin and Pat to me
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:32.860]  Now one single senator had bothered to read it. How are you all passing laws in this country that you haven't read?
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:38.400]  We're gonna play that in a moment. They're not even letting him see it now that videos up on info Wars calm
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:42.320]  But I mean take amber lion. She's won all these Emmys
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:46.080]  She she's going all the world of war zones and then she can't go
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:50.020]  To these different Middle Eastern countries where the West is in charge running death squads
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:53.860]  Shooting men women and children and then she learns. Well, you didn't know
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.500]  They've bought out your TV show
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:59.460]  It's now funded by the you know
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:05.820]  Government of Qatar or the government of and and she found out they that it turned out CNN and CNN International
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:10.420]  Isn't just advertisers the shows aren't just owned by the US government
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:15.420]  They're owned by foreign governments and now the communist Chinese say you can't release
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:22.200]  Red Dawn, you know remake crit with us in it. And and by the way, you you've got a re-edit World War Z
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:27.840]  You can't show outbreaks in China when it's about it outbreaks everywhere. So it's not just the globalist now
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.560]  It's even foreign countries. We're wide open
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:35.000]  I mean America is like a giant whorehouse and they've already sold us out
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:40.060]  Like we've got a you know, go into a bedroom with a new world order and I got news for you
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:44.960]  You know, you're not selling me out. Okay, go ahead. No, you're you're absolutely right
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:50.160]  I and that's the issue that I think people have awakened to that. They're not interested in it anymore
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:54.520]  I think anyone who's awake at all was saying this and we understand that that none of this is
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.400]  Legitimate that what media is telling us
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:01.160]  They're just propaganda wings of either political parties or governments
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.100]  when you have Secretary of State at the time Hillary Clinton talking about the fact that that the
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:11.800]  CCTV out of China and that Al Jazeera TV and that Russia Today RT were
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:15.400]  Really as she was describing them like effective
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.560]  Propaganda tools on behalf of their governments saying our media here isn't effective enough as a propaganda tool
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:30.180]  And so we need to actually be investing in state media in the United States and you're thinking I thought they were pretty effective
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:34.120]  I mean, I thought CNN was pretty good at putting out this message on their behalf
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.520]  But apparently not good enough in her mind
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.320]  But what I think they're really saying is that that we can't have the alternative voice to it
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:44.080]  And that's why right now is a time like no other and I know you know this Alex
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:49.080]  but it's a time like no other in American history where information is here and the
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.040]  Technology is here to get messages out to the masses
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:56.600]  But the only way that happens is that people get behind it and support it and make it happen
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.480]  Just like folks have supported you for it for a long long time. Absolutely what we're saying here to the listeners
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.260]  I know most of our listeners get this but there's people that kind of passively listen by the millions
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.280]  You either get active or become slaves and and we've got a chance to win this
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:15.600]  Because the globalists know because a large portion of the public are like zombies that that allows them to take over
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.200]  But it's almost an attribute that so many are zombies because there's a ton of Liberty lovers more than there are globalists
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.400]  We can take back over as well and build a new media to actually free the zombies
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:33.760]  And I mean the general public is becoming zombie like we're gonna go to break and come back and play your video piece
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.920]  But first since you mentioned it here is the video of Senator Mike Lee saying nobody
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:45.000]  Has read the bill treason alert Dems try to move gun bill forward without allowing senators to read it
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:51.520]  Obamacare repeat senators not allowed to read the bill prior to cloture here. It is shells do not address
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:54.280]  You see mr. President
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:01.520]  These are the rights that we're trying to protect by requiring a 60-vote threshold on any new gun control legislation
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:07.320]  And in so doing we're trying to prevent the ability of members to push through legislation
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:12.200]  legislation before anyone has had time to read and evaluate the language and
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:19.000]  Then tell the American people what that language means for them what that language would mean for their rights
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.960]  Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are faced with today
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:30.800]  Yesterday senators to me and Manchin announced a proposal a new proposal. That's widely expected
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:36.160]  to replace the current language on the background checks in this bill and
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.160]  Yet as of this morning as of this very moment
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:46.240]  Not a single senator has been provided the legislative text of that very provision
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.080]  Because the background check measure is the centerpiece of this legislation
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.880]  It's critical that we all know what's in the bill before we vote on it
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.000]  Ben I mean more importantly than even talking about reading the bills. That's obviously central
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.640]  The they're disingenuous the Democrats are all on record saying they want to register to confiscate. It's not like that's a secret
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:14.520]  That's right. Well, and it's it's the Dems are very clear on what they're doing
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520]  But the Republicans are to listen Mike Lee
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.200]  Rand Paul Ted Cruz all three senators had originally said that they were going to do what they were going to
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.920]  filibuster this issue the same way they did with the
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:31.240]  Nomination of John Brennan in order to bring this information to the American public that 13-hour filibuster by the way on drones
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.080]  We did a piece on this. There was a 50-point swing in
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:41.120]  American opinion on the right of the president to kill US citizens overseas with drones
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.120]  Who were suspected of terrorism a 50-point swing within two weeks after that filibuster?
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:52.000]  And so they were threatening to do the same thing again here and it was Republicans 16 Republicans who actually
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.520]  Prevented that filibuster from taking place. Absolutely all of them
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.480]  Again, that's why they're so afraid of it. If one senator stands up if one good man
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.400]  and
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:08.000]  We need every good person to come to the aid of liberty in our country right now because it shows we have power
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.880]  We have the right on our sides
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.880]  But we're in a sea of deception where nobody will stand up and that's why I commend you leaving your lucrative job at Fox
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.960]  To go start your own operation or go somewhere else to have freedom bin because that's what's gonna happen
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:28.340]  It's like Bonjino that you know top of the Secret Service leading details a star in it leaves because of the collectivism
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:31.860]  When Obama was sitting there brainwashing children about how great communism is
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:36.380]  He just couldn't do it anymore and quit and it's that decision saying no
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:41.020]  We're not gonna be part of this lie with you that will lead the sheep out of bondage
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:44.620]  Well, I think that's that's where and that's where we're at
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:47.120]  We really want to be able to be a voice as I mentioned
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:51.600]  You know, that's that's speaking truth to people and truth speaking truth to power
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:56.920]  And that's where it's not just us as you mentioned you just you need people all over the name
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.560]  Absolutely, then swan stay there going to break coming back

[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:18.780]  Hey guys this one here
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:25.300]  Okay, so by now no doubt you've heard either through Facebook or on the web someplace or from a friend that yes in fact
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:31.740]  I am leaving Fox 19 here in Cincinnati the question is where am I headed and a lot of you have been asking?
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:35.100]  Tell me where are you going? Are you going to a network? Are you headed off to the blaze?
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:39.060]  A lot of people are asking me that are you gonna go independent a lot of questions about it?
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:41.180]  Look be honest with you right now
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:42.980]  I'm talking to a few different folks
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:48.940]  But I really want your input on this because when I came to Cincinnati two years ago, I'll be honest with you
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:54.700]  I had absolutely no idea what was gonna take place and we started this thing called reality check and
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:55:00.640]  Thought this would be a great way of putting out some news content that other people weren't doing I had
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:04.740]  No clue that reality check would explode the way that it has
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:09.520]  The best thing about it though to be honest with you is that it connected me to you
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.980]  By far the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me in my career. So as I take this next step
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:17.900]  I'll be honest with you. I want your input
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:22.740]  I want to know how you feel about the message that's been put out and what the next step should be
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:25.400]  It's gonna weigh heavily into that decision
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:30.020]  And the best way for me to get that input is not through somebody going on Facebook and giving me their ideas
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:36.180]  It's actually for you to do me a huge favor and go over to my brand new website Ben swan.com
[01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.600]  It's super easy to find and when you get there take the survey
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.180]  We have a few questions on there to get your input
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:48.540]  Find out a little bit about you and about where you think this next step should lead look. I've said it before I
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:52.340]  Am a huge fan of the people who would say they were my fans
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:57.820]  I appreciate the content you guys send me the things that you've said in the past the support you've given
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:04.060]  The story ideas that you've that you've given me the education. You've helped me to get I think we're a pretty good team so far
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:09.100]  So go over to my website Ben swan.com take that survey. It'll take just a few minutes of your time and
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:12.300]  We'll get back together very soon. I'll see you then
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:17.220]  All right. There you go. And people always ask me. Why do I promote other Liberty oriented medium?
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.900]  I do it because we don't have a future if we don't and it's funny you mentioned back in there
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:23.980]  I think I told you like six months ago off air
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:28.580]  I said I wouldn't be surprised if Beck doesn't offer you a job because I know he's building a whole network off
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.400]  Basically ideas I put on there, which is fine. I think that's great
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.780]  And just my only painful thing is hearing something him reading word-for-word
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:41.980]  Infowars articles then telling his listeners don't trust Infowars. I mean I see it all the time every time I tune in
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:45.420]  It's and it's insane, but it's funny. You mentioned back there
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:47.420]  I don't want to go off into that whole discussion
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.380]  But you were telling me off here
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:54.220]  You're probably gonna go independent and I think that's probably the best move and then just have your stuff out there everywhere
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:57:02.020]  But you know, you could go into Dallas. It's just that I don't think you're you're quite a feminine enough to join his sidekicks
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.020]  I'm sorry
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:11.740]  It's a joke it makes them mad they hate me they're listening right now. Hi Glenn the cover cover my stuff tomorrow on the air
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.340]  I'm sorry, go ahead
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:17.540]  No, you know, you know Glenn Beck show is my show. I mean the truth is it's my show
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:23.320]  So, I mean I like it actually I just know because a lot of people have assumed that that's the place and I'm not sure
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:28.060]  Why in fact to be honest with you? I mean, I've never never had a conversation with Glenn Beck
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.900]  No, no, no, he would be would be intimidated by that
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:35.020]  I actually told you that off air to six months ago, but he was smart he would but but let's go back here
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:38.160]  I mean, come on that you see you're probably gonna what moved to San Antonio
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.420]  I'm guessing we I guess you got family and then you'll be down here in a few months doing your own thing
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:45.940]  Well, and the question will be yeah what it looks like ultimately
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:49.340]  I mean we were working one of the things you're gonna find on the survey if you go over there and you take that
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:51.860]  Survey is we're considering, you know, trying to launch something
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:58.780]  Possibly through Kickstarter to do some crowdsourcing and you get together, you know a plan to put something together and put out
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:01.940]  Some content that we think was going to be really important for people
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:08.140]  That'll be information will be educational and then taking that content and like I said getting into streaming services getting it out
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:14.380]  There where people can see it because you know, one thing that we're really about is really trying to open up people's minds
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:16.300]  I almost see us as the bridge between
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:21.740]  mainstream and alternative media and saying there's a lot of good information over here guys that you're missing because
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:24.500]  You're watching the wrong things and hey, you know what?
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:27.220]  We're gonna break for one minute come back and do five more minutes with me
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:32.500]  I want to show you a few articles been that you'll never see in the mainstream that I'd like you to cover when you launch
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:38.300]  Your own operation there goes my voice going completely out folks. All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us

[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:29.220]  All right, here's stories you'll never see in
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:36.700]  establishment megaphone prostitute media known as mainstream media really dying carcass state run New World Order run
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:42.880]  Vending machine media really vending machine media because foreign governments just China
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:47.600]  Qatar Saudi Arabia. Hey, we'll give you half a million dollars. Don't let
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.860]  Don't let your reporter criticize. We're lining people up and shooting them
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:56.120]  Amber Lyon get rid of her and put few coins in
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:59.320]  Ben swan is here the answer
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:05.040]  The answer is move move in an exodus away from these people here
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:11.040]  Here's an article you never see Italian Supreme Court president blames Bilderberg for terrorist attacks strategy of tension
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:18.480]  Their head of their CIA has gone public saying they're staging terror attacks as a pretext to destroy Liberty worldwide that they have the documents
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:23.480]  You think you'd see that mainstream news also who gave North Korea nukes in the first place?
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:27.680]  We have links to ten-year-old mainstream news articles, but you won't see this now
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:35.320]  You see but but you will see somebody like Ben swan cover it. So then Fox tells him. Oh, no, just do local stuff Ben
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:42.240]  Would you cover stuff like this once you launch your own operation or is that the ravings of a fascist? No, no, absolutely
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:45.600]  Listen, I think I'm especially intrigued by the way by this
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.640]  article you guys have up about who gave these
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:53.320]  nukes into North Korea in the first place and listen what part of what we do too is because
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.920]  What we really try to do is stay away from editorializing. Obviously, we have a little bit different brand and what we do
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:03.800]  but one of the things that we're really about and I love what you guys have done with this is we try to go back and
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:10.240]  Find sources and find facts from the past because one thing that media does not do a very good job of is ever going back
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.440]  And say hey, what did we say about this five years ago or ten years ago or 20 years ago?
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.400]  It's the same concept with al-qaeda. You mentioned this before al-qaeda in Syria
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.360]  Well go all the way back to al-qaeda being created with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:29.720]  Exactly in the late 1970s early 1980s and yet media forgets that conveniently today
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:35.680]  they never talk about those issues today never discuss the fact that our government funded this and created it and
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:39.160]  Today, we're repeating history all over again
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.280]  you're right and
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.720]  At a certain point it's it's got to stop because
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.940]  We see cultures throughout history go crazy and and you know, I talked a lot of mainstream media people
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:55.960]  They don't like what's happening either. They don't like being on a short leash
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.520]  Yeah, well, no they don't and there's a lot of really good reporters out there
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.280]  It's smart reporters and they understand that at the end of the day
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.720]  They have to do what they're ultimately told to do
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:08.040]  And I think that there's more and more
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.440]  people kind of pushing back against that and moving away from it and again
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:15.720]  It's it's things like access through the internet and there's just a lot of platforms out there
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:20.360]  so, you know one of the most important things we do groups like campaign for liberty have talked a lot about the
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:26.800]  Absolute necessity of keeping the internet free of government control and it's vitally important that that happens
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:33.560]  I think your listeners absolutely know that but again where I feel like we we play a service here is to go out and find
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:34.560]  Folks who don't know it
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:38.600]  You know exactly everybody's got to promote liberty and go out and wake other people up
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.480]  Obama's got a rally people to try to take our guns. He needs that grassroots
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:47.320]  Look at how the White House senior adviser to Obama came out and said we hate Drudge Report
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.720]  We can't even talk because of him picking up what we say
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:57.280]  Well, you're the one saying it that shows how pathetically weak the little man behind the curtain is but getting back to this North Korea thing
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.480]  Before you leave in a few weeks
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:07.040]  You're stationed there come to him and say what I can't cover North Korea threatening to nuke America. Does it that affect Cincinnatians?
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.400]  Locally and then you know do a reality check on the fact that our
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:18.200]  Government and others help give the fissile material to North Korea. How could they say no to you on that?
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:22.360]  You know, I'll absolutely do that. I'll absolutely do that story. We'll do it this next week
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:30.040]  We do them Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays. And so absolutely we'll do that story because again, you know the station for us as we're going out
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.160]  You know, obviously they have their direction that they're going in and they've never really suppressed anything. We've done
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.840]  I don't see them suppressing this so I think we'll be okay with it, but I'll definitely do the story because as you guys are
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:44.640]  Pointing out you've got great. You've got great information here and sources and these aren't wild conspiratorial sources
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.440]  These are wait a minute. Somebody else has something to say somebody else playing
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.400]  Yeah, they have something to say to Alex. Joan you piece of garbage. I
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.040]  Don't know what your deal is

[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:11.720]  Costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone in 2012

[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:14.580]  All
[02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:21.840]  Right at the bottom of the hour we're gonna look deeply at who gave the nukes to North Korea
[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:27.340]  You're not gonna see this in the dinosaur kleptocrat vending machine media
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:30.180]  I call them vending machine because whoever puts money into them
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:35.340]  They'll say whatever the other buyers tell them to say the PR media the propaganda media
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:38.700]  I'm gonna be breaking that down at the bottom of the hour North Korea
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:45.980]  I'm saying they've loaded a bombs on top missiles are preparing to blow up. I mean I've got the quotes right here
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:51.540]  They're gonna blow up Tokyo the most populous city in the world how many people live in Tokyo like 30 million or something I?
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:58.420]  Mean I would be pretty angry, but you know what I've heard pundits on Fox News said the Japanese ought to be thankful for
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:00.100]  Fukushima
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:06.860]  Because radiation is good for him and culture said that and she said she wasn't joking so I would suggest and culture go get on
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:12.260]  Top the highest skyscraper in Tokyo and say kim jong-il fire the missile
[02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:14.780]  I'm about to really get some health here
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:19.580]  These people are so out of control man
[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:23.060]  But I got to tell you I've kind of gone over the mountain
[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:26.380]  Just where I'm at peace
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:30.740]  There's the last few weeks. I've been so upset about everything and just so worried about everything
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:33.540]  and you know what God's in control and
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:35.540]  And
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:41.380]  Whatever is gonna happen is in God's plan and God's plan is for all of us though to speak out and be involved
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:47.660]  Because physically what happens to us. You know we probably can't control all that, but spiritually we can and
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:52.660]  You know I'm not telling you what to subscribe to you know religiously or anything
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:56.220]  I understand if you don't feel God's presence something's wrong with you
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:01.700]  Let me tell you there's like a lot of zombies out there in the population and
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:05.380]  And that's what I want to talk about now is
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:11.380]  Consciousness you can just type into a search engine brain waves of the average Westerner are dropping
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:14.300]  TV Alzheimer's connections
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:23.180]  Neurological disorders the English language is growing in words and popularity, but the amount of words used is shrinking
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.700]  People aren't communicating you go to a restaurant
[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:31.420]  Every kid in the place is on an iPad or iPod the parents aren't talking. They're on an iPad or iPod and
[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:39.060]  They're not even researching news or info. They're like you know looking at entertainment stuff the IQs are dropping. That's physical
[02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:41.900]  In fact guys print me an article on that right now
[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:45.700]  IQs dropping in the West sodium fluoride in the waters a
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:52.740]  Harvard study on average a 15 to 20 percent IQ reduction if you live in a city that's fluoridated and drink it as a child
[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:56.740]  I mean these are facts a stubborn things
[02:10:56.740 --> 02:11:03.620]  They are that we are under this mass mind control system where they turn up the social engineers in their own words
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:06.460]  the ambient level of
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:09.380]  distractions diversions in fighting
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:13.220]  Cultural poison, I mean I was watching this morning
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:15.460]  There's a story up on info Wars calm about Kesha
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:21.420]  and I hadn't really ever followed her and I watched a couple of videos and it's teaching 14 year old girls how to commit suicide and
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:26.940]  Songs about committing suicide having her fans send in you know their teeth to wear around her neck
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:30.900]  and how she loves Satan and the devil and you know all this and
[02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:36.700]  They're not just doing this to be cool. This is the spirit of the age. This is how do we hurt the youth?
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:42.020]  How do we screw them up so bad they roll over to us to bring in the control grid?
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:44.580]  I'm gonna break down what the control grid is
[02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:48.300]  After we play this video
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:52.700]  Now you know I've been doing man on the street for a long time 16 years
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:56.780]  And I've had my reporters doing it and we're gonna be doing more of it
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:02.020]  And I think all of you should be going out doing man on the street for your own YouTube channel or online
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:04.660]  I mean, it's really to create a cultural
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:12.540]  Engagement with people about how dumbed-down folks have gotten Leanne McAdoo the stories up on prison planet TV
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:16.460]  She went out and could find no one that knew that dihydrogen monoxide was water
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.020]  I
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:20.180]  Redoing a pen and teller skit from like nine years ago
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.580]  We heard that yesterday
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:26.460]  That they picked up from a high school student who had done it a few years before that
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:29.860]  Showing his whole class including his so-called biology teacher
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:37.780]  Did not know what dihydrogen monoxide was and so we went out and did it and found no one in Austin in a wealthiest
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:39.620]  part of town
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:44.660]  Right on the pedestrian bridge with you know all these university professors and people
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:49.740]  None of them knew what dihydrogen monoxide was and they did call for banning it because it has a scary
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:53.180]  sounding name like carbon dioxide or sodium chloride or
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:57.340]  potassium chloride a table salt sodium chloride is
[02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:59.660]  potassium chloride a variant of it and
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:05.060]  That's why I want to air this mark dice piece because just mark when he's on just just does a tremendous job
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:09.020]  And it's good to see him. You know out there really
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:14.620]  Showing how dumbed-down people are he did another video where he's like did you hear we nuke China blew up
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:19.500]  Two other cities last week over the trade deficit and people are like oh, that's that's you know. That's a good idea
[02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:23.460]  Oh, I don't care or okay. Well whatever you know we might have wanted to talk to him
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:27.140]  I mean just totally disconnect. Oh millions are dead. Okay. I gotta go
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:30.620]  Look if you don't care about millions dying which didn't die
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:37.740]  And don't even know about something like that. Do you think you've got any future these are people in a zombie state?
[02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:45.260]  We're raised in their diapers in front of a television where they don't interact. It's a mental illness and the global
[02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:50.780]  Let's brag about this their brainwaves are very close to a sleep state you what you see them walk around you say
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:54.740]  It's like they're in a daze. They're in wine and when you go. Hey wake up
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.740]  They're like your five-year-old don't want to get out of bed
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:00.220]  I'll be waking my seven-year-old up or you know ten-year-old and hey get up
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:05.340]  You know we got to go to church or whatever. Let me sleep ten more minutes descending. I leave me alone. Let me alone
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:12.740]  We've got to wake these zombies up plus. It's more invigorating to be awake, and that is what's happened
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:14.740]  I mean it is a mass
[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:16.720]  Zombiosis so when they laugh at you
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:23.140]  That's a pre-programmed response because they've seen millions of simulated murders on TV death killing video games
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:25.340]  So you tell them about hey, you know
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:29.180]  Two million dead Chinese a nuclear attack, and they just go I don't care
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.940]  Because they
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:38.960]  They can't differentiate. What's real and this has been done scientifically the globalist brag about this
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:42.260]  Bernays bragged about it 60 70 years ago
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:49.700]  And and now they've got a giant horde of people who don't care if millions are dying in Iraq or whatever for real
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:53.020]  But then when the media shakes them out of it to go the dead children
[02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:56.380]  Here's their names, then they cry and call for our guns over 20 dead kids
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:00.740]  You know they're taken out of the trance occasionally, but only by the programmers
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:06.420]  So there's a split. There's people waking up. There's people that that are getting deeper into the trance and
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:10.420]  I'm gonna have my crew go out in Austin
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:13.940]  And I was already planning on it. I guess great minds think alike

[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:23.220]  I love the good work of people like Mark Deiss
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:29.020]  You know you even about individually you know particularly. I'm sad for people in there and their own personal stuff

[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:47.140]  I was just out there. They have CNN on the TV. Can you guys pump that in here for TV viewers radio listeners?
[02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:50.340]  Paul Begala, I meant to mention that weeks ago. He has his own
[02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:53.620]  TV show
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:25:00.780]  His own TV show and and notice all over CNN ABC you name it it's nothing, but former government people
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:03.900]  Because it's state-run media
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:10.460]  And he's the guy that said executive orders stroke of the pen law the land
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:16.980]  kind of cool an incredibly nasty person deeply involved in the black ops of the
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:23.700]  Clemson administration, I mean Anderson Cooper's admittedly CIA and we've got to sit up there with
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:29.500]  Classical brainwashing media, and you know I said I'd get into the heart of the New World Order. I've gotten to a lot of it
[02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:38.180]  But you got to understand. This is like medical triage when when when people get totally lazy totally decadent totally stupid
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:40.700]  totally disconnected from reality
[02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:45.380]  They're like lambs to the slaughter we have become domesticated
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:49.900]  It's like a dog you put in a box. It's all life. I just throw food in the jail cell window
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:52.180]  It knows and eat doesn't know anything about the outside world
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:55.980]  It is a victim and people sit in front of televisions their whole life
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:26:00.420]  They see their neighbors shot and killed they don't even care they saw that on the movies a thousand times
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:03.820]  And
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:05.820]  the fact that
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:08.340]  We went out in Austin with a petition and
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:11.540]  Everyone signed it to ban water
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:17.260]  Everyone one guy came up. We were leaving people said well. Why did you get him because we were leaving and so wait?
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:22.660]  That was dihydrogen mon, dihydrogen monoxide. That's water isn't it a guy we talked to I?
[02:26:23.660 --> 02:26:25.660]  Mean that is crazy
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:29.620]  Number one you'd say what is it and she kept saying well? It's it's water basically
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:34.380]  You know it's it's what you wash your stuff with I mean they didn't get it. She's like laughing at them
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:38.140]  They're on the bridge with the Colorado River under them
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:41.860]  And and and they even call the Colorado River Lady Bird Lake
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:48.300]  See it's this false reality. Let's just name a stretch of the river off of the former first lady and call it a lake
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:52.260]  You're like. What's the big thing there? It's that everything is a stinking lie now
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:56.460]  It is an ocean of lies. It is an overthrow of reality
[02:26:56.460 --> 02:27:01.940]  That's what the new March magazine that everybody should subscribe to big color magazine to wake people up
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:06.940]  Buy them in bulk ten up to a hundred. It's probably gonna sell out again, so get them give them to people and it shows
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:11.420]  All the government lies and hoaxes and the people that are even away go well. That's just what they do they lie
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:15.460]  Yeah, they're licking their chops down to take your pension funds
[02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:22.380]  I mean they're going to take everything America had all this wealth because people would kill you if you tried to push them around
[02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:27.860]  America's had all its problems and boy do they get advertised but compared to the United States
[02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:32.420]  America's had all its problems and boy do they get advertised but compared to any other country
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:36.100]  We made more science more inventions more patents more wealth
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:40.520]  He got in a war with us everybody feared us before we even had high-tech weapons
[02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:44.420]  Because we were real we came here through adversity
[02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:51.560]  I don't care what color you are you came here through adversity and now the globalist the social engineers know what Victor Hugo said is true
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:59.400]  Adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters, and I go look at the young people they are monsters
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:03.480]  Unhealthy monsters, I mean I have a stack of articles here
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:09.500]  And I'm gonna do a whole special report on on what the New World Order master plan is
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:14.400]  Where people can't talk now the IQs are dropping
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.920]  The language is shrinking people are getting early onset of Alzheimer's
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:20.960]  It's all
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.120]  happening
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:26.000]  You know I've been behind the scenes on man cows TV show. That's now number one in Chicago
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:32.480]  Samuel cast with his radio show and he's even saying to his crew. He's like get off the smartphones
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:37.220]  We're going live in two minutes everybody wake up wake up wake up come on. Let's wake up
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:41.780]  Let's wake up, and I've been in other companies and businesses where they go out. We're gonna in lunch
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.200]  Let's keep those smartphones off unless it's work. Let's everybody wake up
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:51.360]  That's what they say about all the top companies that are left the person running it knows everybody's in a trance. It's like hey
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:54.640]  Wake up come on wake up wake up

[02:33:21.580 --> 02:33:28.860]  Well, thank the good lord above that dr. Steve Vachinik got safely back from the DMZ we have unprecedented fear mongering going on
[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:33.320]  With North Korea saying we'll nuke Tokyo. We're loading the warheads
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:38.120]  I mean this is insane and and I don't have a theory I have facts
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:42.560]  But the best evidence points towards criminal elements in the anglo-american
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:47.580]  Dutch the Imperium in the great game actually
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:54.280]  Telling Kim Jong-un to do this as a promise for oil and and
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:34:01.400]  Food so they can sell weapons if the clinic hinted at this, but when he was in the country seemed a little concerned about it
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:05.560]  Until he got back, so we'll find out what he thinks in a moment, and I'll recap that
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:07.560]  But
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:10.120]  First off I wanted to get to this before we forgot
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:16.900]  How the Pentagon used video games to spy on users worldwide democracy now they brag
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:23.500]  That they're watching you over connect and Xbox and all this it's like the last Starfighter that actually
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.440]  recruited people to fly drones off of their scores
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:33.800]  but this was to then track people and and to have it designed for Muslims to pick it up and
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:36.040]  Track everything they're doing
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:44.320]  Pretty amazing that they did this with native echo and so just be aware of that here's another one
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:50.040]  Hackers use Android remotely attack and hijack an airplane and that's out of a computer world
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:54.640]  And again, this is just two articles today
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:34:59.200]  There's another one zero hedge
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:05.080]  Carmen Reinhardt no doubt our pensions are screwed being announced everywhere here and in Europe. They're gonna the pensions are already gone
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:09.760]  I mean, that's why they want your bullets and your guns folks. They know you're gonna be mad
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:15.120]  So they're gonna take the vets pensions too, and they've done actuaries knowing a lot of them are gonna
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:18.680]  Go haywire over it a lot of cops in military gonna get killed
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:19.960]  They're gonna have a civil war instead
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:25.680]  Let's just all come together take the states back triage and write off the derivatives arrest the globalist restore the Republic
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:29.080]  But we're going to talk about a picnic here in a moment
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:34.020]  This is a little three-minute report that a Leanne McAdoo put together with Facebook's new
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:40.560]  Home system that ties into all the internet spying. I was just talking about where he calls you dumb efforts
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:43.680]  He goes my customers think that they can trust me
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:48.600]  You're a bunch of dumb efforts and laughs at you and then does goes to Bilderberg and then does a pump-and-dump
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:50.840]  total scam
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:56.560]  With the Facebook stock and he doesn't go to jail because he's in the untouchable club the white shoe boys to use
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.720]  the East Coast parlance and
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:03.000]  We'll see how untouchable they are
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:03.700]  I mean
[02:36:03.700 --> 02:36:08.960]  They think homeland security this new fifth branch the military is gonna protect him this first branch of tyranny
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.640]  That is it rhetoric by the way. That's what it is. Let's go to this report then to dr. Pachannik
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:18.520]  I'd give us his take what he can really tell us now that he got back being cased by the CIA and others
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:20.920]  But here is Leanne McAdoo
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:27.320]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and this is an info wars news bulletin
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:33.400]  Facebook will launch its latest data mining device with the release of Facebook home on April 12th
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:42.040]  The company's new move into the lucrative mobile advertising market comes on the heels of last year's pump-and-dump scandal which cost investors billions
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:49.000]  The mobile app will first be available to Android users and according to the site from the moment you wake your phone
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  You'll be immersed in cover feed
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:58.200]  Before if you wanted to be inundated with the vacuous status updates of your friends and pictures of their half-eaten breakfast
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:00.960]  You had to manually launch the Facebook app
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:04.600]  Well, no more behold the future
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:12.000]  By replacing the unlock and home screen of your phone the company that's determined to creep into every area of your life
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:19.200]  Can now flood your phone with pictures chat requests and suggestions without even needing to be unlocked
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:27.240]  With Facebook home, you're basically authorizing the complete surrender of your privacy much like its web-based counterpart
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:34.360]  That is no stranger to privacy encroachment home will collect information like your location how you connect with friends
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:39.080]  What sort of apps you interact with and your internet searches in order to?
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.800]  Personalize the advertising that will be seizure handheld device while it's awake
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:51.960]  As we've reported before Facebook is regularly used by the IRS to scan your account and Twitter feed while conducting audits
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.760]  Now if you launch an app via Facebook home
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:02.140]  Information about your purchases could be stored and subject to subpoena much like all the other information Facebook collects on you
[02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:10.080]  law enforcement officials also scour social networks using facial recognition software and have arrested people like this
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:15.420]  20-year-old for posting a picture of graffiti to her Facebook owned Instagram account
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:20.420]  even something as innocent as liking a religious or political page or
[02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:24.300]  Attending a rally is collected and can be used against you
[02:38:25.220 --> 02:38:29.500]  Why then would anyone want to be smartphone shackled to a social network?
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:36.900]  That's known for mining and collecting data and then providing that information to advertisers and other nefarious systems
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:45.700]  basically the app signals Facebook's ideal to have you chronically connected to the Facebook interface so it can be the sole data house of
[02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:47.420]  citizen intelligence
[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:52.540]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that home is built around people not apps
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:58.620]  Which means that users can spend more time interacting with their friends and families on their smartphones
[02:38:58.620 --> 02:39:05.780]  Well if by family he means keeping you perpetually connected to big brother big sis and DARPA
[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:10.520]  Well kudos to you Zuckerberg. Maybe you were right about your Facebook users
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:18.460]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and this has been an info Wars news bulletin and
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:24.460]  For radio listeners during the pause we show the headline where he publicly said you're a bunch of dumb efforts
[02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:32.020]  I mean, and that's the thing they're laughing at you. They pump and dump you it Facebook in the CIA was a book of
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.500]  enemies faces
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:39.260]  Even the name. It's just all a giant sick joke you say well. Why are you on Facebook?
[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:46.360]  Well, I mean why a lot of special forces parachute behind enemy lines. I mean I mean we're there to engage us where the fight
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:51.340]  Is why are we on YouTube the big DARPA run system because we're here to bring war against tyranny
[02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:56.800]  Okay, they're waging war on us. We're waging in full war on them and just open up in all directions
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:02.520]  Don't overthink your attacks. Just attack in all directions. We will bring them down by force of mass I
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:09.640]  Mean their own minions are zombies folks brainwaves are lowered IQs dropping under chemical binary attack
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:13.480]  All we've got to do is energize plug into our hardwired
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.800]  Instinctive drives that we have enemies running things, and we'll take everything over
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.160]  They need you focused on them feeling guilty about yourself for I'm not gonna get into the psychology of it
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:27.340]  Let's go to dr. Steve pochenik joining us back in the u.s.
[02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:32.980]  He bravely flew over there unannounced and went up to the DMZ former a top hostage negotiator and
[02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:41.020]  Crisis manager for the State Department and combat veteran in classified operations before that helped found the Delta Force with General Boykin
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:45.580]  Most of you know who he is very interesting guys helped overthrow governments with psi ops
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:48.560]  I mean you name it and he joins us
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.520]  Here's what I wanted to cover with you just out of the gate search the quick answer on this you said it's all a false
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:41:00.600]  Flag between China the US North Korea and others, but you know to sell weapons and that North Korea wants oil and food
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:04.480]  But and it's not a black box obviously since you talked to us it turns out
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:08.040]  There were secret meetings put that up on screen guys Reuters with the Pentagon
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:12.180]  Kim Jong-un a month ago before all this started
[02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:17.980]  And I have Rumsfeld a mainstream news articles from 15 years ago up on in full wars calm
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:25.060]  Who gave North Korea the nukes in the first place US government the CIA China's massing troops on the border with North Korea?
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:31.340]  Threatening them like they never had before is North Korea almost out of China's control. Have they done a flip-flop
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:37.860]  You know like stalling away from Hitler or as Hitler cheated him first with their deal in Poland
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:44.320]  Is Kim Jong-un actually being manipulated or will he be double-crossed now threatening to nuke?
[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:51.440]  Tokyo I mean am am I wrong sir in saying this is unprecedented dr. Steve pochenik joining us
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:57.700]  Alex first of all let me congratulate you I came here to San Francisco and believe it or not
[02:41:57.700 --> 02:42:02.420]  I was at Berkeley last night, and you are a hero in a left-wing organization
[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:09.060]  Called Berkeley University, so you have really reached that across the spectrum Alex
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:10.100]  I'm very proud of you
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:16.860]  Let me get right out to the point number one Kim Jong-un is not relevant the entire issue here is has to do with
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:19.820]  Dynamics it has to do with dynamics the United States Japan
[02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:23.360]  China Russia and Southeast Asia
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:29.700]  Kim Jong-un is not out of control not at all all he is doing is expressing the
[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:36.380]  The dynamic of trying to get more food more oil and more subsistence from the United States
[02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:42.140]  Japan and other countries because this is a weak nation. It's a nation. That's falling apart
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:45.540]  It's what we call a failed state for the most part
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:51.420]  We've kept that nation alive so that we wouldn't implode north to South Korea because it was too poor
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:55.460]  But in reality we're keeping it there to justify the use of our
[02:42:55.460 --> 02:43:02.180]  Our naval fleet in South China Sea and it is used to use a lot of our military
[02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:04.580]  equipment as a
[02:43:04.580 --> 02:43:11.820]  Test ground for the Navy the Marine and the Air Force the reality is that Kim Jong-un is not even relevant
[02:43:11.820 --> 02:43:19.420]  He's really just following directions according to his hand his uncle and the China handler from China as well as the
[02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:26.420]  Understanding that he has had with the CIA the DIA the DNI because he's lived 13 years in Switzerland
[02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:29.980]  So, you know all of our intelligence operatives know him very very well
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:34.980]  All he's done now is to really just bluster a lot of words
[02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:42.160]  There is no nuclear missiles that can do anything whatsoever the South Koreans when I left we're mocking America
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:47.460]  They thought we were absolutely so is that report leaked on purpose because I understand they do have some atomic
[02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:52.780]  Devices and some smaller missiles that might be able to deliver them to see all or Japan now
[02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:54.940]  But you're saying that's even baloney. That's baloney
[02:43:55.460 --> 02:44:01.700]  Basically every country has atomic devices correct. Let me put it this was Pakistan has a hundred and seven
[02:44:02.140 --> 02:44:08.940]  tactical nuclear weapons that we developed between the CIA the ISI and Mr. Khan in order to create a
[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:13.340]  Strategic tension force and you've never seen Pakistan use it instead
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:20.140]  We talked about Iran sure and then our media acts like it was an accident and there's no capacity to hit anything whatsoever
[02:44:20.140 --> 02:44:27.420]  But we make it you use it as an excuse to deploy our troops into South China Sea to deploy them into Australia
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:29.780]  you remember the meeting between
[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:36.260]  Obama and Hillary and Minamor during the time that we were in Syria and I said to myself this was very unusual
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:41.740]  So what if this was all pre-planned as a way of not necessarily having a false flag
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:47.340]  but having a point of strategic tension so that the president once again could
[02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:52.180]  Incompetently handle or not handle a situation that would put him in the history books
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:59.500]  Remember a president the United States can do nothing domestically. He was already damaged our economy and Obamacare, but now
[02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:05.600]  Internationally he can he has created another situation. It's more narcissism. We're all I see
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:11.600]  Nuclear missiles in this one. It will not be effective. So yeah, I mean I turn on CNN all it is is former Clinton
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:14.720]  And Obama people now with their own TV shows. This is just mad
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:18.440]  Narcissism. Well, it's beyond mad narcissism
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:22.480]  What it is is it's out of control what it is is really criminal behavior
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:29.520]  And really this is where the American public your public the entire public the Berkeley public has to say cease and desist
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:34.300]  Because what do we were in fact doing is I came back here in San Francisco
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:38.680]  I see more homeless people. I see more the beggars
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:44.600]  I see poor infrastructure that mirrors more like North Korea and it does South Korea in some ways
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:50.080]  I feel when I come to San Francisco and downtown when I see all these bums were supported and
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:54.440]  Under oh, it's rotting America is rotting great liberals
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.520]  I feel I'm more in North Korea than I am in South Korea where there's wealth
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:04.600]  All right, there's there's control and there's prosperity. So we've become very much like North Korea
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:10.760]  We're mimicking the North Korean reaction and we're mimicking a North Korean economy, which is going down exactly
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.920]  militarily controlled and no financial capacity to grow for
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:22.920]  Manufacturing the way South Korea can so the irony is we're becoming more and more like North Korea and less like South Korea
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:26.900]  All right. Let me stop you. You've said Rumsfeld's really bad news. He seems to come in
[02:46:26.900 --> 02:46:33.760]  It's criminal. Well, it's not just bad news. I've known Rumsfeld since he was a secretary of defense under Nixon
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  No one liked him. He was a dangerous man. Then he had a very little understanding of strategic and then a tactical war
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  He was a very well look at what he did with Iraq, but let's just stop right there
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.720]  Let me just bring this up to you here
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:50.260]  And I want to ask you what's changed because neo cons were still defending Iraq just a few years ago now
[02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:54.520]  They admit it was a disaster. But but let me raise this we have the article at info wars calm
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:47:01.040]  Who gave North Korea the news in the first place and it links to BBC AP Reuters from 15 years ago and 10 years ago?
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.520]  when Clinton and
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:05.680]  others and the UN
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:13.800]  transferred reactors in North Korea that are perfect for making atomic, you know, the enriched uranium for atomic bombs, why
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:20.940]  Would the West want to give that hermit empire the ability to make atomic bombs?
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:23.520]  And then here we are
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:28.960]  Being told we got to have TSA do proctology exams on our wife because bin Laden might be up there
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:34.400]  But at the same time that the globalists have given atomic weapons to these morons
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:36.820]  Well, it's a very good question Alex
[02:47:36.820 --> 02:47:42.760]  I was part indirectly of that of a beating on that and I was against it the reason that was done because
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:47.080]  Blinton Clinton again Bill Clinton and Hillary are not very competent
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:54.360]  Most of our leaders aren't it was a in an attempt to appease the North Korean by giving them a concessionary
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:03.660]  point where we would control some form of nuclear reactor which was under our control and it was in a
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:05.920]  sequestered
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.580]  Package so honestly we did give them a controlled
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.960]  quasi private public
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:19.400]  Underwritten a nuclear capacity to keep them quiet, but truthfully it was incompetence writ large
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:27.080]  We are completely incompetent in the way. We handle foreign affairs and domestic affairs. What's happening is again
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:32.260]  We've gone in towards an Iraq Afghanistan Syria, and now we are basically
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.680]  Competently handling. Why are they putting out reports? I mean it looks like they did it on purpose
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:41.080]  Oh, we didn't mean to leak that. Oh, it's it's quasi secret
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:42.160]  I
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:48.720]  To say that they've got weapons and can deliver them. They know they have no weapons to deliver it
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:51.080]  Let me give you the following why did they leave that man?
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:58.600]  I a man who's totally incompetent next Air Force general James Clapper who have no idea what he does was put in there by
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:02.580]  Feinstein a whole group after 9-11 is head of the director of national intelligence
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:08.280]  Which means absolutely nothing another confusing aspect then you have the head of the CIA
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:15.640]  John Brennan who we know is totally incompetent and created a lot of the false flag then we have on top of that the head
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:23.920]  Of DIA Defense Intelligence Agency Mike Flynn a general who really doesn't know anything then above that you have the National
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:30.200]  Geostation agency another intelligence organization that know nothing now you put together five different military
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:36.120]  Intelligence organization with one civilian put together a White House with incompetent little
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:40.160]  Neo fights and children and you get groupthink of ignorance
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:44.440]  And then they come out with an analysis that has no relevance to the real world
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:50.760]  And then you go to Seoul Korea and everybody's laughing at you you go to Japan everybody's laughing exactly
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:55.240]  So let me expand on this then because we've seen this with Hitler going east we see this with Nero
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:59.760]  We see this happen where they go crazy in their own echo chambers now
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:04.440]  They're admittedly getting caught in lies everywhere correct their plans to try a domestic takeover
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:10.800]  That's not gonna work. I mean I agree with you because I'm not normally it's an incompetence deal. It's a tyranny deal
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.160]  They think they're in control. They're not which even makes them more dangerous. That's correct
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:20.780]  What's happening is the more and more you think you're in control and the greater the?
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:25.980]  Complexity of the system in the United States as we add more and more intelligence services
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:31.880]  Which have no idea of what they're doing and it's costing us a fortune when you have eight hundred thousand
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:35.960]  contractors with top secret secret top secret
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:45.200]  And I see CIA operatives in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and special forces and Rangers who have no idea what this
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:48.360]  Strategy is no idea the rules of engagement
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:55.040]  They're just wandering around acting powerful because they've all been programmed by the TV designed to neutralize the public instead
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:51:00.240]  It's neutralized them. Oh my god. We'll be right back. It's zombie apocalypse stay with us
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:07.760]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as?

[02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:24.000]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function the number one method by which your body
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:28.920]  Detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione the number one superfood that helps turn on all

[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:27.940]  Let's show this document here to TV viewers the decline of average human. I cube
[02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:34.600]  It's plunging very very quickly right now a lot of that's chemical
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:37.500]  But also people aren't ever challenging their brains TV
[02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:40.300]  More and more people are in like a trance
[02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:45.220]  I mean you can go out to man on the street and say hey we knew China two weeks ago and killed 10 million people
[02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:49.060]  Do you think that's a problem people go? No? It's not a problem. There's an actual man on the street
[02:55:49.060 --> 02:55:52.620]  We have posted info wars calm remark dice went out
[02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:58.240]  They said that I mean either people are more awake, or they're not and and and what do you call this?
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:04.100]  You're a top psychiatrist not a quacker. You know the real deal. What is happening societally? What do you call it because?
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:07.860]  I've been to high security events, and I've watched Secret Service
[02:56:08.260 --> 02:56:14.120]  Special Forces as well they tend to be more focused and have eye contact and and and seem to be not on a power trip
[02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:16.180]  But you know when somebody's in a narcissistic
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:21.620]  Talking into their sleeve feeling like when a kid thinks they're Superman in a costume and strutting around
[02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:23.900]  I see that in the leaders as well
[02:56:24.220 --> 02:56:29.040]  I mean, it's it's it's really sad and it's like Nero or something
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:33.460]  What do you call that and where is it going and where do you see North Korea ending up in this latest total?
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:39.980]  sociopathy and criminal behavior ever since Clinton Bush jr. Should have been tried for criminal activity and
[02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:46.580]  Prosecute it and Obama should be prosecuted for criminal activity as well, and hopefully we could stop this
[02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:52.060]  But this is where the American public has to decide are they going to continue with this kind of a republic of sociopathy?
[02:56:52.780 --> 02:56:55.140]  Are they going to change it forcibly or?
[02:56:57.460 --> 02:57:03.020]  If we don't change it how bad will it get what how bad will it get if it keeps going down this course?
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:04.860]  It will get very bad
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:10.900]  We will end up to be and we are ending up to be a third world country with basically a republic
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:14.540]  That's dysfunctional like North Korea, but an empire. That's like Rome
[02:57:15.140 --> 02:57:19.660]  An imperial empire which will not function very well our military is totally
[02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:25.340]  Dissociated from our civilian and our manufacturing capacity is totally geared the military
[02:57:25.460 --> 02:57:31.980]  We have failed very miserably at leadership domestically and failed miserably in international leadership
[02:57:31.980 --> 02:57:39.260]  So we have really violated our the precepts of our founding fathers, and we are in serious serious trouble
[02:57:39.260 --> 02:57:43.780]  Why did you get out so quick you said you were being followed quite a bit and see I got out quickly
[02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:49.900]  Because I'd gotten into Korea. I got into North Korea and basically what happened is after a while
[02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:51.900]  It was getting to be very quickly
[02:57:52.580 --> 02:57:54.580]  consumed by CIA

[03:00:05.660 --> 03:00:07.340]  Big brother
[03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:09.040]  mainstream media
[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:11.540]  Government cover-ups you want answers
[03:00:12.060 --> 03:00:20.100]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:22.100]  Texas Alex Jones
[03:00:22.100 --> 03:00:30.380]  Wow dr. Steve Wojciech, former top hostage and crisis negotiator for the State Department worked in black ops across the board with the military
[03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:34.980]  You were just saying you got into North Korea
[03:00:35.380 --> 03:00:39.620]  Tell us about that because I know we were calling your hotel right there
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:41.900]  You know close to the DMZ born in the United States
[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:46.020]  And I have another passport which allows me to get into this country in and out
[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:52.260]  I was able to see certain aspects of the industrial complex some of their military and
[03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:59.020]  Quite frankly, they're not out of control. There's nothing crazy about them. They seem to be very much in control
[03:00:59.180 --> 03:01:04.780]  It's a highly controlled society as you would expect the third world nation. That was very much like
[03:01:06.100 --> 03:01:09.900]  Communists does a Romania or Bulgaria 30 40 years ago
[03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:16.900]  But what you hear is that they don't take themselves all that seriously and really what's happening is that at the senior level?
[03:01:17.380 --> 03:01:19.380]  you're getting this kind of
[03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:25.460]  warmongering in order to force the United States and China and England to go or
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:28.540]  Japan to come to the table in order to give
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:31.740]  Korea a chance to have some food
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:38.620]  Subsistence and money but truthfully Korea North Korea is not as bad as everybody thinks number one
[03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:43.620]  They're exporting bauxite number two. They're exporting minerals and other products
[03:01:43.620 --> 03:01:50.260]  They're doing exceedingly better than most people would realize now you were involved with with North Korea some when you were in the State Department
[03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:57.100]  And those with his father Kim Jong-il and then Kim Il-sung Kim Jong-il was quite a smart man
[03:01:57.100 --> 03:02:02.260]  He was very much like what I was doing at that time. He was an executive producer television shows
[03:02:02.260 --> 03:02:04.260]  He was very creative very funny
[03:02:04.260 --> 03:02:11.020]  But our intelligence system in the State Department and elsewhere insisted on calling him a crazy man wearing high heels
[03:02:11.460 --> 03:02:18.100]  When in fact he was a very smart man running 2.2 million people in Korea in the military with antiquated
[03:02:18.540 --> 03:02:23.620]  equipment antiquated Soviet military and no military is going to cross over the DMZ line
[03:02:23.660 --> 03:02:27.580]  They don't have you're talking about the grandfather. They don't have the food
[03:02:27.980 --> 03:02:32.700]  So it's not going to happen what happened in effect is a dramatic situation
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:34.660]  which should never have happened because of our
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:41.460]  intelligence if we had any that should have been prevented kept at a very low key level and instead we mirror imaged it and
[03:02:41.860 --> 03:02:47.580]  Precipitated it through the incompetence of our president in confidence and use but they're doing it for a false flag
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:49.100]  They don't think they're incompetent
[03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:55.760]  But I mean you're saying it could lead to something that would cause Korea to implode into both China and South Korea
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:57.980]  The Chinese are taking it very seriously
[03:02:57.980 --> 03:03:05.620]  Yes, because the greatest that the greatest deficit in all of this the greatest problem will not be really for South Korea
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:11.580]  South Korea can maintain it with the Republic of Korean Army and also the fact that they're very wealthy
[03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:14.460]  What cannot take it and is not capable of?
[03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:17.060]  handling economically is
[03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:20.300]  Li Jiepong the new technocrat
[03:03:20.300 --> 03:03:21.940]  He's not a good leader of China
[03:03:21.940 --> 03:03:28.220]  The Chinese cannot handle the North Koreans coming over the border in massive amounts of their 22 million
[03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:35.900]  Because the Chinese now have an economic problem. They have a food problem. They have a water problem now, and they have a financial problem
[03:03:35.900 --> 03:03:37.900]  They cannot handle a
[03:03:38.060 --> 03:03:39.060]  swath of
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:39.900]  22 million
[03:03:39.900 --> 03:03:45.740]  Well, here's my final question then border as if they came over the border from Mexico into Arizona
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:52.460]  They cannot handle that. It's far more of a danger to China than it is to South Korea or anybody else. It has no
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:56.060]  We've only got one minute left on hand. We only got one minute left
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:04:00.020]  How do you expect all this to end because it looks like it's just escalator
[03:04:00.060 --> 03:04:04.140]  We come to a negotiated settlement and we'll do an appeasement once again
[03:04:04.340 --> 03:04:09.300]  Carrie who's not a very effective Secretary of State will sit down. We'll give them some money
[03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:11.820]  We'll give them some food and once again
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:18.180]  There'll be some kind of appeasement and it will continue South Korea will grow
[03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:25.000]  China will fall apart North Korea will actually ironically grow in many ways if they'll open up the Jisung
[03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:27.660]  industrial complex and more and more
[03:04:28.380 --> 03:04:32.140]  54,000 of the North Koreans will continue to work and they will get more
[03:04:32.260 --> 03:04:39.420]  Currency and eventually within five to ten years North Korea will be integrated what's called on a soft landing with South Korea
[03:04:39.420 --> 03:04:46.420]  Hopefully we will get rid of our intelligence our military and a lot of our incompetent leaders and our incompetent military
[03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:52.920]  Or instead Homeland Security will try to just conquer America because that's what it's doing. We're the real country. They're trying to conquer
[03:04:52.920 --> 03:05:08.600]  Dr. Pachinik, StevePachinik.com. Thank you for all the time. I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central live
