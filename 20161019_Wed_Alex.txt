[00:00.000 --> 00:24.400]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.400 --> 00:30.400]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.400 --> 00:58.640]  technocracy tank-over. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.520]  As Americans turn the corner towards the final presidential debate on Wednesday, the
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.840]  election circus has devolved into personal attacks and character assassination rather
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.320]  than any real focus on the issues plaguing the United States.
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.880]  The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even
[01:18.880 --> 01:27.840]  a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears.
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.280]  Using an avalanche of new accusations from women who are coming forward to claim he
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.480]  kissed and fondled them. Six women are going public today with stories that echo what Trump
[01:38.480 --> 01:42.040]  himself said in that notorious Hot Mike video.
[01:42.040 --> 01:47.360]  He called this woman Ms. Piggy. Her name is Alicia Machado.
[01:47.360 --> 01:50.120]  Trump spoke out about those claims on Fox News.
[01:50.120 --> 01:55.280]  And she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. And she gained a massive
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.320]  amount of weight. And it was real problems.
[01:59.320 --> 02:05.040]  Regardless of the fact that Obama's unconstitutional open border policy is quietly responsible
[02:05.040 --> 02:11.000]  for killing as many as 7,500 Americans every year, 20 on average per day due to the hordes
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.760]  of illegal drivers flooding the roads while Obama creates a pilot program to have Americans
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.680]  pay for Syrian refugees to come to the United States and move into our homes.
[02:22.680 --> 02:30.120]  Regardless of the fact that food stamp participation has increased by 78% over the past 10 years.
[02:30.120 --> 02:35.300]  Regardless of the fact that Obama and Hillary's new Cold War rhetoric amplified by a suicidal
[02:35.300 --> 02:41.540]  mainstream media has obliterated any shred of integrity 6% of Americans still think cable
[02:41.540 --> 02:47.440]  fed propaganda media has after polls revealed America is almost completely done with the
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.460]  mainstream media mainstream media's stranglehold of propaganda desperation and damage was palpable
[02:53.460 --> 02:59.640]  on the campaign trail as if its demise was what truly concerns Americans but obviously
[02:59.640 --> 03:02.440]  has panicked the ruling elite.
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.280]  He doesn't have the temperament. He doesn't have the knowledge. He doesn't seem to have
[03:06.280 --> 03:13.960]  the interest in acquiring the knowledge or the basic honesty that a president needs to
[03:13.960 --> 03:22.320]  have. And that was true before we heard him talking about how he treats women.
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.960]  This is not something that we can ignore. It's not something we can just sweep under
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.760]  the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season.
[03:31.760 --> 03:34.240]  By the way, Len Beck's supporting the statements here by the way.
[03:34.240 --> 03:38.560]  Because this was not just a lewd conversation. This wasn't just locker room banter.
[03:38.560 --> 03:47.080]  This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior.
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  She cares so much.
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.600]  And actually bragging about kissing and groping women using language so seen that many of
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.200]  us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.
[03:57.200 --> 03:58.200]  She cares so much.
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.520]  She made a powerful speech. They said it was the greatest speech of the decade I think.
[04:02.520 --> 04:06.400]  Speaking to everyone out there who respects women and saying put your politics aside for
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.120]  a second and be able to cause something that's indefensible and defends your nationality.
[04:10.120 --> 04:12.000]  And you care less about women when they're killed and enslaved.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.680]  Your politics aside for a second.
[04:13.680 --> 04:14.680]  I say nothing about China.
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.680]  There's nothing about the future.
[04:15.680 --> 04:17.840]  And Washington DC knows it.
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.880]  Six in ten Americans are getting their news from social media alone.
[04:22.880 --> 04:28.880]  While one in five households has dropped cable's buffet of news propaganda to research digital
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.320]  options and think for themselves.
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.160]  Mainstream media with its hubris is shallow and obvious as the corporate government criminals
[04:36.160 --> 04:40.440]  it represents appears to be breathing its last gasp.
[04:40.440 --> 04:46.440]  John bound for infowars.com absolutely and here is the bottom line even if Trump doesn't
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.320]  get elected which I think he will they may try to steal it.
[04:50.320 --> 04:51.320]  This is his victory.
[04:51.320 --> 04:55.520]  We're exposing their whole criminal operation is really a referendum on mainstream media
[04:55.520 --> 04:59.400]  and they've totally shown their hand and destroyed themselves and the ratings show that they're
[04:59.400 --> 05:00.400]  over.
[05:00.400 --> 05:05.920]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com sing video paid Hillary operatives inciting violence
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.120]  at Trump rallies article up by Kit Daniels a video released by Project Veritas reveals
[05:11.120 --> 05:17.000]  the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC are involved in this tactic called bird doggy
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.480]  and rely on a network of democratic consultants to oversee the operation and to give Hillary
[05:22.480 --> 05:26.480]  plausible deniability if the tactic is exposed.
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.400]  In turn the consultants are working with democratic super PACs and other groups to give maximum
[05:31.400 --> 05:37.080]  media exposure to the bird dogging violence which they admit targets the elderly and disable
[05:37.080 --> 05:43.480]  for maximum shock value and an email released by WikiLeaks shows that at least one bird
[05:43.480 --> 05:48.480]  dogging operation was approved directly by Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robbie
