[00:00.000 --> 00:06.800]  Reuters is reporting military activity by the United States and NATO exceeds that of
[00:06.800 --> 00:08.400]  any time during the Cold War.
[00:08.400 --> 00:09.400]  We're live.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.400]  It's a Sunday broadcast.
[00:10.400 --> 00:13.640]  When we come back in the next segment, I'm going to kick off one of the most important
[00:13.640 --> 00:15.600]  transmissions in my 22-year history.
[00:15.600 --> 00:16.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16.600 --> 00:18.400]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:18.400 --> 00:19.400]  Infowars.com's the website.
[00:19.400 --> 00:20.400]  Spread that link.
[00:20.400 --> 00:21.400]  You are fake news.
[00:21.400 --> 00:27.480]  Sir, can you CNN and its co-conspirators have backed themselves into a corner?
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.360]  I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[00:29.360 --> 00:30.360]  Doesn't that under...
[00:30.360 --> 00:31.360]  Very fake news.
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.560]  I know, but aren't you...
[00:33.560 --> 00:40.160]  In the court of public opinion, the entire sycophantic, abominized media has decided to continue to
[00:40.160 --> 00:45.760]  lie in the filthy bed they made for themselves after they cozied up to the ever-so-charming
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.160]  Constitution subverting former President Barack Obama.
[00:50.160 --> 00:55.040]  With a 35% approval rating, according to Quinnipiac, that's lower than Obama's worst
[00:55.040 --> 00:56.040]  approval rating.
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.320]  I'm sick and tired of this White House, as I was sick and tired of the campaign.
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.360]  I am tired of difference being disrespected and mistreated by this White House.
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.800]  There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team was spied on illegally.
[01:10.800 --> 01:13.960]  There is no evidence that backs up the president's original claim.
[01:13.960 --> 01:18.640]  And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise,
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.280]  nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people,
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.520]  by creating a diversion.
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.800]  Newsflash to all those overpaid anchors living in their plastic bubble.
[01:29.800 --> 01:36.240]  A vast majority of Americans have truly had enough of the blatant disinformation.
[01:36.240 --> 01:37.240]  It's different for the media.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.400]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.360]  Just today, the FBI comes out and says that 30%, 30% of their domestic terrorism cases
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.640]  that they're investigating are from folks who are refugees.
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.240]  It's important not to label all refugees bad people.
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.520]  That's not why I'm here, but do you f**k up?
[01:56.520 --> 02:00.200]  I was just going to say, Congressman, it's time to go, but I think the TV gremlins did
[02:00.200 --> 02:01.200]  that for us.
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.840]  Look, I want to see an honest press, but I started off today by saying that it's so important
[02:06.840 --> 02:09.120]  to the public to get an honest press.
[02:09.120 --> 02:11.760]  The public doesn't believe you people anymore.
[02:11.760 --> 02:17.680]  He could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what
[02:17.680 --> 02:18.680]  people think.
[02:18.680 --> 02:20.640]  And that is the, that is our job.
[02:20.640 --> 02:24.680]  You know, basically they, they're defaming her without any reason to do so because she's
[02:24.680 --> 02:26.800]  a woman, maybe because she's a black woman.
[02:26.800 --> 02:33.560]  I need Hillary to stand up right now and walk in and sue the United States of America.
[02:33.560 --> 02:39.440]  Was this an isolated incident or how about these bizarre green screen mishaps?
[02:39.440 --> 02:42.800]  Something is happening here and we're watching, we're standing in the skies for something
[02:42.800 --> 02:43.800]  else.
[02:43.800 --> 02:49.120]  Fast forward to the 2016 WikiLeaks release of flagrant collusion between the media
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.240]  Renfields and their power mad vampiric masters.
[02:53.240 --> 02:58.280]  Did this rude awakening push the leftist mob back towards an ethical center?
[02:58.280 --> 02:59.280]  Of course not.
[02:59.280 --> 03:01.600]  They tried to hack us and they failed.
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.000]  The DNC did not do that.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.400]  And if they did it, they could not have been hacked, but they were hacked and terrible things
[03:09.400 --> 03:10.400]  came in.
[03:10.400 --> 03:13.440]  And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so, they
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.160]  were, when I heard some of those things, I picked up the papers the next morning and
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.400]  so this is going to be front page, wasn't even in the papers.
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.960]  Next on the agenda was the rollout of fake town halls.
[03:25.960 --> 03:34.120]  Republican politicians facing fiery back lashes at Republican town halls from Utah to Tennessee.
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.680]  We will probably be implanted with chips.
[03:38.680 --> 03:44.280]  CNN and the rest of the Legion of Doom do not speak to the American people anymore.
[03:44.280 --> 03:48.880]  President Barack Obama, the first African American president, apologized for slavery.
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.880]  They're speaking directly to themselves and talking down to the rest of us like we are
[03:53.880 --> 03:54.880]  children.
[03:54.880 --> 03:57.760]  Their message is peace and coming together in the country.
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.760]  What's your message?
[03:59.760 --> 04:01.720]  You don't believe that for one minute, do you?
[04:01.720 --> 04:02.720]  That their message is?
[04:02.720 --> 04:03.720]  Yeah.
[04:03.720 --> 04:04.920]  That's what they said to me.
[04:04.920 --> 04:05.920]  Okay.
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.920]  Yeah, believe them.
[04:06.920 --> 04:09.680]  Any protests over the deaths of these cops today in Baton Rouge?
[04:09.680 --> 04:11.480]  I don't know.
[04:11.480 --> 04:20.280]  The riots or protests over the police officers in Dallas, Texas, this anti-police rhetoric
[04:20.280 --> 04:27.800]  sweeping the country has turned out some hateful things inside of people that are now playing
[04:27.800 --> 04:30.280]  themselves out on the American police officer.
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.760]  I want to know, with all of the black-on-black violence in the United States of America,
[04:34.760 --> 04:36.480]  was there any reporting on it?
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.840]  Was there any black officer who was killed today?
[04:38.840 --> 04:40.080]  Was there any reporting on it?
[04:40.080 --> 04:42.920]  Yeah, please, let's just keep the volume down here.
[04:42.920 --> 04:49.040]  So I offer a solution to finally pull the plug on this propaganda mutation inhabiting
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.680]  your television.
[04:50.680 --> 04:56.680]  Please be willing to open your doors to a whole new wave of media seeking the truth.
[04:56.680 --> 05:01.800]  For truths sake, John Bown for Infowars.com.
[05:01.800 --> 05:08.400]  The mainstream media can no longer claim that President Donald Trump is Putin's puppet.
[05:08.400 --> 05:17.280]  The night I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical
[05:17.280 --> 05:25.440]  attack was launched, it is in this vital national security interest of the United States to
[05:25.440 --> 05:32.880]  prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.680]  Satellite pictures have been released of the major damage to the Syrian airfields.
[05:37.680 --> 05:44.880]  Meanwhile, Russia has responded by diverting warships to protect the Syrian coast and bolster
[05:44.880 --> 05:52.320]  missile defenses against further U.S. strikes, as fear grows that this crisis could escalate
[05:52.320 --> 05:57.000]  into a major conflict between the United States and Russia.
[05:57.000 --> 06:26.000]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[06:26.000 --> 06:37.680]  Please be willing to open your doors to a whole new wave of media seeking the truth.
[06:37.680 --> 06:41.920]  1776, we'll commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[06:43.920 --> 06:47.040]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[06:48.880 --> 06:51.960]  I am sworn upon the author of God,
[06:51.960 --> 06:57.960]  internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[07:00.520 --> 07:05.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[07:05.680 --> 07:09.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[07:12.680 --> 07:18.680]  April 9th, 2017 on this live Global Sunday transmission on Alex Jones.
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.680]  Coming in every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[07:22.680 --> 07:26.680]  Nightly news, 7 o'clock Central. Find out all the tales at infowars.com.
[07:26.680 --> 07:29.680]  infowars.com for its last show.
[07:29.680 --> 07:34.680]  Alright, I've been very deliberative since we got word last Wednesday
[07:34.680 --> 07:37.680]  that Trump was going to launch airstrikes probably and then on Thursday
[07:37.680 --> 07:41.680]  I put out a video predicting exactly how it would lay out.
[07:41.680 --> 07:45.680]  That he would do it probably simultaneously as the communist Chinese dictator
[07:45.680 --> 07:50.680]  arrived in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, there from Palm Beach, flying in from China.
[07:50.680 --> 07:54.680]  And I laid out the fact that guaranteed the Russians will be warned ahead of time.
[07:54.680 --> 07:57.680]  It'll be a cosmetic strike on the chemical weapons base
[07:57.680 --> 08:00.680]  where they were supposed to get rid of the chemical weapons.
[08:00.680 --> 08:03.680]  In an agreement four years ago, the Russians were supposed to fly them out.
[08:03.680 --> 08:06.680]  Well, there were so many chemical weapons that Assad had
[08:06.680 --> 08:10.680]  and so many chemical weapons that Hillary had allowed the rebels to bring in
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.680]  out of Libya. That's been mainstream news as well.
[08:13.680 --> 08:16.680]  We just don't have memories. You can pull the articles up yourself.
[08:16.680 --> 08:18.680]  It's like Associated Press, you name it.
[08:18.680 --> 08:22.680]  That the Russians for some reason didn't get the chemical weapons out.
[08:22.680 --> 08:27.680]  And then supposedly the Pentagon has released the flight track from the air base
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.680]  over the village and the planes turn around and go back to their base.
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.680]  They're in Syria and the Daily Mail and others have gotten photos from the Pentagon
[08:37.680 --> 08:45.680]  that show Syrian chemical weapons which were similar to the chemical weapons
[08:45.680 --> 08:51.680]  that were also held in Libya and transferred there.
[08:51.680 --> 08:54.680]  I just want to pull back for a moment.
[08:54.680 --> 09:01.680]  Why would Assad in a six-year western-backed civil war against al-Qaeda
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.680]  when the United States is driving them out of the east of the country into Iraq
[09:06.680 --> 09:10.680]  in a pencil move with U.S. forces in both countries smashing them together?
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.680]  Why would they use chemical weapons when that's the red line
[09:14.680 --> 09:19.680]  that Trump said, if you do do that, I won't be like Obama, I will strike you?
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.680]  Why when you're winning and you haven't done it, would you do it?
[09:22.680 --> 09:24.680]  Now, I'll get in 2013 mainstream news.
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.680]  It's up on Infowars.com. Paul Watson has articles titled,
[09:28.680 --> 09:32.680]  Ron Paul Says Syrian Chemical Attack of False Flag.
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.680]  And then it's Ron Paul laying out the U.N. ambassadors
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.680]  and the international medical organizations and others.
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.680]  Mainstream news here confirmed it was the rebels launching chemical attacks
[09:45.680 --> 09:50.680]  on the Syrians inside populated areas for a frame-up.
[09:50.680 --> 09:53.680]  If you scroll down on the article, Ron Paul, chemical weapons attack in Syria,
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.680]  likely a false flag, zero chance of Assad behind the attacks as former congressman.
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.680]  You scroll down on that article, we have links to the New York Times
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.680]  and the Washington Post and Seymour Hirsch and everybody saying all of that,
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.680]  the U.N. saying it.
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.680]  So people forget and mainstream news saying Hillary transferred lethal chemical weapons stockpiles
[10:14.680 --> 10:17.680]  to the rebels. And then it's the very stockpiles.
[10:17.680 --> 10:20.680]  See, the rebels aren't fully under global of control.
[10:20.680 --> 10:23.680]  They get allowed in, then they want to celebrate to be rock stars online.
[10:23.680 --> 10:26.680]  Here in America you want to be a rock star, a movie star, a sports star, to be cool.
[10:26.680 --> 10:29.680]  There, you're Al Qaeda, you're ISIS, you're Al Nuzra, same group.
[10:29.680 --> 10:32.680]  You want to do that.
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.680]  And so they would videotape themselves launching the attacks and brag about it.
[10:37.680 --> 10:40.680]  That was a big problem for the controlled media here going to blame it on Assad.
[10:40.680 --> 10:43.680]  But here's the big issue you got to know.
[10:43.680 --> 10:45.680]  Assad did not start the civil war.
[10:45.680 --> 10:49.680]  Assad did not bring in the forces out of Saudi Arabia.
[10:49.680 --> 10:51.680]  Assad didn't do anything. He was secular.
[10:51.680 --> 10:54.680]  Women went to college. They didn't wear burqas.
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.680]  He was a stabilizing force, just like Muammar Qaddafi, but not even as bad as him.
[10:59.680 --> 11:02.680]  Qaddafi 10 years ago came in out of the dark to work with the West.
[11:02.680 --> 11:05.680]  They set him up a few years later and took him out.
[11:05.680 --> 11:09.680]  Assad was trying to work with the West. He was raised in England.
[11:09.680 --> 11:12.680]  And Saudi Arabia once controlled that entire region.
[11:12.680 --> 11:15.680]  They took Syria over during the last century for a while.
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.680]  Saudi Arabia is what runs the Sunni, Wahhabist dominant form of Islam.
[11:20.680 --> 11:22.680]  They're the ones that have bought off our politicians.
[11:22.680 --> 11:25.680]  They're the ones starting the wars all over the planet.
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.680]  And they want to take out any country like Iraq or Syria that they don't control.
[11:30.680 --> 11:34.680]  And if Assad did one thing to us, I'd say, sure, get rid of him.
[11:34.680 --> 11:37.680]  But they don't want new states there that are good. They want failed states.
[11:37.680 --> 11:46.680]  So, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Lindsey Graham, McCain, Google was involved.
[11:46.680 --> 11:50.680]  Seven years ago in the Arab Spring, they funded it, starting in Tunisia, overthrowing our allies,
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.680]  Hassan Mubarak in Egypt, putting Muslim Brotherhood to kill tens of thousands of people,
[11:55.680 --> 11:59.680]  blow up hundreds of churches. That's still happening today.
[11:59.680 --> 12:03.680]  This day, happening in the day, on Palm Sunday.
[12:03.680 --> 12:06.680]  All this is going on, all this is happening.
[12:06.680 --> 12:09.680]  He goes in and meets with the rebels during the Civil War.
[12:09.680 --> 12:12.680]  He goes back a month ago and now all this happens.
[12:12.680 --> 12:16.680]  We're on the wrong side of history because Assad didn't start it.
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.680]  Our criminal government started it.
[12:18.680 --> 12:24.680]  And General Flynn helped expose it and lead a team of military leaders to say no to this.
[12:24.680 --> 12:27.680]  And I said, our military has found its soul again.
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.680]  And it's told Obama, we're not going to be Al Qaeda's Air Force there.
[12:30.680 --> 12:33.680]  We're not going to be part of this.
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.680]  And that's the history. They call me a conspiracy theorist, hoping you're stupid
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.680]  and think someone that's well researched and well spoken and who spends their life being informed
[12:43.680 --> 12:46.680]  is making this up, hoping you have the memory of a goldfish.
[12:46.680 --> 12:50.680]  As I say every day, as Gruber said, thank God you have no memory.
[12:50.680 --> 12:52.680]  Thank God you're so stupid. Thank God you're a goldfish.
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.680]  You're not a goldfish. You're a man. Act like one. You're a woman.
[12:56.680 --> 12:58.680]  And I'm not lecturing our audience.
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.680]  Our audience is super informed, super angry and saying I'm not going far enough with anger at Trump.
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.680]  But I'm going to lay out the two paradigms when I come back in the next segment.
[13:07.680 --> 13:10.680]  And we've got big breaking news that they haven't even gotten to yet.
[13:10.680 --> 13:17.680]  Exclusive intel that nobody else has got that's huge.
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.680]  But the globalists with Saudi Arabia are spreading radical Islam everywhere.
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.680]  They're using it against Russia. They just bombed Russia last week.
[13:25.680 --> 13:28.680]  And Al Qaeda took, slash ISIS took credit.
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.680]  Same group, well hobbyists, they keep going back to that because they confuse the names.
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.680]  And you just saw attack in Stockholm and notice you didn't see any images on the news
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.680]  of what is it 10 people he killed and a bunch of others reportedly targeting children
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.680]  as he ran them over and then somebody else with another car rammed into him.
[13:46.680 --> 13:48.680]  Now they're saying all cars have to be driverless.
[13:48.680 --> 13:50.680]  No, how about we don't ship radical Muslims in?
[13:50.680 --> 13:56.680]  He was an asylum seeker who was set to be deported.
[13:56.680 --> 13:59.680]  Turkey three weeks ago called for Jihad attacks in Europe.
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.680]  The same day that happened one on London Bridge or the bridge coming over by Big Bend.
[14:04.680 --> 14:07.680]  They're on the Thames or whatever you call it.
[14:07.680 --> 14:12.680]  I mean this is just crazy ladies and gentlemen.
[14:12.680 --> 14:16.680]  And he called for Jihad and holy war in Europe.
[14:16.680 --> 14:18.680]  And now it's happening.
[14:18.680 --> 14:20.680]  And so notice you don't see the dead children.
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.680]  Here it is suspected Stockholm killer is rejected asylum seeker.
[14:24.680 --> 14:27.680]  The telegraph Stockholm attack driver deliberately targeted young children
[14:27.680 --> 14:31.680]  as he drove hijacked Lordy into crowd.
[14:31.680 --> 14:32.680]  Think about that.
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.680]  So the revolution our government started in Syria blew down those borders.
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.680]  It borders the east of Europe.
[14:40.680 --> 14:42.680]  Turkey is now part of Europe.
[14:42.680 --> 14:44.680]  Ergun has now allied with them.
[14:44.680 --> 14:45.680]  He always was.
[14:45.680 --> 14:47.680]  He's allied with ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria.
[14:47.680 --> 14:55.680]  They're now pouring across and the dictator of Turkey says you will let in millions more Muslims per quarter
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.680]  and you'll give us hundreds of billions of dollars or we will have them burn down your cities.
[14:59.680 --> 15:00.680]  He snaps his fingers.
[15:00.680 --> 15:06.680]  The Turks come out in mass and the Germans and the Swedes and the Dutch and everybody who are so Stockholm syndrome.
[15:06.680 --> 15:08.680]  They all roll over and start begging.
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.680]  You know who's not begging Poland, Hungary, Romania, Russia.
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.680]  They've all been invaded by the Muslims hundreds of times.
[15:16.680 --> 15:21.680]  Europe, Western Europe's never had the Muslims invade because Eastern Europe already stopped it.
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.680]  Eastern Europeans have got dark hair because they got overrun and raped so many times by the Muslims.
[15:27.680 --> 15:30.680]  This to them is in their DNA.
[15:30.680 --> 15:31.680]  They know it.
[15:31.680 --> 15:33.680]  Grandma told them about it.
[15:33.680 --> 15:40.680]  And so our government allied with the Muslims is waging war against Eastern Europe and against Russia.
[15:40.680 --> 15:48.680]  Hell, they gave a third of Serbia a few years ago to the Muslims out of Albania who are Wahhabist who invaded with Saudi Arabian funding.
[15:48.680 --> 15:50.680]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[15:50.680 --> 15:53.680]  Total Islamic invasion with NATO running it.
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.680]  And meanwhile, they say going and taking Assad out is going to stop that.
[15:58.680 --> 16:00.680]  No, it's going to turn it over to them.
[16:00.680 --> 16:02.680]  Dr. Grip, you developed living defense for us.
[16:02.680 --> 16:03.680]  It took you over a year to do it.
[16:03.680 --> 16:04.680]  Why is this so good?
[16:04.680 --> 16:10.680]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.680]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[16:15.680 --> 16:27.680]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[16:27.680 --> 16:29.680]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[16:29.680 --> 16:31.680]  These are all parasites.
[16:31.680 --> 16:33.680]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[16:33.680 --> 16:34.680]  You have the neem in there.
[16:34.680 --> 16:37.680]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[16:37.680 --> 16:41.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.680]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[16:45.680 --> 16:46.680]  It just came back in yesterday.
