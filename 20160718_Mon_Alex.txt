[00:00.000 --> 00:25.600]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 18, 2016.
[00:25.600 --> 00:28.520]  Today is the day that the RNC officially begins.
[00:28.520 --> 00:34.040]  Of course, we've had a lot of delegates, officials, reporters for the, I guess, about
[00:34.040 --> 00:40.760]  the middle of last week, and we have begun over the weekend before the convention actually
[00:40.760 --> 00:41.760]  began.
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.840]  We were running the banners behind the plane, Hillary for Prison.
[00:45.840 --> 00:48.360]  You can see those reports on Infowars.com.
[00:48.360 --> 00:52.200]  You can see our news director, Rob Dew, writing in one of the planes.
[00:52.200 --> 00:54.280]  You can also see what it looks like from the ground.
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.040]  They enacted a no-fly zone, but we have other ways to get the message out.
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.720]  There's, if you're watching the live video feed there, there's the banner that we had
[01:02.720 --> 01:03.800]  flying over the weekend.
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.200]  Of course, Alex Jones is there, along with many of our Infowars reporters.
[01:08.200 --> 01:11.720]  I'm here in the studio, but they're going to be joining us throughout the show with
[01:11.720 --> 01:18.320]  reports of what's happening there, as well as today is the day of the large pro-Trump
[01:18.320 --> 01:21.440]  rally that we've been talking about for some time.
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.800]  This is the one that's the America First Unity rally that was put together by Roger Stone,
[01:25.800 --> 01:26.960]  Alex Jones.
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.280]  Many people are going to be there.
[01:28.280 --> 01:32.640]  At that rally today, we're going to be having a live feed from that rally, as well as a
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.760]  feed of the speeches from Alex Jones and others.
[01:36.760 --> 01:44.080]  Of course, we also had Alex encountering the Turd Blossom multiple times, both before
[01:44.080 --> 01:49.960]  he took off on the flight and after, he saw Carl Rove at the airport, and so we have another
[01:49.960 --> 01:52.080]  update of the encounter between the two of them.
[01:52.080 --> 01:57.520]  Of course, Turd Blossom was not my name for Carl Rove, but the name that was given to
[01:57.520 --> 02:02.520]  him by the man who perhaps knows him the best, George W. Bush.
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.560]  We'll tell you what that name means if you haven't figured it out yet, but we're going
[02:07.560 --> 02:10.000]  to have a clip of that that will play for you.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.880]  There's also some updates as to what's going on in the Republican Convention.
[02:15.880 --> 02:18.640]  It officially begins, as I pointed out today.
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.320]  We look at the conventions that are going to be held this week and next week.
[02:23.320 --> 02:28.200]  For the most part, it's a party with a small p.
[02:28.200 --> 02:31.120]  That's essentially what our political conventions have become.
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.840]  They've become essentially a free press conference for the two mainstream political parties.
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.200]  Although this year, it's going to be a bit different with all the Black Lives Matter
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.800]  threats with the shootings of police, with the threats of massive riots at both conventions,
[02:45.800 --> 02:48.680]  and so we're anxiously waiting to see what's going to happen there.
[02:48.680 --> 02:53.040]  We're going to look at what the head of the police union in Cleveland has said, both about
[02:53.040 --> 02:59.880]  Obama's comments, never putting any responsibility on the cold-blooded murders of the police,
[02:59.880 --> 03:05.360]  but always telling the police that they need to behave when they are, in fact, behaving
[03:05.360 --> 03:08.520]  the way the federal government wants them to behave, the way the federal government
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.520]  has trained them.
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.720]  And of course, the federal government wants to take over control of the police.
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.760]  They want to equip them as if they are a military, paramilitary force.
[03:17.760 --> 03:19.480]  They want to militarize them, federalize them.
[03:19.480 --> 03:23.360]  We're going to talk a little bit about what I think should happen, and that is that they
[03:23.360 --> 03:24.840]  should be privatized.
[03:24.840 --> 03:26.720]  We've mentioned that briefly before.
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.960]  I think the key is that we not allow the police to get farther and farther from our control.
[03:33.960 --> 03:36.160]  We need local control of the police.
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.920]  That's why we have the chief law enforcement officer, and every jurisdiction is the sheriff,
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.800]  and he's elected.
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.680]  We look at the police departments where a lot of these problems are happening.
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.040]  They are following the orders, and they're only accountable to the city manager or to
[03:52.040 --> 03:53.040]  the mayor.
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.880]  In many cases where these initial problems begin, they are focused on trying to get revenue
[03:59.880 --> 04:01.680]  for the city government.
[04:01.680 --> 04:04.360]  We need to have more control at the local level.
[04:04.360 --> 04:07.400]  We need to have people that are going to be peace officers.
[04:07.400 --> 04:12.240]  Remember that obsolete term, remember when that used to be an authentic term, and it
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.000]  didn't wreak sarcasm when you said it?
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.080]  That's what we need to get back to.
[04:17.080 --> 04:22.440]  We did have a point in time where the police responded to the people, and actually it's
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.600]  not a fantasy, as we pointed out, it's actually in practice now in many different ways.
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.320]  There's a lot of private policing already, and so we can learn from that, and we can
[04:32.320 --> 04:33.320]  expand on that.
[04:33.320 --> 04:39.600]  We need to make sure that the police are accountable, that they are not being turned into a military
[04:39.600 --> 04:41.640]  force by the federal government.
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.680]  That is the key, and we're going to take a look at what's going on with that as well
[04:45.680 --> 04:51.040]  as the convention, some RNC politics, how they're trying to move us in different directions,
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.920]  and we're also going to look at some pushback in France against open borders.
[04:55.920 --> 04:58.400]  People realize that this is about creating a civil war.
[04:58.400 --> 04:59.640]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[04:59.640 --> 05:04.200]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones, but recent studies link
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.200]  cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[05:08.200 --> 05:11.600]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[05:11.600 --> 05:16.280]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable, so keep
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.320]  the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.920]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your
[05:24.920 --> 05:30.480]  sperm, lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[05:30.480 --> 05:33.120]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[05:33.120 --> 05:36.600]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is
[05:36.600 --> 05:41.160]  actually disrupting your sleep rhythms, this causes insomnia and slow thumb metabolism.
[05:41.160 --> 05:45.800]  Hello, weight gain, generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting
[05:45.800 --> 05:50.200]  radio frequency radiation, so keep your phone in airplane mode when you can, keep the phone
[05:50.200 --> 05:54.720]  at least two feet away from your body, use headphones, and when you're not on your phone,
[05:54.720 --> 05:56.600]  keep it as far away from you as possible.
[05:56.600 --> 06:26.560]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo with your InfoWars tip of the week.
[06:26.600 --> 06:56.520]  I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo with your InfoWars tip of the week.
[06:57.600 --> 07:03.920]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been
[07:03.920 --> 07:05.920]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.040]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:10.040 --> 07:15.240]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.960]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[07:18.960 --> 07:22.640]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.200]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[07:27.200 --> 07:29.640]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[07:29.640 --> 07:35.120]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:35.120 --> 07:40.880]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:40.880 --> 07:42.520]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:42.520 --> 07:44.440]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:44.440 --> 07:48.720]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.960]  any optimum health regimen.
