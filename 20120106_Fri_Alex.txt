[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:44.640]  We're live, my friends. Thank you so much for joining us as we watch the world inch
[00:44.640 --> 00:52.320]  and then hop and then leap towards giant military conflict with Iran, China, and more, while
[00:52.320 --> 00:58.600]  the traitorous government that has taken control of our republic is actually moving our jobs
[00:58.600 --> 01:01.280]  as fast as they can to China.
[01:01.280 --> 01:07.680]  A schizophrenic policy, but there is a method to the madness. Now, coming up at the bottom
[01:07.680 --> 01:14.340]  of the second hour, Charlotte Thompson Iserby will be joining us, expert on the brainwashing
[01:14.340 --> 01:21.800]  and dumbing down of our republic. She will be joining us, and I'll also get her to talk
[01:21.800 --> 01:25.000]  some about her father and grandfather who were skull and bones.
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.720]  And she has publicly said that she believes that our hour long piece on skull and bones
[01:32.720 --> 01:40.440]  is the best report ever done on it. She's the lady that, of course, leaked the information
[01:40.440 --> 01:45.280]  to Anthony Sutton decades ago that first exposed skull and bones, what was going on there.
[01:45.280 --> 01:49.280]  And since then, it's all been confirmed. But she showed us even more books, documents,
[01:49.280 --> 01:53.160]  and things that were internal skull and bones. Never before seen, that interview is posted
[01:53.160 --> 02:01.120]  at prisonplanet.tv. Charlotte Iserby, Skull and Bones, blown wide open.
[02:01.120 --> 02:07.120]  We also are gonna have Tyrell Ventura pop in. Remember, Jesse Ventura was on the show
[02:07.120 --> 02:11.800]  last Thursday. He was planning to leave Friday or Saturday morning in his RV because he won't
[02:11.800 --> 02:18.700]  fly because of the TSA to drive down through the United States into Mexico and down to
[02:18.700 --> 02:23.280]  Baja for a few months during the coldest months in Minnesota.
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.600]  That didn't stop the corporate media and Fox News linked up groups like TMZ to claim that
[02:30.600 --> 02:36.840]  Jesse had been road raging and stopped by the police going to the airport. It was funny
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.280]  cuz I talked to him the day before he was in Minnesota, but they don't care. They just
[02:40.280 --> 02:42.600]  said he's road raging, wasn't true.
[02:42.600 --> 02:51.120]  They were forced to do a retraction. He thought it was probably a psyop. And now they've got
[02:51.120 --> 02:58.800]  the super sniper because at Fallujah and other Turkey shoots, any type of uprising enrolls
[02:58.800 --> 03:05.840]  the giant military and they just call them terrorist. And this guy has come out and talked
[03:05.840 --> 03:12.960]  about sucker punching Jesse Ventura and then running off.
[03:12.960 --> 03:20.140]  Running from him, but very weird. And it turns out Jesse was there at McPhee's bar, the Navy
[03:20.140 --> 03:25.280]  Seal bar then he was there for an event. And I went and looked up articles about it and
[03:25.280 --> 03:29.840]  I saw people commenting who were seals and they were there and said, I was there this
[03:29.840 --> 03:31.400]  didn't happen or we would have seen this.
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.240]  We would have heard of this. So I called Ty last night who's here in the US Ventura Sun.
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.800]  I've worked with on the show conspiracy theory and he hadn't heard of it yet. He said what?
[03:41.800 --> 03:48.000]  I would have heard about that and my dad wouldn't say seals deserve to die. He said I know that's
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.520]  not true. And I've seen Jesse around veterans and others. I know that's not true as well.
[03:53.520 --> 03:58.760]  Very bizarre. But I went and looked up this guy turns out he runs a mercenary group out
[03:58.760 --> 04:02.120]  of North Texas.
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.040]  They did a profile on him in Texas Monthly. I didn't read the article. I was at my parents
[04:06.040 --> 04:09.340]  last month and opened it up as I've been profiled in Texas Monthly. I thought, let me see what's
[04:09.340 --> 04:13.000]  in here. And he was wearing like an outfit and a skull hat and all this stuff. And I
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.480]  was like, man, how cheesy.
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.800]  37 years old and acts like a kid wearing a skull hat. I mean, if you're gonna kill hundreds
[04:20.800 --> 04:24.440]  of people and he talks about shooting a woman and all this stuff, at least don't wear a
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.360]  skull hat, pal. I mean, you ought to be around enough death to not like it. It's kinda like
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.680]  when your dad catches you with cigarettes and puts you in a room with three packs of
[04:32.680 --> 04:33.680]  them.
[04:33.680 --> 04:39.080]  That tends to break you of it. Okay, skull hats. I mean, it's just the Nazis did that.
[04:39.080 --> 04:43.280]  I mean, just getting into death. Okay, we'll see where that takes us to society. So I don't
[04:43.280 --> 04:47.700]  wanna spend a lot of time on this today. But Bill O'Reilly had the guy on. I knew this
[04:47.700 --> 04:52.520]  would get big when I called Ty yesterday. It's got all the earmarks of a psyop and the
[04:52.520 --> 04:54.520]  guy's got a book out.
[04:54.520 --> 05:01.860]  And he's tied into a group militarizing US law enforcement with the Israelis. Hi, folks,

[06:06.000 --> 06:11.480]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[06:11.480 --> 06:13.440]  from underneath Americans at home.
[06:13.440 --> 06:18.760]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[06:18.760 --> 06:19.760]  the shots.
[06:19.760 --> 06:24.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:24.560 --> 06:30.200]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[06:30.200 --> 06:34.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:34.800 --> 06:39.240]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[06:39.240 --> 06:41.400]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[06:41.400 --> 06:47.240]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[06:47.240 --> 06:48.240]  of the republic.

[08:00.360 --> 08:06.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:06.280 --> 08:31.080]  a war on for your mind.
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.760]  Well, we've got a big transmission lined up for you today. The world is obviously getting
[08:36.760 --> 08:45.600]  crazier by the minute. It is Friday, already the sixth day of January, 2012. I keep saying
[08:45.600 --> 08:53.760]  2011, but here we are in 2012. Charlotte Thompson Iserby, who was the head of policy at the
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.680]  Department of Education, will be joining us to break down the nexus between Skull and
[08:59.680 --> 09:09.120]  Bones and German and British psychiatry in its early embryonic stages close to 200 years
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.520]  ago, establishing the modern system that we live under today.
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.960]  And she has republished a revised, updated, and abridged edition. So it's not Dallas phone
[09:20.960 --> 09:24.640]  book size, it's just a thick book full of documents. The Deliberate Dumbing Down of
[09:24.640 --> 09:29.520]  America that's been out of print for over a year. It is now back and available at in
[09:29.520 --> 09:32.840]  fullwars.com. She'll be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[09:32.840 --> 09:40.240]  Now, later in the hour, I'm gonna get into this because it's a great example of a psyop
[09:40.240 --> 09:48.920]  and it's a mystery. And that of course is Bill O'Reilly last night headline America's
[09:48.920 --> 09:56.000]  most lethal Navy SEAL sniper tells gripping tale about killing savages and decking Jesse
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.480]  Ventura. Jesse, as you know, former governor of Minnesota, love him, hate him, he tells
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.460]  the truth or what he believes the truth is, and he lets the chips fall where they may.
[10:09.460 --> 10:16.200]  He's anti globalist war, he's anti lying about WMDs. He's upset about what really woke him
[10:16.200 --> 10:21.860]  up was McNamara before he died coming to Harvard when Ventura was there as a professor, visiting
[10:21.860 --> 10:26.880]  scholar and admitted to him personally that he'd staged the Gulf of Tonkin.
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.080]  That's just the way they did things that made Jesse very, very upset and finally pretty
[10:31.080 --> 10:39.200]  much woke him up. But it's a mystery because Jesse was on with us last Thursday. He was
[10:39.200 --> 10:43.000]  planning to leave that Friday or Saturday wasn't sure yet to drive in his RV down to
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.660]  Mexico for a few months. They're in the coldest parts of Minnesota winters. And when I called
[10:48.660 --> 10:54.880]  Tyrell his son yesterday, a filmmaker, and said, hey, have you talked to your dad?
[10:54.880 --> 10:58.560]  And he said, yeah, he crossed into Mexico this morning. My mom's cell phone doesn't
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.080]  work till he gets to Baja. He's got to drive an hour to a landline just to talk to me there
[11:03.080 --> 11:12.280]  because he lives literally an hour from pavement and power lines. He's got solar, basically
[11:12.280 --> 11:17.080]  going primitive. And I said, well, that's not good news, buddy, because I said, your
[11:17.080 --> 11:18.700]  dad's gonna want to respond to this.
[11:18.700 --> 11:23.720]  It's gonna be big news. I can tell, I said, it's a psy-op. I can tell the way they're
[11:23.720 --> 11:27.760]  rolling it out, whether part of it's true or none of it's true. This is gonna be all
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.500]  over national television. He said, what is it? I said, you haven't heard. This is about
[11:32.500 --> 11:34.520]  six o'clock last night when I got a hold of him.
[11:34.520 --> 11:40.920]  And he called me back, I texted him, said, you want to call me right now? Because I wasn't
[11:40.920 --> 11:45.340]  sure at first when I got home early yesterday. I shot the news earlier and did an interview
[11:45.340 --> 11:52.360]  and then went home. Until I started researching the Navy SEAL that's doing this and red flags,
[11:52.360 --> 11:54.640]  about 20 of them popped up right away.
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.980]  And I can't really, with all the other important news, do this justice. But I'll probably shoot
[11:59.980 --> 12:05.200]  a special report about this, not because it's even about Jesse Ventura and he's my friend
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.440]  and I stick up for friends. I don't stick up for friends unless they're in the right,
[12:10.440 --> 12:16.080]  okay? And when I went and researched this sniper, it got really creepy real fast.
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.080]  He's part of a liaison group and has gotten awards from an Israeli group that's advising
[12:21.080 --> 12:28.080]  US law enforcement and preparing them to fight domestic terrorist. Integrates in with a TSA
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.800]  checkpoints with machine guns that were in Florida yesterday. He runs a mercenary group
[12:32.800 --> 12:40.420]  out of North Texas for security and sniper equipment for the US military and police training.
[12:40.420 --> 12:47.180]  And he's being set up as a new celebrity for this domestic crackdown and was probably told
[12:47.180 --> 12:52.720]  to do this as his test to get into intelligence. I know the SEALs are heavily involved in intelligence,
[12:52.720 --> 13:01.720]  but watching his body language, Whether there's any truth to what he's saying about Ventura
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.760]  or not, the whole way it's packaged as a psyop to destroy Jesse Ventura.
[13:06.760 --> 13:09.520]  That's what I told Ty last night. I said, you watch, they're gonna have this on every
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.360]  big TV show and now it's happening. I said, this is a psyop, I can see the roll out. It's
[13:14.360 --> 13:19.800]  like seeing a Coca Cola commercial, you know it's slickly done. The big book from the biggest
[13:19.800 --> 13:23.680]  publisher, it's not just about selling books though.
[13:23.680 --> 13:29.080]  They're setting this guy up to be kind of like their new little Eric Prince, but on
[13:29.080 --> 13:36.460]  a smaller stage and as a front guy. And man, as we're doing the research, I couldn't quit
[13:36.460 --> 13:41.460]  researching because I'm involved in it at a certain level. This guy up here doing it
[13:41.460 --> 13:42.460]  as a Texan.
[13:42.460 --> 13:46.500]  I'm involved in it because I'm friends with Jesse and work on his TV show and I've gotten
[13:46.500 --> 13:52.700]  to know him really well over the years. And then it adds to it that I can't get a hold
[13:52.700 --> 13:58.560]  of Jesse. And it'll be a couple more days until we can get a hold of him probably. Because
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.260]  he doesn't, whenever you got cell phones, he's like, I hate those things.
[14:03.260 --> 14:09.540]  And then there's other stuff, when we went out to dinner, Jesse and his wife and I, after
[14:09.540 --> 14:14.620]  we'd done a lot of interviews and investigations out in the high desert in a private rocket
[14:14.620 --> 14:20.280]  base. That's why we were in the Vegas area, one of the reasons, looking at the private
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.780]  space program out there.
[14:23.780 --> 14:29.140]  And the fact of is it a cover for a clandestine government operation? Do bears do certain
[14:29.140 --> 14:33.540]  things in the woods? I mean, come on. And we went to dinner at like 11 o'clock at night
[14:33.540 --> 14:39.940]  after we were done working all day. And he was complaining about the media. And he said,
[14:39.940 --> 14:43.780]  if I run for president, they're gonna make all sorts of stuff up, which they've now done,
[14:43.780 --> 14:45.740]  claiming he's road raging.
[14:45.740 --> 14:52.260]  Totally not true, just made up. And they had to retract it, but tiny little retraction.
[14:52.260 --> 14:58.620]  And he had the CIA visit him when he was first elected governor and sworn in. He came down
[14:58.620 --> 15:02.260]  into the basement, they called him into the Capitol, there was 23 of them. And they wouldn't
[15:02.260 --> 15:03.900]  say who they were, but they were CIA.
[15:03.900 --> 15:09.220]  And it looked like the old lady next door. And they were basically assessing him and
[15:09.220 --> 15:13.460]  trying to intimidate him. And then he of course found out his house phone was tapped and a
[15:13.460 --> 15:17.020]  bunch of other dirty tricks happened. And he said, Alex, I care about this country,
[15:17.020 --> 15:20.100]  but I just don't think enough people wanna be free.
[15:20.100 --> 15:25.900]  And he said, besides, I have reporters, people ask me with no evidence about, were you in
[15:25.900 --> 15:30.740]  California or Nevada dancing on the table last year drunk? And Alex, you know I don't
[15:30.740 --> 15:35.660]  drink cuz I have to take blood thinner because of my blood clots I've had from wrestling
[15:35.660 --> 15:36.660]  accidents.
[15:36.660 --> 15:41.540]  When Jesse flies, he has to put on these things on his legs so he didn't get blood clots.
[15:41.540 --> 15:45.760]  Back when I'd fly with him, I'd seen adjusting him or whatever. I mean, this is a serious
[15:45.760 --> 15:50.380]  medical issue. And he doesn't fly, but there they are in the news saying Jesse Ventura
[15:50.380 --> 15:55.260]  at an airport, running to the airport, road raging, that was a fake report.
[15:55.260 --> 16:01.340]  And I'm already digressing off into this. It's just that he talked about how they would
[16:01.340 --> 16:07.820]  probably try to plant fake stories on him. And so now it's kind of started and because
[16:07.820 --> 16:11.900]  he did talk to libertarians and others and was considering trying to get the libertarian
[16:11.900 --> 16:19.180]  nomination. And it just looks like that the system now wants to try to discredit him.
[16:19.180 --> 16:23.260]  And I don't know once we get him on the show or once he says something about this, if the
[16:23.260 --> 16:29.180]  guy really did sucker punch him and then run away. But what I know Jesse didn't say and
[16:29.180 --> 16:35.880]  what Tyrell says, there's no way his father would say. Because I've talked to Jesse off
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.620]  air before I've seen him in person, he got very upset when that helicopter blew up with
[16:40.620 --> 16:43.100]  the SEAL Team 6 on it.
[16:43.100 --> 16:47.940]  He gets very upset and teary eyed during the national anthem and stuff and he's really
[16:47.940 --> 16:53.140]  into being patriotic. That's why he gets so freaked out by all this. And the way this
[16:53.140 --> 17:00.660]  is all scripted, where he's on this show and a caller claims you knocked out Jesse Ventura.
[17:00.660 --> 17:05.140]  And he's like, yes, and then it looks like it's all scripted when you watch it. And he's
[17:05.140 --> 17:07.880]  looking down when he's talking about it.
[17:07.880 --> 17:14.580]  And then he goes on Fox News with Bill O'Reilly and it's all brought up. And he goes through
[17:14.580 --> 17:20.900]  all of this and says, yes, Jesse Ventura, we say the family is here of the Navy SEALs
[17:20.900 --> 17:33.700]  killed in Iraq. And Ventura's like, good, they need to die. I mean, it's just amazing.
[17:33.700 --> 17:37.080]  And then I went and did some research and found out he was there for an award ceremony.
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.420]  He was there in 2006. He did go to that bar, there's people talking about photos they took
[17:41.420 --> 17:45.780]  with him, sign deals, how some of Jesse's family was there.
[17:45.780 --> 17:49.880]  And I called Ty, he goes, yeah, I wasn't there, but I know about him going. The family would
[17:49.880 --> 17:54.500]  have said something about this. I've never heard of that. There's somebody punching him
[17:54.500 --> 17:59.340]  and then knocking him back and then didn't knock him out, but then running away.
[17:59.340 --> 18:09.000]  Because I know my dad didn't say, SEALs deserve to die. I know that's not true. And so, again,
[18:09.000 --> 18:16.460]  there now got headlines everywhere, Navy SEAL knocks out truther Ventura. And then I find
[18:16.460 --> 18:26.140]  out this guy is involved as a liaison to a group run by Dick Cheney and Richard Pearl.
[18:26.140 --> 18:29.900]  And I've got all the research right here, it's mind blowing. It's on the guy's Wikipedia
[18:29.900 --> 18:37.060]  page too with links to it. And that he gets all these awards, and that he's liaising now
[18:37.060 --> 18:43.940]  basically the training of US police, and it looks like he might be basically an Israeli
[18:43.940 --> 18:47.900]  front to train the police. Because it's been in the news, the Israelis are training police,
[18:47.900 --> 18:54.100]  and it's like a foreign government's training our police to fight domestic insurgents.
[18:54.100 --> 19:04.220]  And again, he heads up a group for, quote, diplomatic security, diplomatic level security,
[19:04.220 --> 19:08.980]  and sniper training for the military and police. And he's tied in with all these groups, and
[19:08.980 --> 19:13.420]  then he's got this top publisher coming out. And the way they're gonna promote the book
[19:13.420 --> 19:17.660]  and sell him as the new hero guy that'll come in and tell our cops to get ready to fight
[19:17.660 --> 19:23.860]  the militias, basically, is this gung ho Navy SEAL with the record number of kills.
[19:23.860 --> 19:29.220]  And then you find out it's Fallujah and other Turkey shoots where people dare rise up to
[19:29.220 --> 19:33.780]  occupation when the contractors were abusing them, we now know. And it's Turkey shoots,
[19:33.780 --> 19:39.420]  and then I researched, and he's bragging about Turkey shoots, about shooting a woman and
[19:39.420 --> 19:44.140]  they're savages, and he doesn't like folks that try to create fear. Then I got quotes
[19:44.140 --> 19:49.020]  about how he loves instilling fear, and he wears skull hats and black uniforms. I mean,
[19:49.020 --> 19:53.960]  they're setting him up as the guy to be the Judas goat, I guess, to teach us that martial
[19:53.960 --> 20:00.300]  law is loving and good under NDAA. And he's going after Ventura.

[21:55.340 --> 22:02.340]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[22:03.740 --> 22:08.900]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[22:08.900 --> 22:12.380]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[22:12.380 --> 22:15.860]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[22:15.860 --> 22:20.420]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[22:20.420 --> 22:26.620]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply
[22:26.620 --> 22:31.140]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have
[22:31.140 --> 22:35.820]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[22:35.820 --> 22:42.660]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[24:07.860 --> 24:20.860]  All right, I'll get more into the Ventura story later. His son is up in Minnesota doing
[24:20.860 --> 24:26.180]  jury duty, and he gets out at noon central. So he should be calling into the show a little
[24:26.180 --> 24:32.060]  bit after that. So Tyrell can respond for his father. He doesn't even know this is true.
[24:32.060 --> 24:38.540]  It's just some guy getting awards from Dick Cheney and Richard Pearl, and who is helping
[24:38.540 --> 24:45.540]  train our law enforcement to deal with domestic threats. And runs a mercenary security firm,
[24:45.540 --> 24:57.220]  is now going to sell his book under the promotion of trying to defame Jesse Ventura and say
[24:57.220 --> 25:05.660]  that he looked at the family and said, I think the seals need to die.
[25:05.660 --> 25:10.180]  And I've seen so many of these dirty tricks come out of the same people. It was the New
[25:10.180 --> 25:16.820]  York Post reporter back with Jeremy Talis. And they went ahead and went to court five
[25:16.820 --> 25:22.140]  years ago. Four and a half years ago, went to court and they called the Secret Service.
[25:22.140 --> 25:26.440]  The Secret Service wouldn't lie. The New York police did lie on the stand. They're there
[25:26.440 --> 25:33.300]  to cover Mrs. Bush giving a speech, the president's wife. They're outside of Barnes and Noble.
[25:33.300 --> 25:37.180]  They're out there in front of the police. We've got their cameras. And a guy runs up
[25:37.180 --> 25:42.420]  with his daughter in a wheelchair and starts ramming it into the We Are Change people saying,
[25:42.420 --> 25:44.000]  don't attack my daughter.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.420]  Don't attack my daughter. And they're just standing there. And later it showed the security
[25:47.420 --> 25:51.980]  camera stuff showed that. All you see is him with the camera and they're running up into
[25:51.980 --> 25:56.740]  him. He's like, hey, don't do that. What are you doing? Stop it. So even their video shows
[25:56.740 --> 26:03.860]  it. And it was on the news, Truther attacks disabled girl in wheelchair.
[26:03.860 --> 26:08.660]  Like the worst thing they can think up is sitting around going, we'll set these guys
[26:08.660 --> 26:12.660]  up. We'll have our New York Post people there. They'll run with it. New York Post had to
[26:12.660 --> 26:16.420]  do a retraction, by the way, when the trial happened and the Secret Service agent got
[26:16.420 --> 26:18.220]  up and said, well, I'm not gonna lie.
[26:18.220 --> 26:23.380]  They were ramming into them. They didn't do anything. And boy, that judge got upset talking
[26:23.380 --> 26:28.540]  to Luke and others that were in there. There's no footage of it. They would have the girl
[26:28.540 --> 26:35.140]  come in in the wheelchair like a big teddy bear in her lap and try to, they could do
[26:35.140 --> 26:37.180]  something like this to me, folks.
[26:37.180 --> 26:42.420]  They could have somebody in a wheelchair as I'm walking down the street just to run into
[26:42.420 --> 26:46.580]  me and say I'm attacking children in wheelchairs. I mean, this is what they'll do. So they're
[26:46.580 --> 26:51.260]  sitting there and they go, what do we come up with? Well, we'll have Jesse Ventura says
[26:51.260 --> 26:54.500]  it's good the SEALs are dying.
[26:54.500 --> 26:58.780]  And then he punches him and then runs away. Cuz see, they know there's not gonna be any
[26:58.780 --> 27:03.740]  report of it. So the guy says, then I ran away. Right as his book comes out and he runs
[27:03.740 --> 27:09.500]  a merc firm. And he's getting weird creepy awards from, I'm gonna pull up the documents.
[27:09.500 --> 27:13.500]  I pulled them up last night and forgot to, I am with the guys, did a bunch of research.
[27:13.500 --> 27:22.420]  But I've got some of it here. It's just mind blowing to see this happen. And again, Ventura's
[27:22.420 --> 27:28.860]  out of the country. So we can't get a hold of him. They sure launched this right the
[27:28.860 --> 27:30.100]  perfect day, didn't they?
[27:30.100 --> 27:37.220]  Right as he left the United States and out of pocket. But who knows? I mean, maybe the
[27:37.220 --> 27:42.900]  guy did punch Ventura and then run off. I mean, maybe that happened. Maybe, I mean,
[27:42.900 --> 27:46.540]  Ty says it's impossible. His dad wouldn't say that. I know him and he wouldn't act like
[27:46.540 --> 27:55.540]  that. But maybe Easter bunnies are real. Maybe there are pots of gold at the end of rainbows
[27:55.540 --> 27:57.660]  and leprechauns.
[27:57.660 --> 28:04.340]  Maybe there are mermaids. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I can't say 100% that this guy's
[28:04.340 --> 28:08.120]  lying. And again, I don't usually get into soap opera type issues like this. But this
[28:08.120 --> 28:17.260]  is such a illustration of what's happened to our society. And then you look at all the
[28:17.260 --> 28:18.820]  stuff that this guy's into.
[28:18.820 --> 28:25.680]  It is just crazy. And then I've got all these articles about how they're watching the kids
[28:25.680 --> 28:31.540]  at home. The schools are over their laptops beyond 1984, just public, back on the news.
[28:31.540 --> 28:35.820]  And children, government to issue bracelets to children to track you even when you're
[28:35.820 --> 28:42.740]  at home. That's mainstream news today. I'm gonna be covering checkpoints popping up where
[28:42.740 --> 28:47.420]  the government has machine guns and searches people and checks their IDs.
[28:47.420 --> 28:52.100]  In Tennessee and Florida again this week, they're popping up in Michigan. I mean, imagine
[28:52.100 --> 28:55.640]  you're just walking down the street or driving or going in a building and there's guys in
[28:55.640 --> 29:00.020]  full body armor with German shepherds lining you up and frisking you and checking your
[29:00.020 --> 29:02.700]  IDs, bugging their eyes out at you.
[29:02.700 --> 29:06.460]  And I've got the footage of this all over the country. You pull up and there's state
[29:06.460 --> 29:14.420]  police under federal command, all in a rock ready stance, shaking with fury like they're
[29:14.420 --> 29:20.780]  about to climb in the ring and fight some 900 pound goblin. I mean, it's like they've
[29:20.780 --> 29:22.420]  been under mind control or something.
[29:22.420 --> 29:31.060]  They see a station wagon when the family pull up and they act like, it's like mind control.
[29:31.060 --> 29:36.620]  I don't know how I get out of this nightmare, how this ends, where we just try to go report
[29:36.620 --> 29:40.340]  stuff and there's a guy with a wheelchair ramming and then going, stop assaulting, stop
[29:40.340 --> 29:44.700]  assaulting. And then you learn the guy's all hooked up with George W. Bush in New York
[29:44.700 --> 29:49.700]  City and the government and government contracts.
[29:49.700 --> 30:01.980]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hi folks,
[30:01.980 --> 30:06.940]  this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity

[31:00.300 --> 31:04.500]  this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[31:04.500 --> 31:09.180]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[31:09.180 --> 31:13.160]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[31:13.160 --> 31:17.500]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again.
[31:17.500 --> 31:21.660]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[31:21.660 --> 31:27.740]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[31:27.740 --> 31:32.260]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[31:32.260 --> 31:37.640]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[31:37.640 --> 31:43.380]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[31:43.380 --> 31:54.980]  call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[31:54.980 --> 32:00.940]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. You've heard
[32:00.940 --> 32:05.860]  Alex explain how the silver lung generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[32:05.860 --> 32:10.720]  colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung
[32:10.720 --> 32:14.740]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[32:14.740 --> 32:20.900]  body. My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lung generator. Not
[32:20.900 --> 32:25.740]  only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also
[32:25.740 --> 32:30.660]  comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[32:30.660 --> 32:38.100]  solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically
[32:38.100 --> 32:43.260]  to the skin and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video
[32:43.260 --> 32:50.740]  tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system
[32:50.740 --> 32:58.980]  works. As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[32:58.980 --> 33:26.860]  So a guy rolling out a big mercenary company or your local police to meet insurgents here
[33:26.860 --> 33:31.620]  in America, all part of this delusion that domestic groups are gonna engage in all these
[33:31.620 --> 33:32.620]  attacks.
[33:32.620 --> 33:39.940]  So we need to have TSA on the streets running checkpoints. He's the guy now trying to take
[33:39.940 --> 33:46.380]  down Jesse Ventura. All this will do is probably make Jesse actually be more politically involved.
[33:46.380 --> 33:50.220]  He's actually pretty much riding off into the sunset, but they don't care. That's how
[33:50.220 --> 33:54.940]  they operate. Sell some books, say that Jesse's happy Navy SEALs are being killed.
[33:54.940 --> 34:01.240]  That is so ridiculous. On its face, I don't believe it. I mean, just the fact that he
[34:01.240 --> 34:06.420]  says this now six years later writing a book and it's not in the book, but he puts it out.
[34:06.420 --> 34:11.580]  I guess the publisher didn't want that in there, did they? I'm gonna stop talking about
[34:11.580 --> 34:12.580]  that.
[34:12.580 --> 34:17.820]  It's just intriguing when you start researching something. I remember talking to Jeremy Talis.
[34:17.820 --> 34:25.020]  That's his nickname, his full name's German Talis. And saying, okay, you're saying they
[34:25.020 --> 34:31.780]  came out of a doorway sort of ramming you with a disabled girl in a wheelchair and then
[34:31.780 --> 34:35.380]  yelling, don't attack her, don't attack her over and over again.
[34:35.380 --> 34:40.140]  And I had Michelle Malkin's people behind me screaming, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle
[34:40.140 --> 34:43.740]  Malkin and then leaving with her. So I'd experienced stuff like that. I guess that happened right
[34:43.740 --> 34:48.400]  around the same time actually. Now go back four and a half years ago, almost five years.
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.860]  So I understand those things go on. And you always know because suddenly it's in the Denver
[34:53.860 --> 34:59.800]  Post. It's all over the news. It's all over blogs within like 30 minutes with the same
[34:59.800 --> 35:00.800]  talking point.
[35:00.800 --> 35:06.900]  And then we released the video showing it's them behind her and behind me yelling it,
[35:06.900 --> 35:11.700]  but still the media wouldn't retract till I threatened to sue them. Cuz I had to, they
[35:11.700 --> 35:22.380]  were defaming me on Alex is the guy that says kill women. They're slick, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:22.380 --> 35:27.700]  And then I finally got the footage about a week later cuz he had been arrested and stuff.
[35:27.700 --> 35:31.020]  And finally saw it uploaded online and showed he wasn't attacking her, but you couldn't
[35:31.020 --> 35:32.980]  really tell cuz she's ramming in.
[35:32.980 --> 35:39.500]  And he's going stop it, stop, stop hitting me. What are you doing? And the camera turns.
[35:39.500 --> 35:47.480]  So we've got that going on. And then it comes out in court and the Secret Service agents
[35:47.480 --> 35:54.940]  wouldn't lie and said, yeah, no, they attacked him. He didn't do that. And so you never know
[35:54.940 --> 35:58.340]  what's true with all these dirty tricks going on.
[35:58.340 --> 36:03.020]  You just see that when something's rolled out a certain way, it's got the smell, it's
[36:03.020 --> 36:09.040]  got the look, it's got the signature all over it. And it just illustrates the type of dirty
[36:09.040 --> 36:16.020]  tricks we're up against. And then you find out this guy's training police. This country's
[36:16.020 --> 36:17.020]  so gone.
[36:17.020 --> 36:22.500]  I mean, it is so run by foreign banks and all the fake economic numbers they're putting
[36:22.500 --> 36:35.420]  out. And this latest report put out about how Obama's gonna cut the military. That's
[36:35.420 --> 36:41.620]  all left cover. Obama increased the overall budget for the military the last three years
[36:41.620 --> 36:43.620]  running.
[36:43.620 --> 36:47.380]  It's all smoke and mirrors. It's kinda like they claim that they've pulled out of Iraq,
[36:47.380 --> 36:51.940]  but 70 plus thousand contractors are there getting paid four or five times what regular
[36:51.940 --> 36:58.180]  enlisted troops are paid or even officers in many cases. And that's basically a puppet
[36:58.180 --> 37:05.500]  government over there. But they just tell the public the Iraq war is over.
[37:05.500 --> 37:20.100]  I mean, this is a system that is so corrupt that it openly
[37:20.100 --> 37:24.880]  grows the opium in front of everyone and has the Marines and Army and the rest of them
[37:24.880 --> 37:31.580]  guard it and grow it and then put it on aircraft because that's what patriots do. And they
[37:31.580 --> 37:36.220]  put that on Fox News, CNN, BBC with straight faces.
[37:36.220 --> 37:40.360]  And I talked to people that defend the status quo and they go, well, we've gotta help grow
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.780]  the opium or al-Qaeda will get the money. And I'm like, but you want the cops setting
[37:44.780 --> 37:51.260]  up checkpoints to find drugs that the government grew and shipped in. And it's producing 13
[37:51.260 --> 37:55.060]  times what they were pre US invasion of Afghanistan.
[37:55.060 --> 38:05.460]  Hey, our government just put al-Qaeda in charge of Libya on record. You understand that? And
[38:05.460 --> 38:08.580]  they go, yeah, well, sometimes you gotta work with al-Qaeda. But I've gotta give all my
[38:08.580 --> 38:14.200]  rights up because of al-Qaeda. And we've gotta attack Iran because they're with al-Qaeda.
[38:14.200 --> 38:18.420]  Even though the White House before this one and the current one have five different groups,
[38:18.420 --> 38:24.500]  four of them known al-Qaeda attacking the Iranians inside Iran on record.
[38:24.500 --> 38:29.780]  Even though our government created al-Qaeda, do you understand that? Do you understand
[38:29.780 --> 38:33.900]  Amor Al-Awlaki number three in al-Qaeda dined secretly with the Secretary of the Army? That's
[38:33.900 --> 38:38.420]  even Fox News. Do you understand I've interviewed the heads of the US Embassy who were ordered
[38:38.420 --> 38:43.420]  to let Mohammed Atta and others into the country and were told their terrorism designation
[38:43.420 --> 38:44.420]  is a cover.
[38:44.420 --> 38:49.620]  I've never worked for CIA. I mean, this is in the newspapers. I've interviewed the people
[38:49.620 --> 38:55.640]  that saw it happen. I've interviewed the lawyer and his wife who see the government get the
[38:55.640 --> 39:01.840]  underwear bomber on Christmas Day on the aeroplane a month and a half before the Detroit Free
[39:01.840 --> 39:04.060]  Press had to report it.
[39:04.060 --> 39:08.940]  Because it was on C-SPAN with the Undersecretary of State saying, don't blame us. We were ordered
[39:08.940 --> 39:14.940]  to help get him on the aircraft by an unnamed US agency. Intelligence, I mean, you can't
[39:14.940 --> 39:28.460]  make this up. You cannot make up the magnitude of evil we're facing as a society.
[39:28.460 --> 39:34.780]  And it's just so creepy how they've got all these well-meaning idiots that will lie, cheat,
[39:34.780 --> 39:41.280]  steal, do anything as long as you tell them you're the good guy. Yeah, we're gonna grow
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.620]  the opium and ship it out into America and Europe and everywhere else as a scourge on
[39:45.620 --> 39:48.360]  the streets because we're the good guys.
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.420]  We're gonna kill Pat Tillman because he's shooting his mouth off against the war. You're
[39:52.420 --> 39:57.060]  all gonna get promoted, let's frag him. But then the Army coroner wouldn't lie and put
[39:57.060 --> 40:01.640]  on there, it was homicide. He was killed, he was shot at three feet away with a M-16
[40:01.640 --> 40:05.300]  set on, three shot burst. And later it came out, what happened? They shot him from 100
[40:05.300 --> 40:06.300]  yards away.
[40:06.300 --> 40:09.940]  He got behind the rock, he said, why'd you do that to me? Hey, stop team, stood up, they
[40:09.940 --> 40:15.260]  tried to kill him again. He got behind there, they snuck up on him and shot him in the face.
[40:15.260 --> 40:21.960]  I mean, the military's full of people, they tell you, they'll kill Navy SEALs. All this
[40:21.960 --> 40:36.700]  patriotism, really, I talked to a Navy SEAL right here in Austin, Texas.
[40:36.700 --> 40:41.620]  And his best buddies in SEAL Team 6, and he wasn't killed in the helicopter that blew
[40:41.620 --> 40:48.660]  up in the fake bin Laden raid or the one that blew up packed with 20 plus SEAL members.
[40:48.660 --> 40:53.460]  And the word is, well, yeah, they know a bomb was on it. They think Al Qaeda got a bomb
[40:53.460 --> 40:58.500]  on the helicopter. But then they wonder, how did Al Qaeda do that? And why did they all
[40:58.500 --> 41:02.220]  get concerned that day? Because they've never been put that many of them on one of those
[41:02.220 --> 41:07.120]  old National Guard Chinook 1960s era helicopters.
[41:07.120 --> 41:11.840]  And they weren't sent out to save a group that was pinned down. So why'd the media
[41:11.840 --> 41:15.900]  lie? I mean, they don't see that it's a PR stunt. They all knew there were complaints
[41:15.900 --> 41:20.200]  when it happened. And they know there was a bomb on the helicopter, but Al Qaeda must
[41:20.200 --> 41:21.200]  have done it.
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.660]  Yeah, right, they're at the military base. Al Qaeda knew that that helicopter was gonna
[41:25.660 --> 41:32.220]  have a bunch of Navy SEALs sardined like a game of telephone booth into it. And then
[41:32.220 --> 41:36.500]  it was gonna go blow up, and they'd have a fake mission you were going on to be heroes
[41:36.500 --> 41:38.220]  for the public back at home.
[41:38.220 --> 41:44.180]  Kinda like Pat Tillman was charging a hill, fighting Al Qaeda, going up to the top of
[41:44.180 --> 41:56.260]  the hill. Just like the SEALs were going to save Army Rangers pinned down. And then it
[41:56.260 --> 42:00.820]  turned out, no, it was a resupply effort. Turns out there was no mission. They admit
[42:00.820 --> 42:01.820]  there was nothing.
[42:01.820 --> 42:05.460]  They just said, get on the helicopter and fly to this point. And the helicopter blows
[42:05.460 --> 42:10.580]  up with all of them on board. And the people that investigated, the SEALs that are alive,
[42:10.580 --> 42:16.500]  think Al Qaeda stuck a bomb on the helicopter. Come on, guys, you're so tough. You're so
[42:16.500 --> 42:23.180]  mentally tough. You got it all together. But you're so hyped up in this little cult of
[42:23.180 --> 42:27.180]  serving the New World Order that you don't see your use like garbage.
[42:27.180 --> 42:31.120]  Our military, you could say what you wanted about it, but pre-1990, they wouldn't let
[42:31.120 --> 42:38.700]  anybody use depleted uranium, nobody. Because it's a death sentence for everybody that uses
[42:38.700 --> 42:43.500]  it. You might die in a year, you might die in 20. But let me tell you, it's about like
[42:43.500 --> 42:46.760]  smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and drinking a gallon of Jack Daniels.
[42:46.760 --> 42:55.540]  I mean, it's gonna hurt you bad. And I mean, I know the troops. I mean, I know the people.
[42:55.540 --> 43:02.700]  I've got family and who's got family and folks I know who've been sick. And record numbers
[43:02.700 --> 43:09.980]  dying and birth defects. And so what if Fallujah has 14 to 16 times normal level of cancer
[43:09.980 --> 43:12.140]  and birth defects.
[43:12.140 --> 43:15.000]  And then the troops come back, especially from Fallujah, where they blew the whole place
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.380]  up with it. And then they're all dead and dying. And then you gotta hear people going,
[43:20.380 --> 43:27.000]  yeah, we care a lot about the SEALs. So I decked out Jesse Ventura. You don't talk bad
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.340]  about the SEALs, really?
[43:28.340 --> 43:32.140]  They got you guys using weapons systems. They're gonna kill you deader than a hammer. But you
[43:32.140 --> 43:36.060]  don't wanna hear that you're young and tough and you can handle it and government wouldn't
[43:36.060 --> 43:44.940]  do that to you. Yeah, did you hear Doug Rocky, Vietnam veteran combat right through service
[43:44.940 --> 43:51.180]  for decades, physicist, other PhDs, writing the book on DU, most of his team dead, he's
[43:51.180 --> 43:55.480]  had 30 something surgeries.
[43:55.480 --> 44:00.420]  This is a fact that the system doesn't care about you. It's a fact that they could care
[44:00.420 --> 44:05.500]  less. And going back to the Romans, they learned how to give them spree decor. They learned
[44:05.500 --> 44:09.700]  how to say you're the elite of the elite, so they break their backs more than anybody.
[44:09.700 --> 44:18.580]  And the special cohorts, the more elite cohorts, and they didn't really have medals then. It
[44:18.580 --> 44:23.180]  was what staff and what eagle they got to carry. And they would do anything. They'd
[44:23.180 --> 44:29.220]  march barefoot for three days through snow because they had the top signets, the top
[44:29.220 --> 44:34.140]  logos, the top banners and flags and pennants that they were carrying.
[44:34.140 --> 44:39.540]  And Napoleon wrote about how men would give their lives and throw themselves on the bayonets
[44:39.540 --> 44:46.740]  for little pieces of metal and cloth. He was the one that really deployed medals, medals.
[44:46.740 --> 44:57.260]  It's a joke. It's a joke when those medals are for empowering a corrupt empire. Empowering
[44:57.260 --> 45:02.820]  a corrupt New World Order while your own homeland, using a fascist Nazi term, by the way, this
[45:02.820 --> 45:09.840]  black uniforms, the Nazi terms, they're adopting all of the fascistic regalia.
[45:09.840 --> 45:15.800]  All the symbols, they're not hiding from it. And then they take the dead and dying veterans
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.660]  death benefits they've paid for. And that's not patriotic. Don't talk about it. Dr. Doug
[45:20.660 --> 45:24.300]  Rocky didn't wanna talk about on air, but I got him to. And he gets all these hundreds
[45:24.300 --> 45:28.100]  of calls a week and he calls the local VA and they won't help. He calls the local Veterans
[45:28.100 --> 45:29.100]  of Foreign Wars.
[45:29.100 --> 45:32.780]  He calls the local veterans groups and they just go, nope, we're not gonna help take that
[45:32.780 --> 45:38.180]  veteran to the VA. Well, he's in a wheelchair now. He's been back from Iraq for two years
[45:38.180 --> 45:44.740]  and he's a staff sergeant and he's bleeding out of his gums and out of his hind end. And
[45:44.740 --> 45:48.580]  I can't take all these people. I'm taking these guys three or four days a week and I'm
[45:48.580 --> 45:50.020]  real sick myself.
[45:50.020 --> 45:53.220]  Can you just give me some people to help me? The VA won't come pick them up. They can't.
[45:53.220 --> 45:57.340]  They're overwhelmed. And I heard this on the news today that there's so many troops coming
[45:57.340 --> 46:01.500]  back now the VA can't handle it. And you call the veterans groups up cuz they're all the
[46:01.500 --> 46:04.700]  guys that were in the military when there weren't wars or whatever.
[46:04.700 --> 46:07.460]  And they're all just kind of sitting back drinking beer. They're like, you want us to
[46:07.460 --> 46:11.900]  go take somebody into the VA or try to get a medical treatment? No, I'm gonna drink some
[46:11.900 --> 46:21.780]  beer and sit there and call people ragheads and hajis and watch Fox News. I saw the comments
[46:21.780 --> 46:26.860]  on the New York Post and places how it's all like, how great.
[46:26.860 --> 46:32.100]  He's right. They are savages. Kill them all. They're gonna kill your pension fund. They're
[46:32.100 --> 46:35.380]  gonna kill your bank account. They're gonna kill the value of your dollar. They're gonna
[46:35.380 --> 46:41.460]  take your house when it's paid for. They're gonna bring you into a hardcore depression.
[46:41.460 --> 46:46.420]  You think the New World Order is just gonna kill some brown people under 15 years of sanctions,
[46:46.420 --> 46:49.100]  a million of them that starve to death or die from medical issues?
[46:49.100 --> 46:53.900]  I've talked to the real troops that came back. They said most of those people are so debilitated
[46:53.900 --> 46:59.500]  that every once in a while if you killed their family, they'd go dig up an AK-47 and try
[46:59.500 --> 47:05.260]  to shoot you. And then it's called an insurgent. All the disease, the sewage running down the
[47:05.260 --> 47:07.420]  streets, the people starving to death.
[47:07.420 --> 47:12.180]  And anytime the contractors come in and later confirmed and mow down a bunch of innocent
[47:12.180 --> 47:16.340]  people, it's now been confirmed in federal documents. Blackwater people running around
[47:16.340 --> 47:22.120]  the streets on cocaine, naked, shooting up apartment buildings and cars. And we have
[47:22.120 --> 47:27.620]  videos of similar stuff. And then the people get mad and rise up against it. And so the
[47:27.620 --> 47:32.660]  entire US military lines up and levels the city, and they got snipers racking up their
[47:32.660 --> 47:33.660]  record kills.
[47:33.660 --> 47:38.020]  Well, yeah, cuz in World War II and Vietnam, they're actually fighting an enemy that shot
[47:38.020 --> 47:45.140]  back. Actual soldiers, actual warriors. It wasn't a bunch of starving people running
[47:45.140 --> 47:51.380]  around with drones and sward robots going in, and just carpet bombing everything and
[47:51.380 --> 47:57.420]  heavy artillery leveling. And what, maybe 1,000 people out of tens of thousands decided
[47:57.420 --> 48:00.260]  to stand up?
[48:00.260 --> 48:04.920]  And it's just anybody moving in an area, shoot them. And it's like, it's legendary. We can
[48:04.920 --> 48:12.380]  sit here in an office building and shoot people all day. It's so manly. Meanwhile, you don't
[48:12.380 --> 48:19.020]  care about those Hodgies? Well, the New World Order doesn't care about you. And I know you're
[48:19.020 --> 48:20.260]  listening and laughing right now.
[48:20.260 --> 48:25.380]  You're 30 years old or whatever, or you're 25. And some of your buddies are kind of sick,
[48:25.380 --> 48:28.820]  but whatever. Yeah, that's what they signed up for. And the VA will take care of them.
[48:28.820 --> 48:31.380]  You don't know why your buddy's kidneys are failing or why there's blood coming out of
[48:31.380 --> 48:36.660]  his gums. Yeah, your buddies did just have a baby girl and her eyes are in the wrong
[48:36.660 --> 48:42.420]  spot and she's got holes in her heart and only got half a kidney.
[48:42.420 --> 48:47.060]  But you know what, so what? Shut up, Alex Jones, you're not patriotic. I know you don't
[48:47.060 --> 48:51.820]  care about anybody cuz you're a tough guy. But few years down the road, you're gonna
[48:51.820 --> 48:56.820]  go in and get diagnosed with that cancer when you're 35 or 40. And then they're gonna cut
[48:56.820 --> 48:59.660]  your chest open and go in there and remove one of your lungs.
[48:59.660 --> 49:04.020]  You get to have all that fun cuz it really gets the lungs. You guys are really looking
[49:04.020 --> 49:08.820]  forward to some lung cancer. Those little Hodgies got to die real quick. Of course,
[49:08.820 --> 49:12.620]  now they get to have all the deformed children and people make jokes about that. I've seen
[49:12.620 --> 49:15.500]  the websites that post the photos of the horribly deformed children.
[49:15.500 --> 49:19.540]  I see people making jokes about them going good, let the Hodgies die. Well, your kids
[49:19.540 --> 49:24.540]  are gonna be popping out like that too. And is that gonna be real cute and funny too?
[49:24.540 --> 49:29.780]  Cuz you see there's one rule in this universe. What comes around goes around. You reap what
[49:29.780 --> 49:33.620]  you sow. You can call it karma if you want, but I'm not talking about some next life.
[49:33.620 --> 49:39.740]  I'm talking about now. And I shake with fear, not of man, but the only thing I fear, God,
[49:39.740 --> 49:45.860]  the universe, justice. I get chills for you. I wouldn't be surprised if God didn't step
[49:45.860 --> 49:47.860]  on this whole country.
[49:47.860 --> 49:52.620]  This decadent, slovenly, 51 million aborted babies, delusional. I guess they deserve to
[49:52.620 --> 49:56.620]  die too. Are they Hodgies too? Everybody's dehumanized now, including our troops. I wouldn't
[49:56.620 --> 50:01.820]  be surprised if God didn't step on this whole country and crush me and my whole family in
[50:01.820 --> 50:07.500]  the process. I wouldn't slight God just because we're judged, just because I was standing
[50:07.500 --> 50:09.180]  next to people like you.
[50:09.180 --> 50:15.140]  Now you can always repent. We can always spiritually make the decision to say what we've all done
[50:15.140 --> 50:20.700]  collectively is wrong. But no, no, we're gonna wear black uniforms and skull hats and act
[50:20.700 --> 50:27.500]  real tough. And gee, I'm really good. I shot women. I'll do it again. They're savages.
[50:27.500 --> 50:32.420]  They like to scare people. I scared them. I like to scare people. It's weird. In his
[50:32.420 --> 50:36.880]  book he's like, I like to scare people. And he's on O'Reilly. He's like, I like to kill
[50:36.880 --> 50:44.380]  people who want to scare people.
[50:44.380 --> 50:47.580]  They're not shutting down any military, folks. They're getting ready for the next big terror
[50:47.580 --> 50:51.820]  attack so they can say, well, we were gonna cut the military, but now we can't. I've seen
[50:51.820 --> 51:00.660]  it scripted. It's a formula. It's all coming up. Stay with us.

[53:55.340 --> 54:07.280]  The choice is clear. Be unprepared or BePrepared.com. You know, our criminal government staged the
[54:07.280 --> 54:13.340]  Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam, killed 58,000 Americans, wounded over 300,000. They
[54:13.340 --> 54:17.500]  treated those vets like dog meat. I don't mean the hired hippies that were hired to
[54:17.500 --> 54:22.020]  spit on them to make people hate peace movements. I don't mean that's psyop. I mean the VA and
[54:22.020 --> 54:28.220]  the rest of them. And there's this whole culture of just saying you support the troops, but
[54:28.220 --> 54:30.740]  then feeding them into meat grinders.
[54:30.740 --> 54:34.740]  And now you're gonna have to deal with troops here at home. And let me tell you, I've had
[54:34.740 --> 54:38.140]  them in New York when I'm videotaping them across the street, run over, scream at me,
[54:38.140 --> 54:50.080]  cuss at me with firearms on their sides for no reason. And it's not the kind of military
[54:50.080 --> 54:53.540]  I've seen or what my family that's in the military looks like.
[54:53.540 --> 54:57.980]  They've got a special brand of dumbed down idiot that they're gonna have domestically
[54:57.980 --> 55:04.220]  here in the US. And then cops bugging their eyes out in black uniforms with machine guns
[55:04.220 --> 55:11.860]  looking all paranoid like any moment. A demon is gonna jump out of the bushes and eat them.
[55:11.860 --> 55:15.100]  And then they've got all these groups training the local police to just get ready for all
[55:15.100 --> 55:22.020]  Hades to break loose. And it probably is the system is gonna stage a bunch of terror attacks
[55:22.020 --> 55:26.460]  against their minions to get them all hyped up to have a war with the American people.
[55:26.460 --> 55:30.500]  That's what's being prepared. And I keep telling you this since I went to urban warfare drills
[55:30.500 --> 55:35.140]  more than 13, 14 years ago and witnessed them training to come to your house and take your
[55:35.140 --> 55:40.020]  guns. And you've now seen drills in Iowa just a few years ago of this.
[55:40.020 --> 55:44.360]  And you've seen them calling for troops on the streets in America. And then we've got
[55:44.360 --> 55:55.240]  this guy coming out demonizing Ventura and it turns out he's part of all of that training.
[55:55.240 --> 56:00.660]  Big brother in St. Louis schools plans to monitor student activity at home. Again, in
[56:00.660 --> 56:04.320]  Pennsylvania, it was the government itself that announced they're watching you at home
[56:04.320 --> 56:07.000]  on your laptops.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.880]  And then when people backlash, they said, we're not doing it. They had said they were
[56:10.880 --> 56:15.340]  doing it. But then in a psy-op with no respect for you, they said, I mean, we're not doing
[56:15.340 --> 56:18.900]  it. It's a conspiracy theory. Then it came out in court. Of course, they were including
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.180]  watching children in their showers.
[56:22.180 --> 56:25.260]  And now they're announcing big brother in St. Louis schools plans to monitor student
[56:25.260 --> 56:29.200]  activity at home. You wanna be part of our school? You're gonna wear a wristband that
[56:29.200 --> 56:33.660]  tracks your heart rate, everything. Elementary schools in Missouri plan to use rich watch
[56:33.660 --> 56:37.860]  like devices called polar active monitors to surveil children.
[56:37.860 --> 56:41.620]  Not only at school, but also at home. Parkway elementary schools get them while they're
[56:41.620 --> 56:47.500]  young. In St. Louis, plan to collect data about activity levels and even sleep patterns.
[56:47.500 --> 56:50.460]  For a week at a time, it will have the students wear the devices round the clock according
[56:50.460 --> 56:55.540]  to St. Louis Today.
[56:55.540 --> 56:59.460]  A pilot program began in April. Yeah, Department of Defense runs it in San Antonio. They got
[56:59.460 --> 57:04.480]  similar stuff. And AI computer cameras in the classrooms and in the school rooms that
[57:04.480 --> 57:11.580]  watch what you eat and what you say.
[57:11.580 --> 57:15.060]  And I'm getting footage sent everywhere of like telescreens going up in town squares,
[57:15.060 --> 57:19.700]  Walmarts, malls. And it's on the news and you walk in and there's big screens like in
[57:19.700 --> 57:27.240]  every every dystopic movie, Running Man, Equilibrium. I mean, every movie where it's a nightmare
[57:27.240 --> 57:30.940]  future there's big TV screen saying don't trust your neighbors on them.
[57:30.940 --> 57:36.020]  And now you walk in and they got jumbo screen saying don't watch your neighbors. And they've
[57:36.020 --> 57:41.260]  got the troops, the ones that are evil or dumb enough, all ready to wage war against
[57:41.260 --> 57:46.300]  us. And foreign governments training them, German, Dutch, Israeli. I mean, I've been
[57:46.300 --> 57:47.980]  to the urban drills, I've shown you.
[57:47.980 --> 57:53.740]  I've shown you, I mean, it's in the news. And I tell you, this country is just so in
[57:53.740 --> 57:59.420]  such trouble. And you watch a lot of the public's gonna line up behind these authoritarians
[57:59.420 --> 58:03.540]  when they stage this and salute the troops coming down the street, and they'll salute.
[58:03.540 --> 58:08.860]  I've heard them call for it. If I get arrested and taken away, they'll be like, good, arrest
[58:08.860 --> 58:13.420]  that traitor. I mean, I've heard him saying good, get rid of the posse commentatas, put
[58:13.420 --> 58:14.420]  troops on the streets.
[58:14.420 --> 58:20.540]  And I've heard him now, the good old boys are like, you know what? Go ahead, cuz I heard
[58:20.540 --> 58:24.300]  the right wingers are working with the Hodges. I'm like, but I thought you're right wing.
[58:24.300 --> 58:27.140]  They're like, shut up, we're gonna get you, we know you work with Al-Qaeda. And I'm like,
[58:27.140 --> 58:31.780]  no, no, I don't work with Al-Qaeda, the government does. We're gonna arrest you, buddy. We're
[58:31.780 --> 58:35.860]  patriots and you're not. And I mean, they're ready to turn this country over to pure evil.
[58:35.860 --> 58:37.820]  They wanna do it.
[58:37.820 --> 58:47.580]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:12.300]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:33.540]  There comes a time in any system when a dam breaks from water or an avalanche begins because
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:41.040]  of too much snow piling up or when you put a piece of paper onto a hot stove and then
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.460]  it finally browns and then reaches flashpoint at a certain Fahrenheit and flashes into flame.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:53.500]  Now in historical perspectives, a couple years is like a millisecond. And we are now entering
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:03.660]  the flashpoint where the paper ignites. Before the Constitution was browning and cracking,
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:09.580]  now it's caught on fire. And the dam broke, the tyranny's flooding in, and the government's
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.020]  like, yeah, we're gonna censor you.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:15.140]  We got spies on every street corners. We're face scanning you. We're putting passive MRIs
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.900]  in to brain scan you. We're gonna have checkpoints everywhere. Now we're setting the checkpoints
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.700]  up. We're gonna start censoring the Internet. We're gonna have machine guns. Yes, we're
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.940]  training your kids to spy on you.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.220]  Anyone could be a terrorist. I mean, there's PSAs now for kids where they're turning a
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.420]  family member and get $200. I mean, that's from 10 years ago in Road to Tyranny, but
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:43.220]  now there's new ones out. I mean, everything they were beta testing is now going mainstream.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:47.140]  Right as they implode the economy and give us fake numbers that we're in the best recovery
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.180]  ever, and everything's milk and honey.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.780]  Sorry, half those businesses you used to do business with are shut down, and most the
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.820]  restaurants you used to go to are shut down, and those factories are shut down. And sorry,
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:00.820]  your Social Security won't buy what it did before, but there's no inflation, though.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:06.540]  And just everything is wonderful. And Obama is announcing that he's gonna cut the military
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:12.020]  cuz we don't have money. And what they are cutting, and it's small cuts, 100 billion
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:19.060]  here, my gosh, that's huge. They got a trillion, 100 billion on budget, another 800 to 900
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.060]  trillion off budget, 800 to 900 billion off budget.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:29.120]  That's right at 2 trillion. You're gonna cut 100 billion, it's so massive. And the money
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.300]  they're cutting is just going to bail out the mega banks. It's just direct taxation
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:41.500]  to them. And they're saying we can no longer fight two wars simultaneously, total bull.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:47.100]  This was all planned. Meanwhile, they're using proxy wars against China and Russia, while
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.780]  the very same banking interests are building up China and Russia.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:55.180]  You're like, well, how does that work? They fund the Muslim extremist, they fund the Chinese
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.820]  communist. They fund the Russians to a great extent. They fund the more radical groups
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.820]  in Israel. That's like those TV ads demonizing Ron Paul where he says Israel founded Hamas.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.860]  I mean, they've had debates in the Knesset saying people ought to be arrested for doing
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.860]  it.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:19.580]  Whoever did it in the 70s, it was Mossad and Shin Bet. But that's Jerusalem Post, Herat's,
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.580]  Wall Street Journal, I showed it to you. But they're counting on you being ignorant. It's
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:30.800]  not America against the Muslims, or America against the Chinese, or it's not America against
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]  England.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.080]  When I criticize the corruption of the British Empire system and its control over the US
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.440]  to a great extent, I'm not saying the Brits are bad people. Same thing with Israel. It's
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:45.860]  not that the Israel runs the US or the US runs Israel, the same globalists run both.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:50.700]  The same globalists run China to a great extent. And you're like, well, then why are they trying
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.660]  to start these wars? Because the wars get everybody deeper in debt. And the Chinese
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:01.220]  can use wars or conflicts to crack down their public.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.420]  The Mulas won an attack at many levels because they believe they'll get more political power
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:14.160]  out of it in Iran. The name of the game is chaos because that gives criminal enterprise
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.680]  more control. Now I've got incredible, I've got to get to this economic news. I've got
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.040]  to get to the geopolitical news.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.660]  I've got to get to the lawless Obama regime. And all Rush Limbaugh, they're all freaking
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:33.280]  out over the fact that he is power grabbing and doing recess appointments nobody's ever
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.300]  done at this level. Because the Senate's not in recess, he didn't bring them forward then.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.900]  They're saying it's unconstitutional.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:47.740]  So is Obama launching Libya war without Congress? Yeah, that's the whole point. But you're also
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:54.740]  too busy talking bad about Ron Paul, who wants a declaration of war. And who, by the way,
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:05:00.980]  is not standing in the way of Israel going after Iran if they think it's in their interest.

[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:11.500]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Well everybody finds
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.820]  a mystery to be intriguing and that's why I probably spent so much time on it in the
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:21.780]  last hour when overall we have a lot bigger issues to deal with. My friend Jesse Ventura
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:27.580]  is out of the country, just drove into Mexico yesterday. That's brave in his RV and they
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:32.460]  can't get him on his wife's cell phone that doesn't work down there until he gets to Baja.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:38.900]  To respond to Bill O'Reilly Fox News, newspapers all over the country saying that the most
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:46.740]  lethal sniper Navy SEAL six years ago in 2006 sucker punched Jesse Ventura and then ran
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:53.020]  from him. I mean, that's so pathetic, it makes you want to believe it. But you can't believe
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.020]  that he said I'm glad Navy SEALs are being killed.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.460]  That's tailor made to make Ventura look bad. I know him well, his son knows him really
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.080]  well. When Tyrell saw that and I called him and told him about it yesterday, he couldn't
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.860]  believe it. The problem is he's in jury duty. He can't say what the trial is, but it's pretty
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.520]  important there in Minneapolis and so they're supposed to go at lunch right now. He's supposed
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.080]  to have called in, but his phone's off. They're still in the trial. I had to move Charlotte
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.640]  Iserby back 30 minutes with really important information on Skull and Bones and its tie
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.340]  in to how our entire education system was set up.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.340]  Of course, her father and grandfather were Skull and Bones. She was the head of policy
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:32.480]  department of education. She's gonna be joining us on that. By the way, I know you keep telling
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.720]  me, Jaren, that she sent us a transcript of the video we did with her. Will you ask Kurt
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.700]  to make sure he posts that right now or to see if that's been posted?
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:46.720]  Okay, great, something like a headline like Charlotte Iserby blows Skull and Bones wide
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.440]  open. That's a good transcript with the video report for everybody. I know it's been out
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:55.000]  for a month or so and has a few hundred thousand views, but first seen by prisonplanet.tv viewers,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.380]  but it's important.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.960]  And Charlotte's really proud of the hour long documentary we did for prisonplanet.tv. She
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.680]  thinks it's one of the best works out there. She's the lady that released the secret documents
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:09.080]  on Skull and Bones in the 80s to Anthony Sutton. She didn't want the credit, but that's what
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.880]  his best selling book, The Secret Establishment-
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.680]  It was a transcript of the first video we did about a year ago that I edited.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.240]  Okay, okay, so it's a transcript on education, not on the Skull and Bones.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.080]  Correct, but we could put them both out together.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.400]  Yeah, put them both out together. Yeah, put them both out together, that's good. And then
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.800]  we'll get her on. I don't know when we're gonna get Ty on because we may have to push
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.680]  her back even more cuz this is important on the Ventura deal.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.920]  I don't even know since this morning when I talk to him again if he's talked to him
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:41.040]  cuz I wanna know. I mean, Jesse, if he said it, he's all about saying what he thinks.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.320]  This stuff really happened. I've talked to folks that have called down to the Navy Seal
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.120]  bar, they said nobody knows about that. That would be well known, you wouldn't keep that
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.440]  secret at a big public event.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.600]  This supposedly happened. We're gonna find out because they're saying that he went to
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.640]  the bar and said, I'm glad Navy Seals are dying. And the guy punched him, knocked him
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:06.280]  down, and then the guy ran away from him. I mean, if that's true, I mean, the guy might
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280]  be telling the truth.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.720]  I don't wanna say he's a liar cuz I don't have proof of that, but it just doesn't make
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.840]  sense. But the part about saying I'm glad Navy Seals are dead, that has psi-op written
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:21.400]  all over it. Then we looked into this guy, turns out he's training police to fight domestic
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:29.800]  extremist and setting up kind of a Halliburton style diplomatic protection group.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:35.160]  Man is rolling out a book he's selling right now. So I wanted to get Ty's take on that,
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:41.520]  but his phone is still turned off and can't get out of the courtroom, obviously. So we'll
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.600]  see what happens, but I cannot wait to get Ventura on as soon as we're able to get in
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.400]  touch with him when he gets to the Baja on the next day or two.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.280]  But I remember Ventura telling me off air and on air last week, well, that was a few
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.460]  weeks ago he was on about the disinformation. When they claimed he was road raging and tailgating
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.000]  and the cops pulled him over cuz he had to go catch his commercial flight. And I'm like,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  this happened yesterday?
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.200]  And he goes, yeah, we talked yesterday, you called me in Minnesota. He goes, the point
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.360]  is I got my lawyer on this. They say I'm out road raging and just making it up on TMZ and
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:22.920]  Fox News. And TMZ removed it, Fox News removed it, not really a retraction. So road raging
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.300]  two weeks ago, not true.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:29.220]  Now he says he's glad Navy Seals are dead and is getting knocked to the floor at a Navy
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:36.080]  Seal bar when Jesse doesn't drink for decades. And I can have a testament to that. But I
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.540]  told you, they did this to us and We Are Change. They involved me in the articles as well,
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.900]  the New York Post, the same crew doing this now.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.640]  Rupert Murdoch, who's known for running wire tapping and dirty tricks and running police
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.680]  and you name it. And that's the system's blackmail on him now to endorse Obama cuz he's got the
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.240]  fast and furious on them. That's part of the power structure kind of blackmailing each
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.840]  other. But they don't like We Are Change. They just have people with a young girl in
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.480]  a wheelchair, ram them into We Are Change people and then charge them with assault.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.560]  And then the Secret Service gets on the stand and says actually, he didn't assault them,
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:15.960]  they ran into him on purpose. But they had the headline truther attacks disabled girl
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:22.400]  in wheelchair. Now the headlines are truther Ventura knocked out by hero seal.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.600]  Right when they knew Ventura was driving into Mexico. And it said publicly people can't
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.480]  get a hold of until he gets to Baja, which is an hour from pavement and doesn't have
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:36.880]  telephone as well. So Jesse Ventura leaves the country. His phones are tapped. He's been
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.820]  visited by the CIA before. And boom, right as he drives off, the guy pops up that's training
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:50.000]  our police to deal with domestic extremists and is part of this group set up by Richard
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.440]  Pearl and Dick Cheney National Security Affairs Institute.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.080]  And well, he's gonna help train our police to fight the domestic extremist. By the way,
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:10.760]  I'm gonna try to get this Chris Kyle on the show. Just incredible. But again, as soon
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:19.840]  as Tyrell is able to get out of there, we'll get him on. Or we'll just get Charlotte on
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.140]  and then when he calls in we'll show a brief report and continue there.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.680]  Some of the other news I wanna get to, I wanna analyze the way they make it a joke, but at
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:38.340]  least they are covering it. And that is Comedy Central, I meant to play yesterday but I didn't
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.760]  coming out about the NDAA and that it allows the secret arrest of citizens and for citizens
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  to disappear into dungeons.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.920]  And now this is the essence of tyranny, the essence of corruption. And then we just have
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.900]  all these articles coming out now, it's not just Florida, DHS officers armed with semi-automatic
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:04.520]  set up unannounced ID checkpoint. We're gonna be getting into more of that, but the martial
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.440]  law rollout is happening.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.880]  But as Jesse Ventura vindicated by warning about military on the streets, as Ron Paul
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:16.960]  and I know, we're demonized for talking about what's now happening. And now shifting gears
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.980]  to filmmaker, director, TV producer, Tyrell Ventura, son of Jesse Ventura, the only guy
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:30.000]  in the US, his mom and dad, obviously ties here in the United States.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.480]  Jesse went into Mexico yesterday and he hasn't been able to raise him yet, at least since
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.720]  this morning. He just got out of jury duty. Have you been able to talk to your dad? Have
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:46.120]  you found anything out yet? And what's your take on what this gentleman, who has a book
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.440]  that came out two days ago, is saying about your father, Tyrell?
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:57.680]  No, I have not been able to talk to my father at all. Like I said, he's traveling in Mexico
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.240]  right now and there's obviously no cell phone, cell phones don't work in the desert and things
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.920]  like that. So I have not been able to get ahold of him to ask him about the accusations
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:14.560]  and the incident that this guy is referring to. Obviously, I have the utmost respect for
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:19.280]  this man's service record and things like that. I want to be clear that I don't know
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:24.960]  anything about the story that he's talking about. I've never heard anything about that.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:32.000]  It certainly doesn't, I've never ever heard my father ever make any kind of remark about
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.920]  wishing American soldiers dead. I have never heard him ever say anything in that nature.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.680]  So it does sound pretty ludicrous to me.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.880]  Well, also I did some research. He was there at that Navy Seal Bar, reportedly with hundreds
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.640]  of people in it. It's a big place there on the beach. In 2006, he was speaking to a Buds
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.400]  class and I saw people commenting on the different seal sites and stuff saying they were there
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.640]  the whole day and that this never happened. And that even if they weren't there, this
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.000]  would have been talked about, this would have been known. And there's people posting photos
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.760]  they took with your dad there that day, that was when he had the Johnny Depp pirate beard
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.760]  and everything.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.600]  Yeah, I mean, it would be pretty shocking to me that if somebody were to assault my
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:26.560]  father in a bar that we wouldn't have heard about it sooner than, however many, six to
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:33.840]  seven years later. It seems pretty wild that an incident like that would go down the way
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:41.440]  he said that we wouldn't have heard about it in 2006 or 2007. It seems weird that it's
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.040]  something of a violent nature the way he's describing.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.120]  By the way, I met your father for the first time one week after when this incident happened
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.480]  because that's when they were there for a Congressional Medal of Honor winner seal who
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.800]  died in Iraq. I met your father one week after this event and I did an interview with him.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:03.480]  And it's on video, I can testify there was not a mark on his face and he was probably
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480]  in the best shape he's been in a while.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.640]  That's probably how he blew his hip, he'd been running every day. He was very thin and
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:15.480]  good shape, tan, in the interview, no bruises, no nothing one week after this incident.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.960]  I never heard about it. Like I said, I haven't been able to talk to dad directly or anything
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:25.520]  like that. So I don't know what his take is on this yet. All I can say is that I've never
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.360]  heard of it before. It's my best recollection. I'm pretty sure that if my dad was punched
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.680]  in a bar, I would have heard about it in a packed bar. I'm pretty sure I would have heard
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:44.400]  about that, but obviously it's well documented, his feelings about the Iraq war and our involvement
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.360]  and that obviously it's well documented about his feelings about President Bush and Vice
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.640]  President Cheney.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.920]  So that side of the conversation that this guy supposedly heard, you know, I can say,
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.080]  yeah, I mean, I've heard him not in that particular incident, but I have heard my dad's feelings
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.640]  on that as opposed to my dad ever saying anything about wishing American soldiers dead or saying
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.720]  they deserve to die or anything of that nature. It does not sound like my dad and that it
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.400]  doesn't sound like anything he'd say.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.200]  Well, I have seen him when seals have been killed. I talked to him privately. He was
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:25.320]  very upset with the camaraderie and everything. He doesn't want the war. He doesn't want anyone
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.560]  getting killed. He doesn't want soldiers getting killed. He doesn't want civilians getting
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.640]  killed. He doesn't want anyone getting killed. And so it was like I said, it doesn't sound
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640]  like him.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.200]  Well, he's always so respectful of military people in airports and stuff. He always thinks
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.160]  of their service and says, I hope we can get you guys home and out of harm's way. And he's
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.720]  worried about DU. And I've seen him when the SEAL's helicopter blew up, the mysterious
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:54.080]  SEAL team six situation. He was upset when I talked to him privately.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:57.540]  And I mean, just imagine, here's their family. Please stop. It sounds like it's scripted
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:04.440]  to make him look bad. Here's the family. Jesse, Governor, please stop talking bad about the
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.920]  SEALs. No, I'm glad they're dead. I mean, that is just, I do not believe that.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:15.280]  It's still out of character of him that I can't, I can't imagine that that's what happened.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.440]  Like I said, I haven't talked to him, so I have no idea, but it just seems still out
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:24.080]  of character for him to wish harm upon his fellow SEAL team members. It doesn't make
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080]  any sense.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:30.480]  Now, it's interesting. This guy's got a book out right now. And I mean that he would announce
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.160]  this now that the book came out and that he would say that he punched him and knocked
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.540]  him down, but not out. And that he then ran away and that the SEALs teach him to punch
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:43.280]  and run away. I mean, that sounds like a joke.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.760]  I, I, I, you know, I, like I said, I don't, I don't know much about the guy himself. Obviously
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:54.240]  the veteran, you know, I don't, it doesn't, I mean, you know, I, I don't, like I said,
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:59.240]  I mean, that's part of the, what he's described doesn't make any sense to me at all, you know?
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:04.240]  So I don't know, you know, reportedly some of your dad's terms of talking about like
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.400]  whether they'll get trained to punch and run away or not. I, I, I, I, I'm not a Navy SEAL.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400]  I don't know.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.600]  That's ridiculous. Well, sure. You obviously throw a hand grenade and run away. But the
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.880]  point is, look, look, look, look, what is, you know, your dad probably better than anybody.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.720]  You, you, you've worked with him as an assistant and then as a director, but your own films
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.720]  you've made separate from that.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:27.540]  You know, you're a producer on the TV show, everything great, great cinematographer, everything.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.960]  You work with your dad constantly and you, and, and you, I know you don't probably want
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:34.640]  to repeat what you told me last night, but you know, your words were, this is pure BS.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.000]  After you saw the first video and correct me if I'm wrong, but then you went on to say,
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.560]  I'm not looking forward to telling my dad about this.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.160]  Well, of course not. My dad never likes to hear people speaking ill of him. I mean, nobody
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.920]  does, you know, I mean, I, I, I, you know, he just is getting down to Mexico. He's, you
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.920]  know, going to kind of recharge, you know, you hate to deliver bad news like this, but
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:02.400]  you know, somebody's saying, you know, negative things about you and a really, you know, saying
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.080]  that you were involved in a violent altercation and that, you know, you were wishing harm
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.080]  to the serviceman.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.120]  You know, he doesn't want to hear that. And I know that that really upsets him when he
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.120]  hears things like that.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.520]  Doesn't this sound like about the mask?
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.000]  When he hears things that are potentially false, you know, he doesn't like it when people
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.360]  speak falsely about him.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.360]  Now, now it could be like we talked last night, maybe part of it's true. Maybe they did get
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.640]  in an argument. Maybe, I mean, I mean that part perhaps could be true. We don't know
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.640]  because Jesse Ventura's out.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.240]  I don't know. I haven't talked to him, so I don't know. But I mean, yeah, I mean, my
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.080]  dad is not afraid to voice his opinions about current events and things like that.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:42.760]  But there's no way he would say, especially in front of a family, I think seals deserve
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.760]  to die. I mean, that is clear, both.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.920]  It doesn't, it doesn't sound like him at all. And, and, and, you know, that does not sound
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:49.920]  like my father.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:56.840]  Yeah. So, but again, I haven't talked to him directly, but I don't, you know, I don't
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:01.400]  even know, you know, I mean, as soon as I did word about, you know, from him, you know,
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.560]  regarding what this guy's saying, you know, obviously I'll, I'll know more about it then.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.920]  But I mean, as of right now, like I, it just doesn't sound like his character doesn't sound
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.920]  like him.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.440]  Well, Ty, we appreciate you taking time out of jury duty right now to do this. And then
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.720]  the few minutes you've got for lunch, we only got about five minutes left here with you.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:23.160]  But, but, but obviously this is now on the heels of two weeks ago. I just so happen only
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:28.120]  talked to him like every few weeks to talk to your dad, you know, about coming on before
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120]  he left town.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.280]  And he said, yeah, call me next week. I'm talking to him in Minnesota. I call your Minnesota
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:40.200]  number. I talked to him. Then the next day it's on the news that I hadn't even seen it
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:46.120]  yet that he's road raging. He calls into the show to say, I'm here in Minnesota. They didn't
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.680]  really retract it. They just removed it. He said, I hope this isn't a dirty trick. And
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:54.120]  now we see this happening right when he goes into Mexico, that is kind of creepy.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:58.520]  It is a strange coincidence, but, but, but, you know, the moment that he's out of the
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:04.080]  country and is unable to directly respond on the same day, you know, does, does, is,
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.280]  is a creepy coincidence. You know, I don't know. I mean, the guy's out promoting a book.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:14.600]  You know, I saw the, the, the interview with O.P. and Anthony, you know, apparently some
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.320]  caller called in to ask about it, which, you know, okay. That's, that's, you know, that's
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:23.880]  on their word. I don't know. Maybe they, somebody did, maybe someone did it. Who knows? I know
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.960]  it looks staged. You agree with my analysis? Oh, I mean, I, I, I wouldn't say that, but
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:34.000]  it definitely, you know, it smells of, of, of PR. It smells of publicity. You know, it
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.200]  smells of, of, of, you know, publicity. You know, he also makes fun of your dad and calls
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.320]  him a geriatric. I mean, your dad's in pretty darn good shape. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's,
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.080]  you know, it's, it's, you know, I can't speak for him. I don't know what's in his head,
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.840]  but I do know that, you know, obviously he probably disagrees with my father's opinion
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.120]  on the war and opinions on Bush and Cheney and, and, you know, that probably upsets him.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.280]  But I, you know, it sounds like it does. Well, let me fill you in on the guy. Of course,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:08.180]  the most famous Turkey shoot is Fallujah and he brags about shooting a woman and he calls
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:14.480]  them savages. And it's pretty incendiary. He's from right here in Texas. He's a good
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.600]  old boy, but rodeo bronc, you know, get rider, you know, chip off the old block as they'd
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.600]  say.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.040]  Seems like a nice guy at many levels, but doesn't seem like he's super intellectual
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:31.720]  or that smart compared to some of the seals I know. And he's sitting there. He has a mercenary
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:37.680]  firm out of North Texas that prepares local police to fight insurgents in America. That's
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.600]  the whole rollout we see happening. And he advises the US military and is involved with
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.000]  some Israeli groups that advise US military.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.180]  And he's, he's, he's been given awards by a group and works with a group created by
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:26:00.440]  Richard Pearl and Dick Cheney. So this guy's pretty, what's that sound like? He's a pretty
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:06.480]  connected guy. You know, like I said, I don't know much about him. I've been kind of on
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.400]  jury duty, so I haven't been able to really follow up extensively with, with who he is
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.400]  and things like that.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.160]  You know, trying to get the rest so I can be a good juror.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.320]  If this turns out to not be true and, and, or parts of it, large parts of it aren't,
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.480]  I mean, your dad is not going to just probably lay down and take it.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.960]  I can't imagine that, but I can't imagine he would, he wouldn't lay down and take it,
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.640]  but I don't know. I'm not him, you know, but I, you know, I, I, if this is untrue, which
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:40.520]  it really smells like it is, you know, I'm sure my, my dad will speak, you know, I don't
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.520]  know. I mean, it's up to him.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.560]  Well, he's the only person ever beat Vince McMahon in a lawsuit. He didn't meet the TSA,
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.440]  but, but he sure tried. They just wouldn't give him a trial. So yeah, I know your dad's
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.760]  not litigious, but he's not going to lay down and take this if it's, if it's, I, I, I can't
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.880]  imagine that, you know, I, like I said, I don't want to speak for him because I haven't,
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:04.480]  I haven't been able to talk directly for him and I'm not him. If it was me and I was in
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:10.040]  a situation where someone were to, you know, make up something completely false and then
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:16.680]  say that I believed in the killing of us soldiers, if it was me, I would, if, and if I was able
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:22.000]  to bring a defamation lawsuit or something like that, of course I would, you know, but
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  that's me.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.960]  I'm not my dad. Well, this guy's certainly making himself a big name and I guess he'll
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.720]  get some big government contracts out of it and maybe some big guys told him to go with
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.120]  it or maybe part of it's true or he, or seven years later, six years later, his memory's
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.600]  not clear, but I mean, I just know your dad pretty darn good. You know him a lot better
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:44.160]  than I do obviously. And I've seen him talking to troops, getting tears in his eyes and talking
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.200]  how much he, how much he hates troops dying and the Navy seals and the Navy and how that's
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.080]  the very, that's the very reason that he, he disliked the war is that he doesn't want
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:59.640]  to see soldiers or innocent civilians getting killed for, for a war based on lies and, and,
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.600]  and, and, you know, he doesn't, that's why he's against it in the first place. He doesn't
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.320]  want to see people getting killed for, for no good reason. So that's what I mean. It
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.840]  makes no logical sense to me that he would wish death upon service men when his whole
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.680]  stance against the war is that he doesn't want to see service men or civilians getting
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.680]  killed.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.800]  So basically we can conceive exactly that your dad may have been sucker punched and
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.760]  this guy ran off, which he says he did, which is really weird.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.480]  I really doubt he was even sucker punched. I don't know. Like I said, I think I would
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.880]  have heard about exactly, but that could be in the realm of possibility, like a Loch Ness
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.560]  monster, but, but, but that he would say, I, you know, troops need to die. I like it
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.320]  when us troops die. That's in the realm of Easter bunnies.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:50.800]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I never, I could never see my dad saying that or even remotely if
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.800]  he's, I, I can't even see him saying it sarcastically, but once again, I won't, I don't, I don't
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.360]  know until I talk to him directly.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.840]  Well, and I know you didn't even want to come on and speak for him, but then you changed
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.080]  your mind and said, well, I guess if I can't get ahold of him, somebody's got to respond.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.720]  I hope the media doing this hit job will at least look at what you've said. And obviously
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.720]  he called here a few weeks ago on the last fake piece of news that was proven fake.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  So, uh, the, the, the line is tie. You call me anytime I can assure you, Alex, that the
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:22.440]  moment that I get word from him on what to do, and if that, if that involves, uh, you
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.280]  know, talking to you again, there's something of that nature, whatever we decide, uh, you
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.040]  will, I will let you go. I'll drive into the studio anytime at midnight, you know, six
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.720]  in the morning, whenever he wants to tape an interview or do it live, we're here, Tyrel
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.960]  Ventura, get back to Jerry duty and get some lunch. I'll call you this evening, bro.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.360]  All right. Take care of yourself. Great work. All right. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Yeah. I thought
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.360]  this might be true until I learned he's hooked up with Dick Cheney and Richard Pearl known
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:52.120]  as the Prince of darkness, by the way, at the Pentagon, we're on the March, the empire's
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:30:02.720]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Did you ever think you'd be where you are

[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.360]  consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.880]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:16.760]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true total government control
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:22.120]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:27.120]  the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.840]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:36.240]  kids. Every year 1000s of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:41.240]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of

[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:09.520]  silver lungs generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.820]  the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:19.440]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:24.700]  The silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:31.560]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:37.200]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:42.800]  colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator. Very easy to follow step by step instructions
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:50.120]  are provided making production fast and simple. Go to www dot silver lungs.com today and learn

[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:20.880]  I'm done talking about the Ventura mystery
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:28.240]  we hear from Jesse, but we've covered it in detail today. Probably spent 30 minutes total
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.160]  in the last hour and a half on it or more because it just gets into psyops and it gets
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:37.000]  into the type of things they'll do. I mean, take Jesse Ventura. They knew he was major
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:46.160]  political material back when he was more mainstream before he fully woke up in 2000.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:56.000]  So they come to him in 2001, 2002. They come to him in 2002. They give him a big contract,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.680]  close to $10 million, 9 million plus for a three year contract to host primetime show
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:10.720]  on MSNBC back when they actually had viewers. And then the war starts and he says, no, I'm
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:16.680]  not going to be pro war. And they say, okay, you can keep the money, but you're barred
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.840]  from even giving it back.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:24.760]  We'll sue you if you even try to give it back. And he said, no, I keep contracts. They say
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:33.720]  no media interviews of any type. Look at your contract. And so for three years until 2006,
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:40.960]  he's gone. They paid him close to $10 million. And later he was told by folks, they you were
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.680]  approached MSNBC gets government money, which we now know from banker bailouts and things
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.680]  that have come out.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:52.440]  But back then this was wild to hear. And the government actually wanted you tied down and
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:58.160]  you would have had the job and been this big TV guy. If you would have played ball, but
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.920]  if not, they were just gonna shut you down and they had you profiled. And so that was
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.000]  the plan all along.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.160]  So they paid him nine plus million dollars. He's now talked about this since. Actually
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.080]  broke it a few years ago here on my show. And that all of this went on. So now they're
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.540]  getting ready to launch an Iran war. They know Jesse Ventura's floating around thinking
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.120]  about coming back.
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.360]  If there was an attack on Iran, he was thinking about getting involved in the political process,
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.560]  at least giving speeches or whatever. That at least was being looked at, I can tell you.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.800]  He was thinking about running for president. There was some other talk, I'm not gonna get
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:37.240]  into. But the point is, is that he's got major name recognition and that's what's valuable
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.240]  in politics.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:46.600]  So he is this commodity. And so this smells completely of shy up the way it was deployed,
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:51.440]  the way it was put out, the way it was done, the way it was said. Just the whole thing.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.480]  I mean, it's like when you walk into a clothing shop, I'm not even a clothes horse and know
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.480]  that much about it.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.400]  But I've learned enough to know the cut of a fine suit or an Armani. Don't have an Armani
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.280]  suit, but I've learned what they look like. From movies and TV and I've been in stores,
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.000]  I've seen them. I'm like, are those Armanis? Yeah, those are Armanis. About two years ago,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.560]  I was at Nordstrom's buying some shoes.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.680]  I says, are those Armani suits? Yeah, how'd you know? I see that cut. With this, it's
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.040]  a lot more obvious like a yellow Volkswagen drives by or a red fire truck. That's a red
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.600]  fire truck. I mean, you know a PR rollout when you see one. And a book comes out, all
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:31.480]  this is done and it just shows you that as soon as I investigated the guy, and he may
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.560]  be dumb and being handled, being manipulated, and part of it's true and they got him to
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.560]  spin it.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.760]  But part of psyoping and moving to the next level out of the military is doing bad things.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:47.120]  And I don't know that's the case yet. The guy conceivably could be telling the truth.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:54.560]  Tyrell says he doesn't think so and I tend to agree with him. It just shows you what
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:00.240]  they're capable of. So if they ever do stuff like this to me, I'm walking down the street
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:05.000]  and they jump out with a quadriplegic kid in a wheelchair and say I assault them like
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.600]  they did our reporters up in New York and it turned out it was staged.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:17.320]  With again, News Corp and the New York Post. And it came out in court, it was staged.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.720]  The Secret Service wouldn't lie. I mean, they could do any of this to us folks, so we just
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.600]  need to remember. You asked Ron Paul, that was the point I wanted to make before we go
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.600]  to Charlotte.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.560]  You're trying with Ron Paul. One of my reporters just ran in, I've got to learn more later,
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.480]  but reportedly they're putting ads out now claiming they're Ron Paul ads. But they aren't
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:44.480]  his Ron Paul ads saying bad things about Asians and blacks and people. So I've got to learn
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:45.480]  about this dirty trick.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.980]  I mean, it's gonna get crazy. By the way, we told you about this two days ago. It's
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:58.800]  now in the news. In fact, I had it here in my stack. They're admitting on NPR and they're
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:08.640]  admitting on other mainline newspapers that Romney was given votes that were not his.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.240]  And it's the same thing with Huntsman. I've got a whole stack on that. I mean, there's
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.240]  a certain point where you can't even keep track of this anymore.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.440]  They're supposed to call in at all these precincts. And now it turns out in a whole bunch of them,
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.320]  it's been confirmed. We don't know how many though, but it's been confirmed in a bunch
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.160]  of them. We know the precincts that they told them just put it in a truck and drive it to
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.200]  this other location to have them counted.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:36.240]  And then we'll call that in. And then trucks didn't make it. And then they had gentlemen's
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.720]  agreements. We played that clip from Fox News with Karl Rove deciding to give, what, six
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:49.120]  more points to Huntsman, clearly making him beat Ron Paul. I mean, it's just confirmed.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:59.800]  But it's too sophisticated for the general public. Yeah, that was Santorum. At a certain
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.620]  point, I can't even keep track of it anymore. This is what these people do. They just swarm
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.620]  me with this info.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:08.400]  And they know the public's halfway paying attention. People on the street go, I've seen
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:14.520]  you on TV with Hulk Hogan on that conspiracy show. And I go, it's Jesse Ventura's conspiracy
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:20.960]  theory. That's Jesse Ventura. That was back when one of my neighbors was a bank manager,
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.960]  pretty smart guy.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.460]  And I'm like, no, and he was arguing with me. He goes, no, you got a show with Hulk
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:31.120]  Hogan. I'm like, no, man, I don't have a show with Hulk Hogan. It's the same thing. I know
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:41.660]  many people down the road. That's that Hulk Hogan guy got punched out by a Navy SEAL.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:47.680]  It just never ends how they count on people not paying attention and how they manipulate
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:54.720]  you. Now, I'm very excited to have Charlotte Iserby on with us till about 40 after next
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.360]  hour, so we'll have her for more than an hour. Here with us today, we put out a documentary
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.400]  that's free to the public.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.800]  We've got it linked up today at infoawars.com. Charlotte Iserby blows Skull and Bones wide
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.000]  open. She originally did it decades ago, but didn't want the credit, giving an investigative
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  reporter, well, formerly top congressional researcher, Anthony Sutton, the material
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.880]  to put out his books on the Skull and Bones, which were the definitive tomes. But I've
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:32.400]  got her on today to Nexus, I probably should have told her this ahead of time, but just
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:38.320]  to recap before she gets more into education, the history of Skull and Bones setting up
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.920]  modern education in Europe, in Germany, here in the US, and those connections.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.560]  And of course, she knows about Skull and Bones cuz her father and grandfather were, and she
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.600]  has a lot of the internal documents, and has one of their official grandfather clocks,
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.440]  and a lot of information she showed us that was put out for the first time. A lot of it
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.720]  was not put out for the first time, but was integrated together for the first time as
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.720]  well.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.520]  So as a public service, we of course, to understand the secret establishment, understand what
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.600]  we're up against, put that out to the public. PrisonPlanet.tv viewers of course saw it first.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:15.640]  Her original Dallas phone book size book is no longer in print, but it's free on her website
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.960]  graciously, because she wants to stop these tyrants.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.480]  But I convinced her, I don't know, six, seven months ago, and others did, I said, why don't
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.060]  you come out? I know you said you weren't gonna print it again, you don't wanna mess
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.600]  with it, you're retired, and wanna travel the world and things, you've done your service.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:34.560]  But why don't you just reprint it again, people want it. And she said, no, it's free on the
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.560]  website.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.960]  And then I said, well, you've got all these new articles you've written, why don't you
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.280]  put those together in a book? She said, you know what I'll do? I'll just kinda update,
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.720]  revise in a bridge, my big phone book size one, and put out the deliberate dumbing down
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.080]  of America revised abridged edition Charlotte Thompson Iserby.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:59.320]  And so this is now available at infowars.com. We've got a treasure trove of them, and I
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.240]  hope that you order them because once these run out, we don't know if she'll ever even
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.520]  reprint them. Because again, the question is, does she wanna deal with that? She may
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.900]  have just put it out for free again.
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:11.860]  But if you want a hard copy of this new version of deliberate dumbing down full of all the
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:16.460]  documents and all the incredible proof of the plan to dumb down our children and turn
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:20.600]  us into basically servile animals that are incapable of thought. As Bertrand Russell
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:26.380]  said, they'll dumb us down with diet injections and injunctions and education to the point
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:33.340]  of it'll be like sheep revolting against the process and the fashion of eating.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:40.600]  It would be like sheep revolting against the practice of eating mutton. I sound a bit out
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:47.400]  of it today, sometimes can't recall things quite as well. I cracked some ribs and separated
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:54.080]  some ribs, dropping a weight on myself in a weightlifting accident last weekend, so
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:55.320]  I'm a little bit out of it.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:00.480]  Not on painkillers, painkillers make me nauseous. I am on about 10 Advil today so far, but I'm
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:06.460]  just a little bit out of it, so bear with me today. Okay, so joining us is Charlotte
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:12.760]  Iserby to break down this information. Charlotte, it is wonderful to have you here. I wanna
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.520]  go to the beginning, briefly, Skull and Bones, the tie-in, and then what the plan was, what
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.960]  you discovered in the 80s as the head of policy, number two position, Department of Education,
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.040]  you're whistleblowing.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:27.760]  And now what's currently happening with education and your warning for the public, but we salute
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.600]  you for your work and thank you for reissuing a new book. Thank you so much.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:37.920]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thank you all your audience for your support through the years.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:43.320]  I think the best place for people to go is, and you have that PDF, I believe up on your
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:50.080]  website now, at least I asked for that. It's a PDF and it's called America's Road to Ruin.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:55.640]  And there were two marvelous gals, researchers that I respect highly, very involved in the
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:01.600]  extraordinary research all of us have done on this, who heard that first video that was
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:08.000]  filmed on the river here, saw it, Alex's video, that those guys did a good job on, and it
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.160]  was in regard to education. But it really dealt with everything, right? It didn't deal
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:19.400]  so much with the order, and I will deal with that within about two minutes, but it dealt
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:28.040]  with my whole life since I went abroad when I was 21 years old. And it's beautifully done.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:34.440]  It's a transcript. The gals transcribed that video, Alex. And then one of our most talented
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:41.160]  people, Deborah Niwa, who's in publishing and graphics and all, put it all together,
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:48.240]  even has a picture of my little dog in it and my husband and me, as a PDF. So your listeners
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.800]  can click on that and they can read that. It's 16 pages. That's the video that your
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:59.160]  great guys did when they were up here, the first one. And then the second one was on
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.240]  the order. And I don't know what, that has not been transcribed, but I hope people will
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:09.840]  go and look at it because it has had a maximum number of hits. These have been very good
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.280]  videos. And by the way, I just think your guys are great. You have a tremendously capable
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:22.640]  staff there creating these videos. But I found out something about the order. It's great.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.280]  I found out more about the order since you got onto it and actually since Anthony Sutton
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:34.280]  got onto it than I ever knew before because obviously, as George Bush would say, it's
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:40.320]  a secret. So I can't talk about it. I mean, I don't know anything about it, basically,
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.040]  because it was a secret and my father and grandfather couldn't talk about it, but I
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:53.880]  didn't know all their friends. And that really helped out a great deal. There's a very interesting
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:01.920]  chapter in Chris Milligan's book on the order. What's it called? Flushing Out Skull and Bones.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.320]  That book has not been reprinted, but it's a wonderful book, Flushing Out Skull and Bones.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:11.760]  Chris Milligan knew Anthony Sutton too. I did a chapter in there that's quite interesting.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:16.440]  If anybody wants to go, I think you may be able to find that on the internet about my
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:22.480]  family's connections as well. Now, when I asked for the last interview that we did on
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:30.480]  this, I thought, you know, I was looking through some of my old files and I found a very interesting
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:36.160]  article from one of the little patriotic newsletters that we managed to get around the country
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:44.680]  in regard to Harold Howe and how he was responsible under Lyndon Johnson for all the major changes
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:51.400]  in education using, of course, the minorities to bring about the destruction of our education
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:57.760]  system that we're looking at today with consolidation, getting rid of little schools and all this.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.960]  Remember way back in the 60s, they said it was because they wanted the minorities to
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:06.080]  have a better education. That wasn't it at all. Harold Howe came out and said with this
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:13.280]  integration, he was going to totally turn the education system on its head. And so they
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.240]  put in my thing and they did all this data here. My little head is going, I'm thinking,
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.880]  Harold Howe, you know what? I'm going to go take a look in one of those.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:25.040]  Well, Charlotte, listen, I want you to get into that. But for you to say I know nothing
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:30.520]  about it and giggle, you gave Anthony Sutton the documents, the materials, the role list,
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:38.560]  the information when nothing was known. Your father, his father were Skull and Bones. And
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:44.160]  I mean, you do know a lot. Your son knows a ton, a lot of ground.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.120]  We know a lot, but listen, Alex, what I want people to know is this is so important. And
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:55.960]  you interrupted me, okay? Harold Howe, I looked him up. You want to hear what he was and Skull
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:03.200]  and Bones? He's Skull and Bones. Now, I'm going to say this convinces me that the order
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:07.720]  at Yale, and I didn't really have to be too much convinced, but when I found this out,
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:14.160]  I'm convinced that the order at Yale of Skull and Bones is responsible for the complete
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:21.120]  transformation of American education to workforce training, to considering our children as nothing
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:29.920]  but animals, which was the philosophy of Wilhelm Wundt in life's sake, who trained all the
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:37.880]  American educators, starting with Hall, going over in the mid-1800s, trained them in how
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:45.320]  to not educate, but to train our children as animals using Pavlovian method Skinner.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:53.440]  I know that's true. I'm absolutely convinced. And when I read that, I'm going to read, Harold
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:49:00.320]  Howe, 1940, Skull and Bones. This is on page 128 of one of those little black books. It
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:08.320]  says here, education, born August 17, 1918, Hartford, Connecticut, Vice President for
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:15.320]  Education and Research, Ford Foundation, and the address, residents, very fancy, always
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:22.320]  these guys, East Side of New York City, Yale Corporation, elected members, successor trustee,
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:28.320]  principal, Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, 53 to 57 goes on, Newton Junior College, etc.,
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.320]  2,500 schools, Scarsdale, New York, Director of Learning Institute of North Carolina, Trustee
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:42.320]  College Entrance Exam Board, U.S. Commissioner of Education, 1965 to 68. That's when the
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  damage was done, if you recall, folks. The damage was-
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.320]  Now, most people aren't experts on education like you are.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:57.320]  Well, that's when the total upheaval, putting outcomes, performance-based education, elementary
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.320]  and secondary education- That's when dog training came in. And so that's why this is so key.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:06.320]  That is when the dog training came in, they changed from teaching the teachers, teaching
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.320]  students history, math, science, and all, what they know in their head, to what they
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:18.320]  can do, performance. Then they retrained all the teachers as little psychiatrists after
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:26.320]  1965, which was Woodbrock Chisholm, the Canadian psychiatrist, good friend of Alger Hiss,
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.320]  called for getting rid of the conscience. And if you're going to get rid of the conscience,
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:34.320]  you have to use psychiatry. And the reason they want to get rid of the conscience was,
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.320]  now let's get into the war business.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.320]  Stay there, we're going to come right back. But again, you're perfectly suited to discover

[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:55.320]  hiding in plain view that that was their real secret power, and you trace it right back
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.320]  to the German mind control engineers they used on the Hessian mercenaries.

[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:33.320]  You wonder why people can't think. You wonder why they seem to be so dumbed down. You wonder
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:38.320]  why they giggle at you when you talk about a new world order because they've been Pavlovian
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.320]  conditioned that it's cute and funny and the info babe laughs on Fox News when they talk
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:48.320]  about it. So they're winners psychologically when they're losers. And then there's the
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:53.320]  chemicals in the water, everything else. But German scientists, it's on record, developed
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:59.320]  what became psychiatry. It's not Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud and all that. So of course
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:04.320]  the Germans developed the Hessian soldiers who loved being slaves, loved being military
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:09.320]  slaves. They had slavery in Germany, white slaves, and they were happy to be white slaves.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.320]  And they said, well, the British royalty was German royalty. It was really Transylvanian
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.320]  royalty. They'd always said, you've got the best soldier slaves. How do you do it? They
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.320]  don't even run off very often.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.320]  Though some of them did actually run off here because there were big German communities.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  They broke their conditioning. They had the blue uniforms, the big black boots. That's
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:33.320]  where that all comes from, Hessian boots. And they were the main force that was backing
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.320]  up the Redcoats. And of course, Washington beat a bunch of them at Trenton, New Jersey
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:42.320]  famously. But, Charles, the point is in the video that we just reposted along with the
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.320]  PDF report you talked about at Infowars.com, you break it all down eloquently with the
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.320]  documents. But the British royalty funded people to go over and figure this out. And
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.320]  then you've got the German and the British connection funding Skull and Bones being set
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:01.320]  up as this think tank. Please continue because this is so key, what you discovered and all
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.320]  these connections.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:09.320]  Well, it's terribly important because when I started out, I didn't understand behavior,
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  operating conditioning. It's so simple, folks. It's simply when you go to the doctor, the
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:20.320]  doctor hits your knee, you know, used to anyway, with a little hammer, and your knee pops up.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:26.320]  It's a neurological reaction. And Wilhelm Wundt, who was a psychologist in the mid-1800s
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:33.320]  in Leipzig, he finally realized that he could not do anything with getting people to change
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:39.320]  their behavior just using regular philosophy and psychology. Because the soul, he couldn't
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  deal with the soul, it floats around, right? So he decided just to use the neurology. And
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.320]  if you can understand that, you understand why Americans just have these reflexes and
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.320]  you tell them something and they, if you reward them immediately, they'll do anything you
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.320]  want for the rest of time. But the important thing about this relationship with Skull and
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:09.320]  Bones is that Wilhelm Wundt, he was born in 1832 in Germany. His father was a minister.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:17.320]  His grandfather, Kirchner Karl Casimir Wundt, was professor of Heidelberg University. And
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:26.320]  the Illuminati order documents that we've been able to get a hold of, that Raphael in
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:34.320]  the Illuminati is identified as the same professor Karl Casimir Wundt and is referred to in the
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:42.320]  Illuminati provincial report from Utica 1782. Now that is the grandfather of Wilhelm Wundt.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:47.320]  So this method that is being introduced in the United States mainly, of course, is a
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:52.320]  computer, because as B.F. Skinner said, the computer is my box. And Skinner followed in
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:59.320]  the steps of Pavlov, who interestingly enough was trained by Wundt, not the other way around.
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:06.320]  So what's going in now is this method I'm talking to you about this minute operant conditioning.
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:11.320]  Now, you know it with your dog, you know, you want your dog to sit, you give him a sit,
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:15.320]  you give the dog a sit, he'll sit for you the next time. When I first saw this in the
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.320]  U.S. Department of Ed, I wondered, all these books that I would see in the bookshelves
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:24.320]  of the department said, what works? And I didn't pay much attention. One day I pulled
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:29.320]  it out, a book out, and I saw this is under Carol Bell. This is some of the big secrets
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:35.320]  here. Stay there. Charlotte Isherby is our guest. The amazing book back in print, The

[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:19.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:29.320]  By the way, we've got the West Point grad who was arrested for photographing police here in Austin.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:35.320]  It's a big story now, now a national story, because it looks like they set him up.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:40.320]  He's going to be in studio with us. He's pretty stressed out from all the attention he's given.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.320]  He's going to be on the nightly news tonight. We've got some other guests as well.
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:51.320]  Paul Watson will do the news portion. I'm going to do the interviews, the two interviews this evening.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:57.320]  The comedian and social commentary guy Lionel will also be on with us via Skype.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:01.320]  But let's go back to Charlotte. This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:06.320]  So, Charlotte, you start discovering all of this and then now years later are able to tie it into Skull and Bones.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.320]  But you were saying you pulled off the shelf at the Department of Education.
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:16.320]  This book was talking about what works. What works? Well, what works is animal psychology.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:20.320]  And that's just what I told you with your dog. You can train your dog. It's very, very simple.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:25.320]  All of you must understand that that is simply, that is the computer technology.
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:29.320]  When your child has the computer, no more books. Books are down the tubes.
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  All the history of this is in my book, which is the abbreviated version.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.320]  But it's a fantastic version. Nothing chronological has been taken out.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:42.320]  And this is the history of what happened.
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:50.320]  But getting into the computer, when the top people like at YCAT,
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:56.320]  World Institute for Computer Assisted Teaching, Dustin Houston said this, folks, and parents listen.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.320]  He knew what was coming. This was 20 years ago.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:04.320]  He said, won't it be wonderful when the student in the most remote part of the country
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:09.320]  can have the equivalent of five of the world's greatest psychologists on the computer?
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:17.320]  And nobody will be able to get between the student and the software, the computer.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:20.320]  So it's very, very dangerous.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.320]  And even the tops of educators who are involved in computer technology,
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.320]  I got fired for leaking a document by one of these educators.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:36.320]  It was one of his major grants, Better Education Skills Through Technology.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:42.320]  This fellow, Donald Ely, he admitted in his internal papers that if you don't agree,
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:48.320]  as a computer tech guy or professor, if you don't agree with the message,
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:51.320]  you do not put it on that software.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:56.320]  You have to have a conscience because it is so powerful.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  Now, folks, this is what's going in now. No more books.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:03.320]  Well, I mean, it allows total centralization.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:08.320]  This is what Stalin brought back into the United States from Wilhelm Munch,
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:11.320]  who was directly connected with the Illuminati.
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:16.320]  This is what they brought back to this G. Stanley Hall into the United States.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:20.320]  They stacked all of the universities, Columbia, Chicago, et cetera,
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:27.320]  with people like Dewey, Thorndike, et al., who believe man is nothing but an animal to be trained.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:34.320]  Now, C.S. Lewis was the one who said, when you stop educating and you start training,
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.320]  which is what they're doing right now for the planned economy, global,
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:46.320]  when you stop educating and you start training, civilization dies.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:49.320]  Now, that's C.S. Lewis, all right?
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:53.320]  Now, my little book, the abbreviated version, is fantastic.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:57.320]  All the sections that have been taken out, the big chunks, the appendices, the index, et cetera,
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.320]  are available free at my website.
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:04.320]  It's a free download, the old book, The Big Baby.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:08.320]  So anybody who wants to check on what may have been removed,
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.320]  there are three little dark T's.
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.320]  Whenever something's removed, they just go on the Internet.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:16.320]  But it's a very user-friendly, beautiful book.
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.320]  I find myself, my son said to me,
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.320]  Mom, I've never seen you reading your book as much as you're reading it now.
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:26.320]  Well, I am because it's so nice and small and handy.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.320]  And I just delight in my own book.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.320]  It was always very, very big.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.320]  And we had people who loved it, obviously,
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:37.320]  or it wouldn't be out of print and selling for $1,000 in some places.
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:38.320]  You know, ridiculous.
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.320]  $200, $400, $600 at Amazon.
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.320]  It's the old book, right?
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:45.320]  The people who got old copies or whatever.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:50.320]  But it was always large and rather cumbersome.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.320]  Now this is a beautiful version that you can give to your friends.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.320]  It is.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.320]  Charlotte, stay there.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:57.320]  Let's come back.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:04:58.320]  We've got to go to break.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.320]  Let's tie in the Illuminati to Skull and Bones to education.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:05.320]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.320]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:09.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:12.320]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:13.320]  It's true.
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:16.320]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.320]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.320]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:23.320]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.320]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:29.320]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:30.320]  for you and your family.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.320]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:34.320]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:38.320]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:41.320]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.320]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:52.320]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.320]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:57.320]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:06:23.320]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.320]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:09.320]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:11.320]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:17.320]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:24.320]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:30.320]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:38.320]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:44.320]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:48.320]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:50.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.320]  It's here.

[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:08.320]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:10.320]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.320]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:22.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:32.320]  Yesterday, I interviewed an investigative journalist breaking down government documents
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:39.320]  where over 40 known cancer viruses were added to the polio vaccines.
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:41.320]  It's still done.
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.320]  I have other top scientists and doctors like Russell Blalock on.
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.320]  And the only conclusion they can come to is that it's being done by design.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.320]  The aspartame, the MSG, the additives.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:02.320]  And then, lo and behold, we have all these UN and Club of Rome documents in Rockefeller Foundation
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:09.320]  where they're adding the chemicals into the food, the water, the additives, the printer ink.
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:14.320]  And so, Charlotte Isby's hitting it from another angle, breaking down skull and bones.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:19.320]  And where the elite got this philosophy to dumb people down.
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:22.320]  Now, they put this fog of chemicals and things out there.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  But then, to make us animals and to tell us we're animals and don't have free will,
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  while they play the part of God, these Illuminati believe they are man, we are the profane animal.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:43.320]  But to make us the animal, they bombard us with this and then try to train us, not educate us.
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:49.320]  And that's programming versus learning the mysteries of the world, learning to enjoy knowledge and systems.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.320]  They want people to be very one-dimensional.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:57.320]  Now, Charlotte Isby's not only one of the most famous whistleblowers.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:00.320]  I'm building her up. She'll talk herself down.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:04.320]  But she was the head of policy department education that blew the whistle, brought the documents out,
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  got basically fired over it.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  And her book documents that, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:14.320]  But then, she's also the lady that helped give Anthony Sutton the material that exposed skull and bones.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:20.320]  But in decades later, continuing to research, that was hiding under her nose as well,
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:26.320]  that it was skull and bones that actually set the modern policy for all of this.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.320]  Now, you were getting into the Illuminati connections, Charlotte, go ahead.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.320]  Well, this is fascinating.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:35.320]  I mean, things that happened in my life are unbelievable.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:40.320]  But you're right, for about 30 years, I did all the research on B.F. Skinner and Pavlov
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.320]  and how these methods like the reading method, direct instruction that the conservatives
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.320]  managed to get across the country now because it's necessary for workforce training.
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:54.320]  Of course, they got into reading first, experimenting on the minorities with it, et cetera.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:58.320]  But I was studying this stuff and I knew it makes children sick.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:03.320]  I have a friend, a great teacher in Arizona, Ann Herzer, who educated me.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.320]  And I have all the documents from doctors about how this operating conditioning,
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:10.320]  these programs make children sick.
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.320]  And, you know, anyway, so here I'm looking at all this, I have all the major documents.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.320]  It takes me quite a long time.
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  I understand that, but I had no idea that the order at Yale that my father and grandfather belonged to,
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.320]  it was the order that actually brought this method back from Germany.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.320]  And it's very interesting because the Germans are extremely involved in this.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.320]  They were and perhaps still are.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.320]  I mean, in the fraud thing, Dennis Cuddy has just written a wonderful new book,
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:48.320]  which my son is reading, which deals with how all of this stuff is the Germans, is Nazi stuff too.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:53.320]  So it's not just the communists, it's the Nazis, the fascists, the socialists.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:56.320]  I would say America is not an innocent country.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:00.320]  We are really deep in the mess right now with the isms.
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:04.320]  But anyway, going back to the order, so little Charlotte, you know,
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:09.320]  the one that gets fired from the department for leaking these documents,
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.320]  I knew how bad the Department of Education was.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:14.320]  It's a total Marxist factory, right?
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:19.320]  All of a sudden, you know, I find out, basically I find out, most of this,
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:23.320]  I found out from Anthony Sutton, who had done the research.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:29.320]  He's the one who found out about the connection with Wilhelm Lynch with the Illuminati.
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.320]  Wilhelm Lynch's grandfather was a member of the Illuminati.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:38.320]  Well, I remember I sent Tony Sutton, there were some documents in German that I never saw again,
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:40.320]  but I sent them to Sutton.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:43.320]  I didn't know what they were, but Sutton got to it.
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:45.320]  I don't know whether I lost them when he returned them.
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:51.320]  But anyway, I am quite truly convinced that, let's go to it this way, folks.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.320]  There is nothing more important than the loss of free will.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.320]  We have a soul and a conscience.
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:05.320]  What was brought back from Germany, offering conditioning, Pavlov's studies under one,
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  this is the method to destroy the human individual made in the image of God,
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.320]  to destroy his conscience.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:19.320]  You must remember this, I think you probably think I'm exaggerating.
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  I'm not.
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  This is what we're looking at.
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:28.320]  This is more important than anything being talked about in the news today.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.320]  The loss of the conscience.
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:34.320]  I've written a lot on this, it's on the internet, you can find my articles.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:43.320]  This is what happened when the order at Yale decided to get their guys, educators,
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:49.320]  educated in Germany and many of the under, actually it was G. Stanley Roth was the first one,
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:55.320]  and he admits to being half a Marxist himself back in the mid 1800s, mind you.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.320]  He admitted to that.
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:01.320]  So he brings it back, it's picked up by Dewey and Thorndike, et cetera,
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:08.320]  and the method goes into the teachers colleges and our teachers are trained to train our students.
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.320]  Train, train, not educate.
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:12.320]  Of course, this didn't happen until 1965.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  Now the result of this, one could see this morning, I opened up the computer,
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:21.320]  it was Fox News, interesting enough, which won't cover my book, of course,
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:25.320]  but they did cover like, oh my goodness me, how can this be possible?
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:30.320]  This Jack Chambers, an economic professor of the college, I didn't get it all written down,
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:34.320]  he asked his students what the American dream means to them.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:36.320]  This is in college.
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:41.320]  And he asked specifically, what do you think the government should do?
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.320]  Well, 10% good for them said leave me alone.
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:52.320]  80% said that the government should take care of their vacations, make sure they get a good job,
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:59.320]  give them health care, give them housing, and that the wealthy should be taxed more.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:04.320]  Now, there was one individual who said, can you believe this one?
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:09.320]  As human beings, we are not responsible for our actions.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:12.320]  We need the government to keep us in line for it.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.320]  Now, that's not a direct quote, I just sort of remember that,
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.320]  but first of all, this individual who says we need the government to keep us in line
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:28.320]  and we're not responsible for our actions, that student evidently was very carefully trained in Darwin.
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:33.320]  They were animals, so they made a mistake, they still think they're human beings, but they're not.
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  Well, you're right.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.320]  These people have been conditioned and trained like animals,
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:43.320]  only through from the time that G Stanley Hall went over to Germany for the order and came back,
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:49.320]  we trained, and now what we're looking at is the computer technology is nothing but pavlovian.
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:54.320]  And that allows total centralization of the message, but expanding on that,
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.320]  and we see a global curriculum being standardized.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  I've seen the studies that there are now more sociopaths than there used to be,
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:09.320]  and even more psychopaths, and that the system is creating artificial sociopaths.
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.320]  Normally their numbers were much lower,
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  but they can also have it where they flip on a switch that makes you a sociopath,
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:23.320]  but they can flip it back off when they want you to feel, so it's total programming.
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:30.320]  It's like they're biological androids, and it's so scientifically done.
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:36.320]  How is their plan going along for them from your deep research of this from every angle?
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.320]  Well, I'm afraid they're highly successful,
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.320]  and the reason for this, Alex, is another thing that I've always bewildered us.
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:47.320]  Why is it that, for instance, when I wrote my book in 1985, The Little 39 Pager,
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:50.320]  Back to Basics Reformed, that exposed all of this scary stuff,
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:55.320]  and said it was for world government, which would arise in the 21st century, all of that.
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.320]  That book was boycotted across the board by the conservative movement,
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:02.320]  if that book had been listened to in 1985,
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  we might not have this canary and opera conditioning on the computers, et cetera, right now,
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:08.320]  but they boycotted it.
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.320]  Now, wait a minute, isn't that interesting?
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.320]  The conservatives, this is under Ronald Reagan, okay?
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:18.320]  So anyway, that happened, and then I wrote my big book,
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:22.320]  because I figured maybe this will get, well, that was boycotted by them too.
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.320]  They've done nothing to get the big book, and they do not want this information.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:30.320]  Now, I'm sure the Democrats are involved in it as well,
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:34.320]  and they've paid for the funding, and they love the Department of Education, blah, blah, blah,
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:41.320]  but I have to say that the school to work agenda, which requires school choice,
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.320]  school choice is the most devastatingly bad thing that ever happened to this country,
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:49.320]  because it's not really school choice whatsoever,
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:53.320]  it's federally funded charter schools that don't have elected officials running them,
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  because the corporations are going to run those charter schools to train for the workforce
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:01.320]  with the canary and opera conditioning on the computer.
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:03.320]  Now, this is the conservatives supporting this,
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.320]  because conservatives are notable for wanting to make money, right?
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:10.320]  I mean, we know that is nothing wrong with making money,
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:18.320]  but when you decide that you're going to turn your children over to be nothing but slaves in this planned economy,
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:22.320]  to be moved around the world, and a lot of these quotes in my book from educators,
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:25.320]  they're going to be moved around the world wherever they need them,
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:33.320]  using nothing but computer technology, opera conditioning, et cetera, to train them lifelong, lifelong, all of this is lifelong.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:39.320]  Yeah, but Charlotte, there's also all these globalist groups now pushing the solution to the New World Order
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:44.320]  is mega computers that make all the decisions for us,
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  but really those computers are programmed by the globalists themselves.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:50.320]  It's a new form of tyranny.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:58.320]  Yes, it is, and Alex, what we have to understand is that we've lost, I hate to say this,
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:02.320]  and maybe it's not completely true, but I believe we have lost the Christian community,
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:05.320]  because the Christian community, evangelicals,
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  we always depended on them to support us in trying to get rid of these bad programs,
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.320]  especially Skinner and all.
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  I never got any support for them from that community.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:20.320]  In fact, they even said that some of us were nutty.
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  They said that we didn't know what we were talking about with Skinner.
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:28.320]  We were wrong about these computerized individualized education software and all.
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  They went up against us, and I always wondered, what is going on?
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:40.320]  Well, now we know, because they have been trained by Peter Drucker.
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:43.320]  Peter Drucker went all over the country.
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:49.320]  Let's stay there. Let's expose that and talk about Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.320]  They now are funding and running a lot of these, quote, charter schools.
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:56.320]  Part of it, of course, is tax money still,
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:03.320]  and they're openly teaching eugenics, Kilgranny, for money, I mean everything.
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.320]  Folks, have you lost your power and want to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:11.320]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear,
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:15.320]  because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:16.320]  Here's why.
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:20.320]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:22.320]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:27.320]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:30.320]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:33.320]  amidst no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:37.320]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:43.320]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:49.320]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:52.320]  Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:58.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:03.320]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnebel from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:06.320]  As you know, federal government spending is at an all-time high,
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:09.320]  and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:14.320]  European government and central bank spending policies have put the European Union on the brink of collapse.
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:17.320]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:19.320]  Are your assets working for you or against you?
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:20.320]  One thing is certain.
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:25.320]  Having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar,
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:27.320]  your investment will never be worthless.
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:30.320]  It will protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:34.320]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals,
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:37.320]  or having an IRA in precious metals, I can help.
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:43.320]  Call me today, Peter Kronschnebel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:48.320]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:52.320]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:55.320]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:22:00.320]  Call Peter at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:05.320]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:35.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:41.320]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:44.320]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:49.320]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:55.320]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237.

[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:03.320]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:06.320]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior?
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:09.320]  Staining your teeth and getting ashes everywhere?
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:14.320]  Why? When you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by LASIG.

[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:42.320]  That's 870-518-4307.

[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:52.320]  Warning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or cancer.
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:56.320]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:59.320]  You must be 18 years or older to purchase.
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:10.320]  Don't worry, this show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:18.320]  All right, we're gonna have a giant news blitz, I promise, at 40 after when Charlotte Thompson Iserby leaves us.
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:22.320]  Whistleblower, author, researcher, patriot.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:33.320]  And again, she's not against you having school choice, but this is now just the corporations taking over the old local, quote, independent school district system.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:39.320]  Draining off their funding, putting only in a little bit of their money, and getting control.
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:46.320]  Now, you were breaking down how you discovered why you were blocked by, quote, conservatives.
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.320]  But then also, take the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:52.320]  They are involved in education in every level.
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:58.320]  They're involved, just like Obama was, breaking up local schools and turning them over to corporations.
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.320]  That's what they're now doing.
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:09.320]  And I could play clips of Bill Gates up there saying, you don't give grandma healthcare, we can hire ten teachers, and the teacher's clapping.
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:16.320]  So they're even selling this idea of cannibalism, that you take something away from somebody, you get their resources.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.320]  That's not how the world really works.
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:25.320]  It's a win-win-win, build the pie system is what we want, not a post-industrial, shut it down system.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:33.320]  So it's incredibly dangerous and classically authoritarian, but you notice with the TSA checkpoints and the groping of our families,
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:42.320]  I mean, they admit the TSA stuff is to break you, is to train you, is to Pavlovianly get you used to them putting their hands on your body.
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:45.320]  I mean, this is all dog training, as you said.
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:54.320]  Well, yes, Alex, and talking about the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates is totally involved in putting us under this international socialist system.
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:58.320]  Or whatever you want to call it, fascist, communist totalitarian system, he's very involved.
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:09.320]  I mean, Microsoft has got agreements with communist China and Russia and everywhere, and Gates has signed all sorts of agreements himself.
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:11.320]  And so they're really bad.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:13.320]  Now, talking about the foundations, let's get there.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:19.320]  The taxes and foundations, you can go to my son's website, AmericanDeception.com,
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:27.320]  and you've got the transcript of the congressional investigation of the tax-exempt foundations there.
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:33.320]  There was only one copy left in the country three years ago because the foundations brought up all the copies.
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:42.320]  They didn't want the American people to know what had happened in 1953 when all these traitors had to answer questions during the investigation.
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:43.320]  They brought up all the copies.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:46.320]  They got them all out of circulation, except this one.
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:54.320]  The person I bought it from, I understand that he was offered any amount of money for that one copy, and he turned it down.
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:55.320]  I got the copy.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:27:00.320]  My son put it up on the website, 3,000 pages of documentation.
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:07.320]  That was the investigation where Norman Dodd of the Reese Committee, Reese Committee, went up to New York,
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:12.320]  and off the record, that's why it's not on the internet, it's not in the transcript,
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:17.320]  but off the record, the president of the Ford Foundation, Rowan Gaither, said to him,
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.320]  Mr. Dodd, we get our instructions from the White House how to use our money.
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:27.320]  Eisenhower at the peak of the cold war, that was, and the instructions were to change America.
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:34.320]  The foundations should change America to such an extent it could be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.320]  Now, look, of course, you say it's dead.
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:37.320]  No, it's not.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:43.320]  Communism, fascism, socialism, internationalism are all exactly what Gaither was talking about.
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:44.320]  Exactly.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.320]  A fool sent me an email saying you're calling it fascist or socialist, they're two different things.
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:54.320]  No, there's different dressing, little different tweaks, but it's all black uniforms, all government run,
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:58.320]  all surveillance, all state planned with the corporations over it.
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:27:59.320]  It's all the same thing.
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:01.320]  That's exactly what we're looking at.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:04.320]  So what Dodd was told is absolutely correct.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.320]  Gaither told him it would be this merger.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:12.320]  And if you go back to Lenin, Lenin said, look, first of all, all countries individually become socialists.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:14.320]  That's what Carol Quigley wrote.
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:17.320]  He said there's no difference between fascism and communism.
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:18.320]  We work with all of it.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:20.320]  We are creating a fusion of it.
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:23.320]  But they merge, once they're socialists, then they merge in regions.
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:25.320]  So we've got all the regions being set up.
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:29.320]  Gorbachev called the European Union, the new European Soviet.
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:32.320]  And now the regional, regionalism is communism.
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:36.320]  And that quote is in my book, a very interesting quote.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:37.320]  Look it up.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:42.320]  Morris Zeitlin, he sees a communist bloke, the communist daily world in the 70s.
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:48.320]  He said the United States has got to go have more regional government because it works so well in the Soviet Union.
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:57.320]  It's going in now, folks, all over the place with sustainable development, dropping borders, getting rid of elected officials.
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:59.320]  Don't forget, charter schools don't have elected officials.
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:06.320]  So you're paying taxes to run these charter schools, which use a federal test, federal test.
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:09.320]  And all it really is is a globalist school.
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.320]  Yes.
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:18.320]  And those schools, 60 percent of the federal test is attitudinal, how they feel about the environment, what they think about the U.N.
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:20.320]  or whatever, you know, do they believe in God?
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:28.320]  Sixty percent of that test that the charter school students must take because it's a federally funded entity is political.
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:29.320]  Now, remember that.
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:30.320]  Yes.
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:36.320]  So they remove true education about issues and about ideas and about and about science.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.320]  It just all turns into pablum.
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:42.320]  So the kids are good little robots and they burn that time up, not really teaching them.
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:44.320]  We'll be right back with solutions.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:45.320]  Stay there, Charlotte.
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:46.320]  Final segment straight ahead with our guest.
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:30:00.320]  Then News Pledge coming up.
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:07.320]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:12.320]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:21.320]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:29.320]  They sew pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:34.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:39.320]  Blue diamond gusset's got it up her stone.
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:42.320]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:46.320]  Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:51.320]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you could
[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:53.320]  ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:55.320]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:57.320]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:58.320]  Got it.
[02:30:58.320 --> 02:30:59.320]  Others don't.
[02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:04.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:05.320]  generator.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:09.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:14.320]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.320]  you to have.
[02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:16.320]  It's true.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:20.320]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:25.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:29.320]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:32.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:36.320]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:41.320]  Number five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:44.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.320]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:50.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:52.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:54.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.320 --> 02:32:01.320]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.320]  Hi, folks.
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:03.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:07.320]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:08.320]  risk.
[02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:09.320]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:14.320]  The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:19.320]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:25.320]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:26.320]  or antibacterials.
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:32.320]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.320]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:38.320]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:40.320]  to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:48.320]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:56.320]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:35.240]  All right, it's our final segment with Charlotte Iserby and again, we're selling the book.
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:40.200]  She has the old big thick version up for free on her website and just didn't want to deal
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.400]  with the hard copy anymore and people convinced her, hey, this is important to have a hard
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:44.400]  copy of.
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:49.720]  They can shut stuff off the web really easy, so she's put out a new updated, abridged,
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:51.200]  revised shorter one.
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:53.760]  It's only 450 something pages long.
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:34:00.040]  It's excellent and every teacher, every educator you know needs a copy of this because then
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:02.680]  everything will make sense to them and it has all the documents.
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:05.000]  I mean, she was the head of policy.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.760]  That's the number two position at the Department of Education.
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:14.000]  She's published the documents where they admit they want a global Soviet system run by the
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  mega elite.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.660]  They want to shut down all their competition and you notice everything we warn you about
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:22.580]  keeps happening because we've got all their documents.
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:24.240]  That's what's so frustrating about this.
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:28.000]  Charlotte, we're getting into a key point there as we went to break.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  Please continue.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:34.080]  Well, I don't know where I was on that one, Alex, but all I can say is because we don't
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:35.080]  have much time left.
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:42.600]  I want, first of all, I do, the reason for the book is that I felt it had to come out
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:43.600]  at this time.
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:47.000]  I think that book is really very, very important.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:51.880]  There are many books out there, but this gives you not just education history, but the history
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:56.720]  of the insiders from the beginning of the last century or even going back into the 1800s.
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:02.800]  It's the Federal Reserve, it's everything else too that's in there, what happened, disarmament,
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:04.440]  blah, blah, blah, go on.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:09.520]  You roll a leg in signing agreements with the Soviet Union and the Carnegie Corporation
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.240]  role in agreements with the Soviet Academy of Science.
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:16.840]  All these things that, again, I will say that conservatives got to understand this.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:21.360]  I hate to say it, but you have not been informed of these things because the conservatives,
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:25.680]  let's call them neoconservatives, not going water people, they have been infiltrated,
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:28.680]  the Republican Party badly infiltrated by the left.
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:34.680]  So, you've got both parties are left and are, you can call them either a socialist or a
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:38.280]  Marxist or a fascist, doesn't make any difference.
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:42.320]  Both parties are controlled and that's why we haven't been able to get this information
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.320]  out.
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.400]  What I want you to do is don't get discouraged, you've got to keep fighting, and the reason
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:52.000]  I say this is there have been many, many people, and I gave a lot of credit to these people
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.640]  in the beginning of my book, I've known them, some are dead, et cetera, they, the insiders,
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.920]  expected to bring us down, certainly in the 80s, the 1976 200th anniversary, we were meant
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:07.600]  to be basically going down, we didn't, we're still here.
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:12.480]  If those people had given up, the ones that we, you and I know and a lot of us oldsters
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:17.480]  know, they're gone now, magnificent Americans who fought for freedom, for the constitutional,
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:23.320]  if they had given up, I wouldn't even be on this program today, and Alice wouldn't have
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:24.320]  it so.
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:31.640]  So, you cannot give up, you have to keep fighting this battle, and the tool to fight it, I think,
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:37.520]  because of course I love my own book, is my little book, and it's slower, you can't complain
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:42.320]  anymore about it, meaning you can't take it on vacation, it weighs too much, now the other
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:48.480]  thing I want to say is, there's only one person out there that we can vote for, for the Republican
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:52.960]  party, there's only one person, absolutely, there's no question about it, and it's Ron
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.960]  Paul.
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.560]  It is ridiculous what's going on now, it's evil what's going on right now, they're doing
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:02.880]  to him what they did to Goldwater, back in the 60s, when they had that film of a little
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:08.040]  girl on the field, with the poppies and the bomb going off, they're gonna do that to him
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:09.040]  too.
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:12.400]  Yeah, they're saying we'll get nuked if you elect Ron Paul, same thing LBJ did.
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:18.520]  Right, so look folks, we've got good stuff out there now, we've got Ron Paul, I'm gonna
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:21.440]  keep fighting, Alex is great, he's gonna keep fighting.
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.880]  Well, Charlotte, as you know, I mean 20, 30, 40 years ago, almost nobody knew about this
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:31.360]  stuff because it was so incredible, you mean their tyrants want to slowly take over?
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:37.920]  Now it's all coming to fruition, the crop is coming in, we told folks what those plants
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:45.040]  were gonna grow, before I was born, you were warning people, and then now we see, this
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:50.640]  is tyranny they're setting up, I've never seen such an awakening happening now.
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:56.480]  Some are awakening, that's happening faster, but others are getting deeper into the trance,
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:01.400]  and you cannot reach them because they've been so damaged by the brainwashing, by the
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:02.400]  chemicals.
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:07.720]  But it's never a majority that turns things around, it's an evil minority, or a good minority
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:14.520]  that are gonna decide the destiny of the human species, and our minority is swelling, we
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.160]  are much bigger than the criminals.
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:21.240]  The young people are so important, let me say to you, don't waste time on people my
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:28.000]  age really, because they are so pathetic with their golf clubs, their retirement, I mean
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.120]  they are pathetic, I'm sorry to say it, maybe there are a few out there who aren't, but
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:37.280]  don't waste your time on them, put your time into the young people getting out of high
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:42.480]  school and college, get in there, just like Ron Paul said, there's this huge awakening
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:47.600]  among young people, and you know what, the schools may have done a good job like I pointed
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:53.040]  out earlier with 80% or whatever of those college students, but I don't believe it's
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.040]  all that bad.
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:39:00.320]  I think that the young people really are beginning to understand that they have been had, and
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:01.320]  so-
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:06.360]  Well, you know they create a fake consensus with all these fake polls, I mean, it's even
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:11.040]  quote mainstream news that there was fraud all over Iowa, just as we said two, three
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  days ago.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:13.040]  Yeah.
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:15.440]  I mean, it's just that it's so brazen, Charlotte.
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:20.000]  Yes, it is, and I think that that's why, I think the young people know this, and the
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:27.280]  other thing is Ron Paul really is the anti-war candidate, and if he was smart, that's what
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:31.840]  he would run on, even though he's anti-federal reserve and he'd love to get rid of the Department
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:35.360]  of Education, he's the only one who's really mentioned that, isn't he?
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.400]  His platform is superb, and they say it's kooky.
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:42.520]  Wait a minute, look, I always love it when people call me a kook, you know why?
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:48.200]  And I tell them, thank you, because the greatest Americans and people in the Soviet Union,
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:55.400]  et cetera, all these people who've cherished freedom were called kooks at the time, and
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:00.160]  so someone calls me a kook, thanks them, and say, you know, you've put me in really good
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:05.000]  company, I mean, with all these great people who fought for freedom.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:12.400]  Well, as you know, Charlotte, a doodle dandy was the biggest insult the British could give
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:18.720]  each other, and I don't want to tell people what it means, but it's a slang, and you know
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:21.840]  what, we said good, we're going to have a song called Yankee Doodle Dandy.
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.040]  That's very interesting, good for you all, I didn't know that, but you know, the thing
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:33.240]  is that that is rock chissum, that's all those guys, Alger Hinson, in 1945 at the UN, who
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:36.960]  said they're going to use psychiatry to get rid of our conscience.
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.600]  These are the people who said, we're crazy, see, we're crazy, because we think, and because
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:46.800]  we know that war, we know war is wrong, but we know that sometimes you have to take a
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:49.240]  stand, but they don't want us to fall.
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:54.280]  No, no, no, they teach us to not be warlike, so they can wage war on us, they say, truce.
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:41:00.560]  That's exactly what we are, our military is nothing but the United Nations military arm,
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.620]  to patrol the whole world has nothing to do with protecting the United States.
[02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:11.080]  And the good part for the globalist is, when they do all this imperial evil, and the massacres,
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:16.280]  their own globalist media tells the world about it, and then blames America.
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.280]  And then we're domestically told it's great, and everybody loves us, for the future destruction
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:21.280]  of this country politically.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.400]  I mean, the globalist are such masters, that they have America doing all their dirty work.
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.080]  I mean, Rupert Murdoch's publications will bad mouth the war and stuff overseas, but
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:33.680]  then domestically he's all for it.
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:37.600]  And again, they know exactly what they're doing, they don't play by any rules.
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:43.520]  The book is available at infowars.com, with Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, a new
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.680]  edition, a smaller edition, it's been out of print for a year, available at infowars.com.
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:52.520]  And Charlotte, thank you for putting the book back out, I know the big thick one is free
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:58.120]  on your website, and give folks that address as well for people that can't afford the soft
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:41:59.120]  cover.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:07.760]  DeliberateDumbingDown.com, and you can just go there, and you can read it on the internet,
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:12.360]  it's a big book to read on the internet, but please, that's why it's there.
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:17.880]  And AmericanDeception.com is also a free website for all the documents to back up-
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:23.260]  And let's be clear, when you send a friend, or family, or teacher the email with the link,
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:25.600]  people don't tend to appreciate something that's free.
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:29.480]  It's like, here's all this work, it's free, please warn people, here's the total blueprint
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:34.880]  of the enemy operation in education, yeah, you say the schools, George Carlin said they
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.160]  want you dumb, well here's the proof, yeah, George Carlin's right.
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:43.840]  Here's their own criminal blueprint all put together for you, all sourced, and tell people
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.820]  you better look at this.
[02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:50.680]  But most people will still appreciate a book, so if you do buy the book, it's like here,
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:54.440]  I read it, here it is, schoolteacher, I've got the most important parts highlighted,
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  or to your school board, or whatever, cuz most of these people are not evil operatives,
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:04.160]  they have grown up multi-generationally in this, and now it's getting so deep.
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:06.160]  Charlotte, look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:10.360]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex, and keep up your good work, and happy new year to all your
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:11.360]  listeners.
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:12.680]  Thank you so much, and God bless you.
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:13.680]  Bye, bye.
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:17.560]  All right, there goes Charlotte Thompson Isherby, the book Deliberate Dumbing Down of America,
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:25.920]  available at Infowars.com, or by calling 888-253-3139 here at our office.
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:32.280]  You can also write to us at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:36.880]  We also have the Everything special, we call it the New Year special, I've never had a
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:40.160]  deal this good, but we're gonna keep it running for the rest of the month, cuz it's getting
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:41.160]  the word out.
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:47.500]  All 18 of my films on DVD are 99.95, all of them, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:53.920]  Game Game, Terror Storm, 99.95 right now, normally 360 smackers.
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:58.720]  And your funding of this operation allows us to continue and hopefully expand, and we're
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:01.520]  really working hard here, as you know.
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:08.240]  Because we understand this information is too important, I mean, I separated some ribs,
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:12.280]  cracked some stuff, dropping a big weight on myself last weekend, I'm like an idiot,
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:16.800]  do an incline weight, just slipped out of my hands, I was going too fast, it came out.
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:21.120]  Most people would be in bed right now, and I'm not whining about it, I'm not doing some
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:23.120]  great service being here.
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:30.320]  Wild horses cannot drag me away, I mean, I want to do productions, I want to make films,
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:34.840]  I want to get the word out, I want to warn people, I want to stop these people.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:39.680]  Because it's so frustrating to know these are wanton evil criminals that use psychological
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:45.600]  warfare and false reality systems that they've taught people to get a lot of good men and
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:50.600]  women out there to not even ever become conscious human beings, and to be mind slaves to these
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:54.000]  globalists and carry out all this evil.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:57.960]  I don't even hate their minions anymore, I used to really get mad at minions of the system,
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:03.360]  and now I'm just like, man, it's frustrating, like I know what I'm talking about, I live
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:09.200]  this stuff, I read documents till I'm blue in the face, I understand how the system works,
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:14.640]  I understand that most people are not bad.
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.380]  And I understand this a lot more than even some of their high level people, because they're
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:23.840]  all compartmentalizers do in their sector, they're trained to do it, they do it.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:31.520]  And I've gotten the level of a master architect understanding of the overall integrated systems
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:36.560]  of how they run this thing, and let me tell you, it doesn't look like it's human built.
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:42.960]  I'm not into space aliens, reptoids, any of that, I'm just saying it's hard to believe
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:48.400]  that humans would actually consciously be trying to set this up, because they're trying
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:49.920]  to screw up the planet.
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:54.740]  They're trying to splice every animal and every plant and creating abominations that
[02:45:54.740 --> 02:45:57.080]  are already causing irrevocable problems.
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:03.600]  They're already got a lot of the key species dying out, honeybees and things like that.
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:07.640]  It's other top scientists I've had on, they say it's like it's space aliens that wanna
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:09.640]  destroy the Earth or something.
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:13.200]  And then they know that we're concerned about this, so they take over the environmental
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:18.240]  movement and make it an anti-human, anti-carbon dioxide movement.
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:24.160]  They are such masters at knowing how you're gonna think and what you're gonna do and creating
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:31.700]  false systems to capture your energy, to capture your resistance, it's just unbelievable.
[02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:37.680]  And they love hurting good things, they love defacing good things, they love screwing things
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:38.680]  up.
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:43.720]  It's so hard preaching here, it's just, it's the devil, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:45.680]  how else to explain it to you.
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.760]  But when you get right down to hardcore 18 hour a day research, you run smack dab up
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:51.760]  against it.
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:55.360]  The leadership are devil worshippers, Lucifer worshippers, they think Lucifer is God and
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:57.360]  they're just sick freaks.
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:01.060]  They are super smart, sick freaks and it's skull and bones.
[02:47:01.060 --> 02:47:05.520]  They think they're guided by the devil and they worship the devil and ABC News captured
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:06.520]  it on tape.
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:11.700]  I mean, it's like what in the world are we facing here?
[02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:17.560]  And they've got all these well-meaning people that will go and shoot Iraqi women for almost
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:22.180]  no reason and call them subhuman and think they're good guys.
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:28.540]  That is mind control.
[02:47:28.540 --> 02:47:32.760]  And it's all Skinner, it's all Edward Bernays.
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:41.400]  If you just read Propaganda by Bernays, if you just know what I know, if you just read
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:44.720]  the Public Club of Rome documents, if you just read the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:48.720]  we linked to, where they put stuff in the vaccines and the food and the water to give
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:49.720]  us cancer.
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:52.280]  I mean, it's really uncool.
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:54.920]  You know, this is not about entertainment, it's not about a joke, people.
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:59.600]  It's not about, ooh, I'm a radio host and I'm up here talking to you about this stuff.
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:08.960]  This is life and death.
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:10.660]  It starts with all of us, though.
[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:14.400]  Evil couldn't have gotten away with this if people by increment didn't give in to evil
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:15.400]  and corruption.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:22.240]  I said I'd get through a bunch of news and look at this financial news, doctors going
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:27.240]  broke under Obamacare, but don't worry, they just now wanna fully nationalize healthcare
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:28.240]  and take it over.
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:29.240]  That was always the plan.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:36.400]  CNN, top 1% of mobile users consume half of world's bandwidth and the gap is growing.
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.960]  So they're saying to people, well, let us put more charges on you since other people
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:41.960]  are using too much.
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:45.000]  That's just a way to charge everybody more.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.480]  There's articles out there lying about how many jobs have really been created.
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:50.160]  We've got a big stack of news on that front.
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:54.400]  I already mentioned this, but it's big, DHS officers armed with semi-automatics set up
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:57.840]  unannounced ID checkpoints with submachine guns in Florida.
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:03.980]  I mean, you just can't make that up.
[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:07.480]  Speaking of genetic engineering, I had a big stack of news on that, but let me get to that
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:09.200]  in a minute when I find it.
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:15.320]  Proposed DNA bank could ensnare New York graffiti artists and it just goes through.
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:16.600]  England already does this in many cities.
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:20.800]  You get pulled over for speed and they take your DNA out of the cheek.
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:24.760]  They can just swab it, they put it in the database, of course, to frame you.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:29.640]  It's not, the cop doing it doesn't know that, but it's mainly to frame you and they take
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:32.720]  your blood at birth for 40 years worldwide.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.880]  Everywhere it's under the global system, there's a few countries are mopping up and don't worry,
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:38.720]  they fly over there and spray stuff on them.
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:39.720]  They're not getting away with anything.
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:45.200]  They're gonna be mutated, murdered by these criminals, just devil ghouls we're dealing
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:46.920]  with.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:53.480]  There's that report out of Reuters.
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:57.440]  We've got, I'm digging up my reporter.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:49:58.880]  The problem is I've got too much news.
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:49:59.880]  This is just totally insane.
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:04.460]  I got a whole stack of news here about genetic engineering and stuff.
[02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:05.680]  Here it is.
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:07.280]  Welcome to a brave new world.
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:12.800]  Genetic scientists create franken, freakish man-made monster ants with huge heads and
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:13.800]  jaws.
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:15.960]  I'm gonna cover this on the nightly news tonight.
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:16.960]  Here's another one.
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:24.480]  Meet the chimera monkey, this is Daily Mail, made from the cells of six different animals.
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.560]  You know what that does zoologically, the viral mutations that creates?
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:35.160]  I mean, folks, it's gonna start now not being cancer at 2,000% or 3,000% what it was 50
[02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:36.160]  years ago.
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:40.320]  It's gonna start being just everybody dying around you, are being cut up and sliced up
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:45.920]  as the whole financial system goes bankrupt by design and the medical system goes bankrupt,
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:47.560]  which is designed to do.
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.280]  They create the medical crisis, soft killing everybody, then it collapses, then you got
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:58.040]  government-run healthcare, which will deliver the murdering system that much more deadly.
[02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:02.160]  It's just pure evil.
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.800]  If you're taking one, two, five or more nutritional supplements, please stop.
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:12.160]  Simplify your supplementation with BioSuperfood, the most advanced nutritional whole food supplement

[02:52:04.120 --> 02:52:07.560]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:08.880]  like no one is home.
[02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:13.160]  Don't let your home be the next target, make it look like someone is home watching television
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:14.620]  with fake TV.
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:18.880]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television,
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:22.080]  so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:26.580]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:52:26.580 --> 02:52:31.320]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm and is highly recommended by numerous
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:32.600]  police departments.
[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:34.360]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:04.800]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in Fukushima,
[02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:09.600]  Japan and making its way across the entire U.S. continent, contaminating the air, water
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:10.600]  and food?
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:15.240]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here, as a result radiation poisoning
[02:53:15.240 --> 02:53:19.880]  is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S. unless you do something to protect
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:20.880]  yourself.
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:21.880]  How?

[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:09.520]  Folks, this is a scientific dictatorship, they look at you in their little lab coats
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:17.440]  like an animal, they've set up a whole system to control and manipulate you, schools across
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:24.000]  the country are admittedly watching kids at home on their laptops, I mentioned this earlier,
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:28.520]  big brother in St. Louis, schools plan to monitor students' activity at home with these
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:32.920]  medical wristbands, all the students tracking their heart rates, everything, just training
[02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:37.380]  you that you're a prisoner, and to see if the parents will go along with it.
[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:43.920]  And now California is inoculating school students without parental consent, and we've caught
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:46.760]  schools before doing it and claiming it's an accident.
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:51.160]  They take your blood at birth and tell you it's for a blood test, and they're liars and
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:52.160]  they're caught lying.
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:56.320]  And they were just saying, Alex, you haven't mentioned the article about how the new window's
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:01.760]  coming out, won't have a mouse, it'll be eye-tracked.
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:06.820]  Well absolutely, what do you think the Kinect put out by Microsoft does?
[02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:14.240]  It's a face scan, see, the technology all is, it's not even a Trojan horse.
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.900]  The reason you think you have a computer, the reason you think you go on Google is the
[02:55:18.900 --> 02:55:21.080]  side vestigial reason.
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:26.520]  It's all designed to track and control you.
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.720]  Microsoft said a decade ago that they're gonna have internet ID by law, but before that,
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.720]  it won't matter because you're gonna thumbprint and face scan to activate your computer.
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:38.720]  It will not turn on.
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:43.240]  Now even local banks are trying to pressure us when we get wires in from advertisers or
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:48.120]  we're gonna wire money or something to do a voice print deal, not even a code or not
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:49.120]  even a.
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:55.800]  I mean, and then again, they can tax and trace and shut you down.
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:58.560]  They can put any fees they want on you.
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:03.900]  It's a system where you're like a rat in a big computerized maze.
[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:09.280]  And then now I see all the big Republican talk show hosts freaking out over Obama saying,
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:13.600]  I'll just appoint judges now in America.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:15.960]  They're saying, but this has never been done before.
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:17.640]  These aren't recess appointments.
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:18.640]  We're not in recess.
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:20.600]  These are permanent appointments.
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:21.600]  Remember the quote?
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:25.160]  Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting.
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:26.160]  Remember Bush?
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:29.520]  Things would be a heck of a lot easier if this is a dictatorship, just so long as I'm
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:30.520]  the dictator.
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:31.520]  Hey, hey, hey.
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:32.520]  Remember that?
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:35.400]  You can pull that up.
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:44.440]  I mean, it's open creepiness in your face beyond what you could even imagine.
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.360]  And it's just gonna get more insane from here on out.
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:49.000]  And you're like, well, at least we're on the air talking about it.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.840]  Yeah, and now they're talking about shutting people down.
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:55.120]  I mean, it's everyone going along with this, we're destroying ourselves.
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:56.120]  That's what's so frustrating.
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:59.440]  99% of people are compartmentalized.
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:02.920]  They may even hate the New World Order, but you still go along with it because it's all
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:03.920]  around you.
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:07.800]  We've got to start really realizing this is the big issue.
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:09.280]  This is everything.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:14.380]  All the other stuff, the football, the dramas, it's all drama.
[02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:15.440]  We're under attack.
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:16.800]  Let's get conscious to it.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:23.120]  The globalists know that if it's incremental, do you think a deer, here's an analogy, would
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:26.760]  walk out into a beautiful green field if it knew that the whole field was a giant bear
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:27.760]  trap?
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:28.920]  I just thought of a graphic of that.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:34.920]  It's the same thing of a pond being poisoned where deer come to drink.
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:38.240]  If they don't taste the poison, they're gonna drink it and all die.
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:42.320]  It's because it's not in your face, but now it is in your face because it grew slowly
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:44.240]  like the frog in the pot.
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:49.040]  People are almost totally wide open to it, and it's almost like a deer.
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:53.880]  The public's a deer walking out into a field, and you see the whole field slam shut.
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:56.880]  It's a giant Venus fly trap.
[02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:03.200]  The trees and stuff are just its teeth, and there's the meadow, and the deer walks out.
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:06.920]  It slams shut on it, and then it's a whole other vista you're looking at.
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:09.040]  I mean, it's like that.
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:14.720]  It's like people just see this as real, the system, and lies stacked on lies, and it's
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:15.720]  all a giant illusion.
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:20.320]  I gotta do five minutes of overdrive because I said I'd get to this.
[02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:24.000]  Most stations won't carry this, but it'll be on info.wars.com audio streams and the
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:27.800]  video streams we have up there now, and I'll be on the Nightly News.
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.320]  We've got a 15-day free trial running right now if you wanna support us and also see the
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:34.600]  news, and then you can download it and give it to your friends.
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:39.240]  I'm gonna come back and get into Obama and saying he basically wants to be our supreme
[02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:40.240]  ruler.
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:46.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:52.280]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:56.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.520 --> 02:58:59.360]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:04.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  at home.
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:10.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:11.000]  the shots.
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:15.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:21.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:26.160]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:28.540]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:59:28.540 --> 02:59:32.660]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check-out to?
[02:59:32.660 --> 02:59:38.480]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:39.880]  of the Republic.
[02:59:39.880 --> 02:59:46.440]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now
[02:59:46.440 --> 02:59:52.240]  in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:52.240 --> 02:59:55.720]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.720 --> 03:00:04.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:09.400]  So the system tells us we can secretly arrest you, we can torture whoever we want.
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:14.880]  We can launch wars and we'll just say they aren't wars.
[03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:18.000]  Welcome to where time stands still.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.720]  No one leaves and no one will.
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:27.260]  It is the inmates running the asylum, and look at these headlines at Infowars.com.
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:35.320]  The dictator wants to bypass Congress, the people cheer.
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:39.280]  And we got a little clip of Glenn Beck, who's been halfway endorsing Ron Paul lately cuz
[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:44.040]  he knows where his bread is buttered, has assembled a video montage that includes President
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:48.640]  Obama making references on numerous occasions to bypassing Congress in order to push forward
[03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:49.640]  his agenda.
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:55.560]  And we've done videos like that as well, rather than outrage over president's desire to ignore
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.880]  his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, the masses cheer.
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:05.300]  Yeah, he's been beta tested the last few years where he said, Congress is in my way, I wish
[03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:06.300]  I didn't have them there.
[03:01:06.300 --> 03:01:10.640]  And they're like, yay, ignore them, be our dictator.
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:15.200]  Give us Barabbas, give us evil.
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:20.320]  We've got a clip of Obama, real clear politics, one of these clips.
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:24.800]  I have an obligation as president to do what I can do without Congress, and boy, you're
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:25.800]  doing it.
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:26.800]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:33.080]  These are ideas that have support from Democrats, they have support from Republicans around
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:34.600]  the country, independents around the country.
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:39.680]  I wanna work with Congress to get them done.
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:48.320]  But when Congress refuses to act, and as a result, hurts our economy and puts our people
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:54.800]  at risk, then I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them.
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:02:01.160]  I mean, I should have led the show with that today.
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.720]  I mean, that is such a big deal.
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:07.760]  In fact, Jaron, remind me, on Sunday, I'll be live this Sunday, four to six.
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:14.760]  Will you please assemble all those clips we can, the one Becky Poo has, but just find
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:15.760]  the originals.
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:18.760]  I know dude's got a bunch, we played them a few weeks ago.
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:22.240]  We need to talk about this, I mean, this is getting creepier and creepier.
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:26.520]  If they don't act, it's this idea of Congress needs to get more done.
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:29.860]  No, the founders said separation of powers, you want gridlock.
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:32.880]  You don't want government that just can do whatever it wants.
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:36.240]  So the idea is if they fail to act, I'll do whatever I want.
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:42.160]  You're the executive that's given the laws to execute them.
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:49.520]  You're like an executive at a company with the shareholders, and the shareholders represent
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:51.520]  the population.
[03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:54.360]  And the Congress is the representative of the shareholders.
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:59.040]  The Congress makes law, and Congress is pretty much bought and paid for.
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:06.080]  I mean, they just gave the president the power to secretly arrest, torture, attack any country
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:07.080]  against.
[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:10.920]  You know, the biggest part of NDAA isn't just the bestiality weirdness and the rest of it.
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:15.520]  And if you just tuned in, yeah, it legalizes that too on a military basis.
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:18.320]  Look, I didn't believe it either when I heard it.
[03:03:18.320 --> 03:03:20.200]  Go look it up, I'm not joking.
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:24.120]  Believe me, we're living in Twilight Zone here.
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:27.920]  I mean, even if they're into that in the government, why put it in the law?
[03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:29.920]  I mean, it's just, they're crazy.
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:30.920]  They're crazy.
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:33.320]  These are crazy people.
[03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:35.980]  It's because they do what they do, but that's not the issue.
[03:03:35.980 --> 03:03:39.680]  The issue is that worldwide battlefield statement.
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:44.280]  And now they've got all these civilians dropping drone bombs, killing people, and now they
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:46.800]  say they're gonna have the drones operating on their own.
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:50.240]  No human killing people, that's already happening.
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:58.200]  And they give the drone operators medals and stuff, it's just beyond sickening.
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:03.480]  And all of this distance killing, all of this end of the conscience, end of critical thinking,
[03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:07.360]  we're gonna enter a new dark age of humankind that is gonna make anything we've seen look
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:09.360]  tame.
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:16.080]  We're living in a science fiction land, and again, it is all going to accelerate right
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:17.080]  now.
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:22.160]  And soon, we won't even be able to use computers in here, I won't be able to have a mouse.
[03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:26.000]  It's gonna have to face scan me and watch my eyes.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  They've had that for decades.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:30.840]  I remember when I was led into the University of Texas psychology department, all DARPA
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:33.520]  funded like 90% of it.
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:36.360]  And it was just all for control, just everything.
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:41.600]  They're studying every tiny minutia, integrating it with supercomputers, how to manipulate
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:42.600]  you.
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:47.340]  Monkeys with wires in their brains, testing the perfect flicker rate to mesmerize you.
[03:04:47.340 --> 03:04:52.320]  When you watch the blue mist in the background on Fox News, I mean, it's just total hell
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:57.400]  released by elitists who are willing to do anything to get life extension technologies
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:04:58.400]  and kill us.
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:00.840]  See you back tonight, seven o'clock, back Sunday.
