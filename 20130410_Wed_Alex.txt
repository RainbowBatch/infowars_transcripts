[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:32.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have had my amazing crew working until late last night.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  Kari Jackson, David Knight, Rob Dew, the amazing crew in here, Chris Alanis, and the rest of
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.840]  the crew, to bring you the information that we are gonna be breaking down here today.
[00:49.840 --> 00:57.920]  We're gonna analyze a Bloomberg gun confiscation rally, and just analyze the lies, the fraud,
[00:57.920 --> 01:03.560]  and show the mainstream media covering up the rally, saying that once they register
[01:03.560 --> 01:09.100]  our guns, they're going to confiscate them, because that's the blueprint. We've got them
[01:09.100 --> 01:13.200]  handing out the fake signs that the news then claims are grassroots.
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.160]  They point at the signs and say, look, it's grassroots. Once you know the formula, the
[01:18.160 --> 01:24.000]  man behind the curtain, it's so creepy that we've got a city councilman that looks like
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.320]  the Hispanic version of Dr. Evil. I mean, Mike Martinez, another one of these guys that
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.880]  was a city union head, Capitol Metro, light rail, scalping the citizens.
[01:36.880 --> 01:43.120]  And he says, listen, you guys got a sign out there saying, don't ban the guns. Well, guess
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.620]  what? We're not banning them today, but what we're doing today will let us get that done.
[01:47.620 --> 01:52.320]  So that sign, you'll need that soon. And this is a guy who hangs around with Bloomberg.
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.560]  The awesome police chief was up there with Biden on TV. I mean, he's like one of the
[01:56.560 --> 02:02.160]  main sellout police chiefs, cuz most of the sellout police chiefs can't even hardly talk.
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.080]  They just sit up there and get more obese and collect their paychecks.
[02:05.080 --> 02:12.440]  Art Acevedo is a slick guy, brought up by the feds out of California, federalizing LA.
[02:12.440 --> 02:17.420]  He's one of their inside operatives. And now he's taken over Austin and trying to shut
[02:17.420 --> 02:22.440]  down the gun shows, everything. And then he comes over and confronts our cameras and says,
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.640]  we're making stuff up.
[02:23.640 --> 02:29.120]  Nobody wants to confiscate guns. Hey, Acevedo, we got you, okay? And you say you wanna come
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.180]  in studio? I can't wait. Let's go ahead and play, though, Mike Martinez, the Bloomberg
[02:34.180 --> 02:40.120]  frontman, Mayor Pro Tem, saying hey, buddy, to a guy.
[02:40.120 --> 02:43.960]  You got a sign about banning guns? By the way, they were muscling him, cussing at him
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.240]  and bumping into him while he was there. And the police didn't go over, we have video of
[02:48.240 --> 02:54.920]  this, to the guys getting in his face, cussing at him and bumping him, the pro-gun guy.
[02:54.920 --> 03:08.160]  They go over and muscle on him with a sign. That's America. Let's go to the clip.
[03:08.160 --> 03:18.520]  Austin City Council member, Mike Martinez. Thank you so much. I've got a proclamation
[03:18.520 --> 03:21.760]  on the Afro-American City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple
[03:21.760 --> 03:27.840]  of words, and I'll be brief. First of all, to the gentlemen who's dying for attention,
[03:27.840 --> 03:34.040]  someone needs to inform them that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work
[03:34.040 --> 03:39.600]  we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly, so you hang on to
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.600]  that.
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.960]  So because of the work we're doing here today, we will make that sign legitimate shortly.
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.480]  We're gonna come back with my full report on that in the next segment, because I show
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.160]  clips of where they admit the plan is a total gun ban. Of course it is, Chicago, New York,
[03:56.160 --> 04:00.240]  every other country the globalists control, they armed to the teeth, paramilitary police,
[04:00.240 --> 04:08.800]  surveillance helicopters, drones, just total pre-crime, domestic tattle-tale brigades,
[04:08.800 --> 04:11.920]  I mean direct scripting of 1984.
[04:11.920 --> 04:19.720]  But as long as you call it liberal, it's A-OK. Now, the legislature of New York is calling
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.640]  for, and it's already happening, but they're calling for anyone who's ever been on any
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.680]  type of antidepressant drug period, which they basically forced the military on, will
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.060]  have your guns taken, that's linked up in the middle column under can wiener rise again.
[04:33.060 --> 04:37.360]  Police confiscating firearms from people, taking anti-anxiety medication, and then Time
[04:37.360 --> 04:42.040]  Magazine warning others about government oppression is anti-American crap. I thought it was the
[04:42.040 --> 04:47.440]  essence of America, and so I thought I'd dovetail that with all the real government oppression.
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.000]  And then we've got Jacquari Jackson in studio, along with David Knight, with their amazing
[04:52.000 --> 05:01.040]  footage analyzing a victim disarmament tyrant Bloomberg rally, analyzing the enemy.
[05:01.040 --> 05:05.040]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[05:05.040 --> 05:10.120]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.280]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[06:59.160 --> 07:05.880]  In the last 2 years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[07:05.880 --> 07:10.720]  and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.040]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[07:15.040 --> 07:19.520]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.

[08:03.520 --> 08:28.240]  from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[08:28.240 --> 08:41.200]  Throughout history, there have been many cases where authoritarians take the restraint of
[08:41.200 --> 08:49.920]  the armed population as weakness instead of restraint, especially by the real warrior
[08:49.920 --> 08:55.760]  class in this country, not the fake warrior class that likes to oppress men, women and
[08:55.760 --> 09:02.120]  children like North Korean soldiers. And the globalists are trying to convert America over
[09:02.120 --> 09:05.920]  to a system where the supposed warrior class does not protect the peace and defend the
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.700]  republic but instead ushers in the enslavement of the people.
[09:10.700 --> 09:15.560]  And by any historical yardstick, they had a major university study last year showing
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.680]  the United States the sixth worst police state in the world. Though the United States has
[09:20.680 --> 09:25.560]  a paradox because there's still so many time-honored basic liberties and freedoms that were hard
[09:25.560 --> 09:30.640]  won by the founders of this country and our veterans and others since then.
[09:30.640 --> 09:34.480]  There's always good and evil. There's always the control freaks. There's always the usurpers
[09:34.480 --> 09:38.920]  trying to take over. Just because they're always trying to take over because they live
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.420]  off our tax money. They live off the monopolies that they can create for big business. Just
[09:44.420 --> 09:48.680]  because they're always pushing, you don't give up. That's the eternal fight that every
[09:48.680 --> 09:52.340]  generation goes through.
[09:52.340 --> 09:57.080]  And this is gonna be an unprecedented broadcast today. It is a very important broadcast. We're
[09:57.080 --> 10:03.760]  gonna be focusing on the Second Amendment because the second wave since Obama's reelection
[10:03.760 --> 10:09.800]  of the attempt to butcher the Second Amendment is on right now. We are at a razor thin margin
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.040]  in the Senate with them being able to pass national gun registration, shutting down private
[10:16.040 --> 10:21.980]  sales, felonies if you give your son or daughter a gun or they give you a gun, all sorts of
[10:21.980 --> 10:23.800]  harassment.
[10:23.800 --> 10:30.320]  The ATF being able to shut down gun shops and factories via color of law. The enemy
[10:30.320 --> 10:40.040]  is coming in with their greatest assault ever and will probably provocateur or stage another
[10:40.040 --> 10:44.800]  mass shooting very, very soon. In one of the victim disarmament zones that they've created
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.960]  where no one can protect themselves and the children are trained to get in a fetal position
[10:48.960 --> 10:53.720]  to be executed to help the shooter get the maximum death rate while the SWAT team stands
[10:53.720 --> 10:58.600]  down outside so the mercenary group can exfiltrate out the back.
[10:58.600 --> 11:02.880]  Even if you catch them exfiltrating, it's in the video of it. Or even if the Department
[11:02.880 --> 11:13.000]  of Defense is running the shooter in Colorado, the general public just cannot get how criminal
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.200]  this operation is we're facing. This is a foreign banking takeover of America. And if
[11:19.200 --> 11:25.440]  you capture the United States completely, you've got all the drones, all the weapons,
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.720]  all the troops, all the aircraft carriers, all the cruise missiles, the new cruise missiles.
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.120]  The ICBMs are basically worthless folks, the new cruise missiles that are the ultimate
[11:35.120 --> 11:38.000]  weapon in the arsenal on the record.
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.280]  I mean, we are the big enchilada and they've got lots of collaborators, lots of arrogant
[11:44.280 --> 11:51.120]  egomaniac yes men that are ready to sell out and they really think they can win a protracted
[11:51.120 --> 11:55.920]  war. They really think you're gonna roll over and turn your guns in. Or they can just do
[11:55.920 --> 12:01.640]  like New York and 15 other states have done, start banning semi-autos, banning high capacity
[12:01.640 --> 12:07.440]  mags and then SWAT teaming and persecuting gun owners, veterans, setting up checkpoints
[12:07.440 --> 12:14.280]  on highways and doing knock and talks to catch gun owners with guns they haven't turned in
[12:14.280 --> 12:18.760]  to then fill the horrible private prisons with the patriots of America.
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.640]  It's not gonna work. Let me tell you what's gonna happen, okay? And it's already happening
[12:23.640 --> 12:29.800]  and they know this. You're gonna have cops dead all over the place. It's already happening.
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.040]  You're gonna have cops with people that are fed up when you try to take their guns. People
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.040]  aren't just gonna wait anymore in their house for you to come get the guns, okay?
[12:38.040 --> 12:42.640]  These are combat trained people. Everybody knows it, okay? And it's gonna start a civil
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.340]  war. And that's the plan. That's the false flag. And look, we've got now over 1,000 sheriffs
[12:48.340 --> 12:52.640]  coming out and saying it's tyranny, it's evil. So they introduced a bill that the Secret
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.720]  Service will have law enforcement power in the state of Colorado, they've introduced
[12:56.720 --> 12:59.840]  it in other states, to arrest sheriffs.
[12:59.840 --> 13:04.520]  That's civil war right there. But it's not even a civil war. The federal government has
[13:04.520 --> 13:09.240]  been taken over by foreign banks. The sheriffs in some of the states realize that. That's
[13:09.240 --> 13:13.840]  why you've got judges in Texas, state judges, county judges coming out and saying they're
[13:13.840 --> 13:15.280]  setting up martial law.
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.000]  They're preparing to take over a civil war before Obama got reelected. If you're not
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.440]  getting chills, you don't have a heartbeat out there, ladies and gentlemen. So all of
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.400]  this is going on, all of this is happening. And look at these headlines. I wanna show
[13:29.400 --> 13:37.320]  TV viewers this, radio listeners, go to infoawars.com. Time columnist warning others about government
[13:37.320 --> 13:39.680]  oppression is anti-American crap.
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.000]  That's a quote. There is no oppression, there is no tyranny. And of course, they now admit
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.840]  TSA on the streets, warrantless wiretapping, the police state, the persecution of patriots.
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.320]  But see, they're scared of talking about the 2 billion bullets, the armored vehicles, or
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.520]  the fact that, well, you want our guns while you're arming to the teeth?
[13:57.520 --> 14:04.160]  That's the elephant in the room. That's why they're selling 30 plus guns on the instant
[14:04.160 --> 14:09.400]  check registration system a minute. That's why they're having 70 million guns bought
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.160]  every two years now on record. It's more like 100 million, cuz it's over, folks. Don't you
[14:14.160 --> 14:15.160]  get it?
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.720]  This isn't Russia with a bunch of poor peasants that never had freedom under the czars. And
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.240]  then a bunch of commies come in and take over and just have a slaughterhouse. Not that the
[14:23.240 --> 14:26.200]  Russians aren't tough people, but they were always under bondage, so they never had a
[14:26.200 --> 14:30.360]  leg up. This is not Nazi Germany, which sure, the Germans were tough and smart, but they
[14:30.360 --> 14:31.800]  were subservient.
[14:31.800 --> 14:37.740]  It's a German thing to do what you're told, to get in line. This is not Nazi Germany.
[14:37.740 --> 14:42.440]  This is not the Chinese peasants who'd been under 5,000 years of tyranny. Strong, smart
[14:42.440 --> 14:48.160]  people, but always enslaved. This is America. This is the Republic, and you haven't chopped
[14:48.160 --> 14:52.360]  all of our huevos off. You haven't destroyed this country completely yet.
[14:52.360 --> 14:58.960]  There's over 100 million people who know who you are. This isn't just a republic, ladies
[14:58.960 --> 15:05.240]  and gentlemen. This is Sparta, if you wanna use the 300 analogy, but it's not 300. It's
[15:05.240 --> 15:13.200]  hundreds of thousands in every state who are sitting back, watching what's happening. And
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.920]  everything's being confirmed for them, and they are locked, and they are loaded.
[15:17.920 --> 15:21.680]  And I wanna tell the Federal Reserve and the New World Order something. You are not gonna
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.840]  get away with this. You may be able to kill Ron Paul, or kill Alex Jones, and wipe out
[15:26.840 --> 15:30.600]  the leadership. And the reason you haven't done that yet is because you know what that'll
[15:30.600 --> 15:31.600]  do.
[15:31.600 --> 15:40.160]  That'll energize us 110%, okay? We're powering up against your revolution against our republic.
[15:40.160 --> 15:44.120]  We're energizing, we're rising. That's why you desperately went for the guns. It's why
[15:44.120 --> 15:49.780]  you staged Aurora. It's why you staged Sandy Hook. It's your Gulf of Tonkin. You think
[15:49.780 --> 15:55.000]  you're gonna get away with this just because you've got space planes with DU Sabos, just
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.680]  because you've got cruise missiles?
[15:56.680 --> 16:04.000]  All that stuff is worthless against a population. Brzezinski's bemoaned it, your top tactician.
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  You are designed to take down states, you're not designed to take down ideas. You've tried
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.720]  to take men down, you've tried to balkanize America. If you watch MSNBC, that is New World
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.240]  Order, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, above the White House, it's panic zone.
[16:18.240 --> 16:21.600]  Everybody fight racially, attack white people. So blacks go out and attack whites all over
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.840]  the country, then they cover that up. But then they want whites scared to create division
[16:26.840 --> 16:28.520]  at the same time as well.
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.080]  They are hitting the panic button, ladies and gentlemen, for racial division, religious
[16:33.080 --> 16:39.200]  division. But listen, listen, that's why they're going after the guns right now, ladies and
[16:39.200 --> 16:45.120]  gentlemen, as a counter offensive because our offensive's winning. The big red one is
[16:45.120 --> 16:50.800]  rolling right into Germany, ladies and gentlemen, Battle of the Bulge. What was that, 1943,
[16:50.800 --> 16:51.800]  1944?
[16:51.800 --> 16:57.600]  They're rolling in and they're throwing everything they've got to stop us. They're already done.
[16:57.600 --> 17:04.200]  Their only hope is to convince you that you've lost. We have won. I know intellectually,
[17:04.200 --> 17:09.340]  I know historically, I know politically, I know with my street smarts, my whole life
[17:09.340 --> 17:13.080]  God's been training me. I wonder why all this horrible stuff happened to me growing up.
[17:13.080 --> 17:17.080]  My whole life was preparation for this, ladies and gentlemen. Your whole life was preparation
[17:17.080 --> 17:24.820]  for this. And we're not buying into this. We see it. We know it. We understand it. We
[17:24.820 --> 17:32.360]  know where it's going and we know the enemy. We know the enemy. We know the enemy. And
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.120]  they are a bunch of slime bags.
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.340]  They're not coming to take our guns. They're trying to steal our guns. They're not admitting
[17:38.340 --> 17:43.400]  they want our guns except on their own internal manuals when they slip up. They're coming
[17:43.400 --> 17:50.300]  to steal our guns. Mike Martinez, involved with the Bloomberg Group, the Austin police
[17:50.300 --> 17:58.640]  chief, high level now in the Obama administration. So slick that I told people privately here,
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.240]  Arne Savada, I said that that guy's history in helping him take over major police departments
[18:03.240 --> 18:09.100]  in LA. I believe that guy's probably deep cover fed. And he's got the nerve to come
[18:09.100 --> 18:11.320]  in here, I'll talk to him.
[18:11.320 --> 18:14.840]  And now he's up there not just with the other police chief, he's up there with Biden. He's
[18:14.840 --> 18:20.240]  up there with Obama. Up there is he's a good salesman going, we don't want your guns. All
[18:20.240 --> 18:24.360]  we want is to register them and to let if a psychiatrist says without any due process,
[18:24.360 --> 18:28.620]  take your guns. And then Martinez gets up and says, you see that guy with a sign over
[18:28.620 --> 18:33.400]  there who was silently standing there? So the people were bumping into him and cussing
[18:33.400 --> 18:34.400]  at him.
[18:34.400 --> 18:38.100]  We're gonna play the video up close of this with the cuss words beeped out. Then the police
[18:38.100 --> 18:43.120]  came over and got in on the Americans, on the citizens who were just there holding up
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.920]  their signs silently saying no gun ban. And Martinez says, hey, you that's dying for attention,
[18:48.920 --> 18:52.920]  implying they were causing the disturbance. While the police try to violate their First
[18:52.920 --> 18:56.640]  Amendment with pure in their little costumes, their little Captain Hook outfits.
[18:56.640 --> 19:00.760]  We're supposed to wear gold crowns, we bow down to you. And he says, we're gonna play
[19:00.760 --> 19:04.720]  this when we come back, the whole report. He points at him and he says, we're not taking
[19:04.720 --> 19:11.400]  your guns today. But he goes, what we're doing today, we will then get your guns. I'll make
[19:11.400 --> 19:12.400]  that sign legitimate.
[19:12.400 --> 19:17.360]  So you keep that sign, you're gonna need it. I mean, that's it. Imagine, it's not just
[19:17.360 --> 19:21.800]  that they wanna enslave us. They're not gonna enemy army landing saying we're here. No,
[19:21.800 --> 19:26.120]  it's like Cicero said, the Roman philosopher and historian. The enemy inside that doesn't
[19:26.120 --> 19:31.080]  come with a banner openly unfurled is the plague.
[19:31.080 --> 19:36.600]  And I mean, I've been around these people and I've seen them and they're crazed with
[19:36.600 --> 19:42.280]  the criminal energy. That's what it is to try to steal our Second Amendment and lie
[19:42.280 --> 19:47.880]  about it, with the criminal energy. And that's what makes me just like a dog when it sees
[19:47.880 --> 19:54.820]  a threat just instinctively because it's that energy, it's that evil energy.
[19:54.820 --> 20:00.440]  It's an evil energy. They are empowered with it rise against them.

[21:00.040 --> 21:05.580]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[21:05.580 --> 21:11.460]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[21:11.460 --> 21:14.800]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[21:14.800 --> 21:19.880]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[21:19.880 --> 21:24.440]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[21:24.440 --> 21:27.200]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[21:27.200 --> 21:31.480]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[21:31.480 --> 21:36.040]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're
[21:36.040 --> 21:39.480]  so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[21:39.480 --> 21:46.480]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV

[22:59.520 --> 23:05.000]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.760]  and floods raged across the US, costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[23:09.760 --> 23:14.160]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[23:14.160 --> 23:18.600]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[23:18.600 --> 23:23.560]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[23:23.560 --> 23:28.440]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability

[24:08.280 --> 24:16.080]  Now they want to divide us and demonize our liberties as if they're tyrannies. Ladies and
[24:16.080 --> 24:21.840]  gentlemen, here's the report on Mike Martinez, Austin City Council person, minion of Bloomberg
[24:21.840 --> 24:28.120]  with the police chief. And what you're seeing is treason against this republic. It is sedition,
[24:28.120 --> 24:32.000]  whether he knows it or not, and he shows his inner knowledge of we're going to get you
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.720]  registered, then we're going to confiscate. Here's the report.
[24:34.720 --> 24:45.200]  Austin City Council member Mike Martinez. Thank you so much. I've got a proclamation
[24:45.200 --> 24:48.320]  on the African American City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple
[24:48.320 --> 24:54.480]  of words, and I'll be brief. First of all, to the gentleman who's dying for attention,
[24:54.480 --> 25:00.720]  someone needs to inform them that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work
[25:00.720 --> 25:06.080]  that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly. So you hang
[25:06.080 --> 25:09.680]  on to that. Alex Jones here for Infowars Nightly News
[25:09.680 --> 25:16.520]  with a gun owner emergency alert. We sent our reporters out to the Texas Capitol here
[25:16.520 --> 25:24.920]  in Austin to film the Mayor Bloomberg sponsored event with the Austin police chief calling
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.480]  for the restriction of the second amendment, shutting down the gun shows, not having private
[25:29.480 --> 25:36.120]  sales, restricting quote high capacity magazines and city councilman Mike Martinez, who's set
[25:36.120 --> 25:43.240]  to be the next mayor, came out and pointed at a man in the audience who had a sign saying
[25:43.240 --> 25:49.000]  stop the gun ban. And he said, listen, buddy, you're trying to make attention yelling over
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.520]  there. We're gonna play the clip here in a moment. He says, that's not happening yet,
[25:53.520 --> 26:00.320]  but once we do this, that is going to happen to thunderous applause. Everywhere these collectivists
[26:00.320 --> 26:04.200]  have been in control, not just worldwide, but in Chicago, New York, and other areas,
[26:04.200 --> 26:11.000]  they've banned the guns, but first they register them. First they register them. And he says
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.560]  to him, Hey, we're not banning your guns right now. We're going to do what we're doing now,
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.440]  which is registration. And then we're going to take them. And that's what they've done
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.520]  everywhere. And that's, what's so frustrating about this. We have the clip of the attorney
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.920]  general back when he was deputy attorney general saying, we're going to brainwash the public
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.800]  against guns in the media. And what we need to do is change the way in which people think
[26:33.800 --> 26:37.840]  about guns, especially young people. One thing that I think is clear with young people and
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.900]  with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this. It's not enough
[26:41.900 --> 26:46.580]  to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday. We need to do
[26:46.580 --> 26:51.580]  this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[26:51.580 --> 26:56.520]  in a vastly different way. And then of course we have the clip of Diane Feinstein on 60
[26:56.520 --> 27:01.760]  minutes saying if she had the votes, Mr. And Mrs. America, turn in your semi-autos. If
[27:01.760 --> 27:10.000]  I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.960]  up every one of them, Mr. And Mrs. America, turn them all in. I would have done it.
[27:15.960 --> 27:19.600]  And after they've gotten those, they're going to take all the rest. The truth is they're
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.280]  buying millions of bullets. They're buying armored vehicles. This is an authoritarian
[27:24.280 --> 27:28.720]  takeover. And when Obama was a state Senator, he was for the total abolition of firearms
[27:28.720 --> 27:33.160]  ownership. The UN treaty they're trying to ratify right now in the Senate does the same
[27:33.160 --> 27:40.100]  thing and they admit it in our face. Even deep in the heart of Texas, Mr. Martinez gets
[27:40.100 --> 27:45.960]  up and says, basically, after we register your guns, we are going to confiscate them.
[27:45.960 --> 27:49.960]  I've got a proclamation on the African American city council that we want to present, but
[27:49.960 --> 27:54.960]  I want to say a couple of words and I'll be brief. First of all, to the gentleman that's
[27:54.960 --> 27:59.960]  paying a lot of attention, someone needs to inform them that there is no gun ban currently,
[27:59.960 --> 28:09.960]  but because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[28:09.960 --> 28:10.960]  So you hang on to that.
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.560]  Mexico has a total gun ban and has had 60,000 gun deaths the last six years because only
[28:15.560 --> 28:21.360]  the government and criminals have guns. This second amendment is a right of all Americans
[28:21.360 --> 28:26.640]  and it's despicable that these authoritarians creep around on the news and say, we just
[28:26.640 --> 28:32.880]  want reasonable restriction register when they're on record. All of them saying they
[28:32.880 --> 28:37.600]  plan to confiscate all our guns as part of a total government takeover of society. Please
[28:37.600 --> 28:40.720]  get this video out to everyone you know, because they want to act like they're being reasonable
[28:40.720 --> 28:46.000]  and Oh, it's no big deal. When on record, they really want to confiscate all our firearms.
[28:46.000 --> 28:52.440]  Alex Jones reporting for M4 Wars Nightly News.
[28:52.440 --> 28:59.760]  Yes, these men and their hypnotized followers follow this a new order. It is not new and
[28:59.760 --> 29:02.640]  it is not honor.
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, people like Mike Martinez and Mayor Bloomberg and others are conscious
[29:07.680 --> 29:12.680]  of the fact that it's about state control. He lives behind armed guards. He is behind
[29:12.680 --> 29:18.600]  incredible security at the huge edifice to government worship that is the Austin City
[29:18.600 --> 29:24.200]  Council. And they crave power. They crave uniforms and guns and they want your guns
[29:24.200 --> 29:27.200]  your right as a free human.
[29:27.200 --> 29:34.600]  I burn with a desire for liberty for North Korea and Mexico. I love those people. And
[29:34.600 --> 29:42.920]  I burn with defiance against Kim Jong Un and Mike Martinez. I burn with defiance and at
[29:42.920 --> 29:47.240]  least you're honest, though, that you do plan to confiscate our guns. In fact, I have more
[29:47.240 --> 29:49.800]  respect for you than I do for R&A Savannah.
[29:49.800 --> 30:02.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:03.400 --> 32:07.520]  into why, even though I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And
[32:07.520 --> 32:12.480]  my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[32:12.480 --> 32:17.640]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[32:17.640 --> 32:23.360]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[32:23.360 --> 32:29.120]  fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out
[32:29.120 --> 32:33.960]  there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the

[33:41.540 --> 33:47.280]  enemy is weak. That's why they creep around and lie and deceive. And then only in private
[33:47.280 --> 33:51.600]  moments that you get caught on C-SPAN, Sarah Brady more than 15 years ago saying we've
[33:51.600 --> 34:00.280]  got to get the registration before the confiscation before we can create a socialist America.
[34:00.280 --> 34:07.360]  That's a quote. And that's the battle plan. I mean, Bloomberg has taken all of the guns
[34:07.360 --> 34:14.640]  in New York. He is financing people to run for office to take guns in Texas. He is financing
[34:14.640 --> 34:22.040]  TV ads. He is taking Mike Martinez and the awesome police chief and, you know, flying
[34:22.040 --> 34:24.600]  them up to D.C., flying them up to New York.
[34:24.600 --> 34:29.240]  A lot of its taxpayer money paid for as well. While Bloomberg has at least 15 guards at
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.640]  any one time. And while all these guys have guns, there's R.J. Saaveda with a gun on his
[34:34.640 --> 34:41.440]  side at the Capitol that clearly holds 15 rounds, a Glock, maybe even more. And he's
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.200]  saying you shouldn't be able to have that when you've done nothing wrong.
[34:45.200 --> 34:48.560]  And he goes, you're either with us, the police or with the criminals. See, that's saying
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.120]  you do what we say or you're criminals. That's the psychology. He's giving exact White House
[34:53.120 --> 34:58.920]  talking points. And again, your mayor probably doing it in your town as well. Because that's
[34:58.920 --> 35:01.480]  what this is all about, total domination.
[35:01.480 --> 35:05.560]  And to have Mike Martinez up there, you know, make it a joke. Hey, we're not going to take
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.040]  your guns right now. We're going to take them after we finish the work we're doing today,
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.640]  which is not letting you have a gun that isn't registered. Not letting you buy a gun where
[35:15.640 --> 35:17.360]  it doesn't go through the database.
[35:17.360 --> 35:24.600]  And I've got a clip we're going to play later in the next hour. Adan Salazar did a report
[35:24.600 --> 35:30.800]  on it where CNN says that no guns are being taken in California from anyone. And they
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.120]  have Larry Pratt on the show. And the guy's sitting there going, we've never taken any
[35:35.120 --> 35:42.040]  guns. No one's taking your guns. And Larry Pratt didn't even know how to respond.
[35:42.040 --> 35:46.760]  So we're gonna be playing a clip of that. I mean, this is how crazy it's gotten with
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.760]  their incessant lying. And remember, their followers aren't really authoritarians. The
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.360]  minions really think that guns come out and kill children. These are people that have
[35:57.360 --> 36:02.120]  never been in a fistfight, never gone hunting, think being a man is a bad thing.
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.880]  The men are all beyond effeminate. The women are all these shrieking weirdos, anti-man
[36:07.880 --> 36:11.760]  feminist. I've been to these Million Mom March things, there'll be like 15 of them. They're
[36:11.760 --> 36:17.400]  all government people, all of them, all bureaucrats, all living off us. And they're just crazed
[36:17.400 --> 36:22.680]  eyed. They worship the state, they worship the uniform. Like when Buzz Bissinger said,
[36:22.680 --> 36:23.920]  we ought to kill Alex Jones.
[36:23.920 --> 36:29.000]  And here's more, he goes, yeah, I could wear my brother's uniform. Well, the ambassador's
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  daughter goes, you need to wear a uniform when you do it. I wanna be their baby. He
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.960]  goes, I could wear my brother's uniform. He's in the military. They're like, yeah, baby,
[36:38.960 --> 36:44.840]  yeah. Then Buzz Bissinger comes out and says, I've spent 600,000 on women's clothes, baby.
[36:44.840 --> 36:49.160]  I'm not kidding. This is who we're talking about. You're like, you're shocked by me wearing
[36:49.160 --> 36:50.160]  women's clothes.
[36:50.160 --> 36:57.040]  No, I don't care, buddy. I'm gonna be looking through my binoculars at nebulas and fish
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.440]  and ponds. I don't care if you shock me by wearing a dress. I'm trillions of light years
[37:02.440 --> 37:08.660]  ahead of you. That's why you're so afraid to die. It's why you're such a degenerate.
[37:08.660 --> 37:13.720]  It's why you're, because you're not tuned into everything. You're a joke. And I wanna
[37:13.720 --> 37:19.360]  tell Mike Martinez and Bloomberg and Feinstein and all of you something. I come from a good
[37:19.360 --> 37:20.360]  family.
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.360]  My listeners come from good people and real adversity. And we know the truth and we know
[37:26.360 --> 37:31.480]  what you are. And you may crave all the power cuddling up to the globalist, competing who
[37:31.480 --> 37:36.460]  can be the slimiest, who can deceive the best, who can get up there like a Pentecostal preacher
[37:36.460 --> 37:40.940]  and like a police chief going, nobody's gonna take your guns.
[37:40.940 --> 37:44.480]  We just want the psychiatrists to be able to do whatever they want. And you can't have
[37:44.480 --> 37:48.880]  high capacity mags. We're gonna arrest you for those. See, they don't tell you all that.
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.600]  It's all reasonable. We just don't want killers to get guns. Adam Lanza, who supposedly got
[37:54.600 --> 37:58.380]  the guns from his mother, who went through all these background checks and registry to
[37:58.380 --> 37:59.380]  get it.
[37:59.380 --> 38:04.560]  And so now they're just gonna ban those guns in Connecticut. What are you gonna ban? Exacto
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.700]  knives in this sick culture where every show is about a serial killer. Every show is about
[38:08.700 --> 38:14.480]  murder and death and all these weak people get into it and are fascinated by it. I always
[38:14.480 --> 38:17.040]  noticed they're just these arrested people.
[38:17.040 --> 38:24.220]  If you'd ever been around real violence, real death, you wouldn't think it was so cute anymore.
[38:24.220 --> 38:29.600]  Don't worry though, whatever civilizations visualize, they end up manifesting. And we're
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.000]  gonna manifest hell on earth because we've let the worst people get control and then
[38:34.000 --> 38:45.840]  sit there and lecture us and tell us that we are the ones responsible for the deaths
[38:45.840 --> 38:48.040]  of the children there.
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.280]  And they personalize those children. While hundreds of thousands get brain damaged every
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.840]  year, thousands die from the vaccines, the fluoride in the water. I mean, the tap water,
[38:56.840 --> 39:00.000]  you can almost light it on fire. In fact, it's lit on fire before in Houston. I mean,
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.600]  you're just drinking that, the cancer rate's going straight up.
[39:02.600 --> 39:06.800]  But none of that's personalized. None of that's brought out on the news. Unless it's, look
[39:06.800 --> 39:10.880]  at the cancer victim, the young child. Why are all the kids getting cancer? Gee, we don't
[39:10.880 --> 39:15.520]  know. Give money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they'll find a cure. By the way,
[39:15.520 --> 39:21.880]  here's a polio vaccine full of five or six different deadly cancer viruses that'll bond
[39:21.880 --> 39:24.920]  to your child's DNA with the RNA and kill them.
[39:24.920 --> 39:31.000]  How's that sound? I mean, this is the type of stuff we're talking about here. So I wanna
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.480]  go over some articles and then to this KHOU report. Because you just heard, and next hour
[39:36.480 --> 39:38.960]  got my reporters that we're gonna play more behind the scenes where they're handing out
[39:38.960 --> 39:42.680]  the fake signs to then say they were all grassroots.
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.600]  Where they're coming over and intimidating people saying they can't have a sign that's
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.440]  pro-gun and then blaming them saying they're disruptive. And the police chief coming over
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.760]  and saying, you tell Alex to get it straight and get his story straight. Nobody wants to
[39:55.760 --> 40:03.440]  take his guns. Yeah, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto, buddy boy.
[40:03.440 --> 40:08.680]  Don't you get it? I see you. You play your game, how there's no armored vehicles. By
[40:08.680 --> 40:14.520]  the way, guess who's on the Cap Metro board who authorized TSA? No other cities except
[40:14.520 --> 40:21.180]  New York, Chicago, LA, Detroit, collapsed globalist areas have TSA on the street.
[40:21.180 --> 40:25.760]  They now sneak them out so I can't go confront them. But every week they pop up somewhere
[40:25.760 --> 40:31.200]  downtown and just stop cars, go to buses, go to trains, dig through bags without warrants.
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.720]  Mike Martinez, they want the guns, folks. You know what you should be worried about?
[40:35.720 --> 40:38.600]  They've been told by the higher ups, you get those guns and you get them now. What do you
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.400]  think they've got planned? That they know that the drugged out, entertainment out America
[40:44.400 --> 40:45.400]  will wake up.
[40:45.400 --> 40:50.880]  That they know and are saying to the military, get ready for a civil war years ago. Gearing
[40:50.880 --> 40:54.400]  up spying on everybody, trying to find out what military will follow orders. They're
[40:54.400 --> 40:59.800]  running around like people on the deck of a sinking ship trying to get to lifeboats
[40:59.800 --> 41:01.440]  right now.
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.160]  Most of the elite are leaving and going to armored islands offshore. That's been reported
[41:05.160 --> 41:09.360]  on in mainstream news. They're acting like because they can't believe they're stealing
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.120]  85 billion a month, but they can't help themselves. They can't believe that they're killing thousands
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.460]  of babies a month that are already born in America by dehydrating them.
[41:17.460 --> 41:23.020]  They can't believe every hospital in the country that's government controlled is murdering
[41:23.020 --> 41:27.420]  people right now who are begging for water. You're like, well, that sounds a little radical.
[41:27.420 --> 41:32.640]  Look up the Wall Street Journal series, Wesley Smith on it. They can't believe they're getting
[41:32.640 --> 41:39.000]  away with this, so of course they're arming the wicked flee when none pursue.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.800]  Because they understand, they can calculate and go, the black uniforms don't intimidate
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.560]  them. We're flooding the borders wide open, bankrupting everything, but still they've
[41:47.560 --> 41:51.880]  got guns. Even if we vote to take them, they know we're tyrants. What do we do? And the
[41:51.880 --> 41:55.440]  elite are offshore giving their orders.
[41:55.440 --> 42:00.180]  You take care of them. You take care of them, Bloomberg. You take care of them, Mike Martinez.
[42:00.180 --> 42:06.320]  You take care of them. You take care of them. And all the police manuals. I was watching
[42:06.320 --> 42:09.960]  a Southern Poverty Law Center one last night. In fact, we may play it later, it's on YouTube
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.560]  and they're like, the police are like, you need to know these people are ready to die.
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.800]  They're not gonna turn their guns in. I'm the police chief of West Memphis, and they
[42:17.800 --> 42:22.880]  killed the other officer and my son, and they will kill you. So you gotta get after them.
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.120]  Yeah, that's what you need to do. Get after people that are willing to die. Start a fight
[42:27.120 --> 42:31.400]  with people that are, that went real well for the Mexican government in Mexico, didn't
[42:31.400 --> 42:32.400]  it?
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.200]  Who's got their clock completely cleaned by other cartels that want the money. They're
[42:36.200 --> 42:39.720]  like, hey, you think you can kill people, Mexican government? You think you're the El
[42:39.720 --> 42:44.880]  Jefe? We're the El Jefes cuz we worship the Grim Reaper. Well, you know who I worship?
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.400]  The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ. And that's who our founders worshiped,
[42:49.400 --> 42:52.480]  and they kicked the biggest empire's butt the world had ever seen that nobody could
[42:52.480 --> 42:53.480]  beat.
[42:53.480 --> 42:57.760]  And they lost almost every battle, but they persevered and were ready to die and ready
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.720]  to kill. And so they couldn't be beaten. The Iraqis, ladies and gentlemen, are known for
[43:02.720 --> 43:09.780]  their courage, but not for their shooting abilities, okay? That's a joke in the military.
[43:09.780 --> 43:15.600]  But the whole point is, 100,000 troops in Baghdad couldn't hold it, okay? So here's
[43:15.600 --> 43:18.960]  the deal. That's why you see Biden and all of them always talking about all the weapons
[43:18.960 --> 43:26.240]  they've got and how powerful they are, and you got Sharpton and Rangel saying, we got
[43:26.240 --> 43:27.240]  drones now.
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.280]  Forget your Second Amendment. Yeah, I know it's there to protect against a bad government.
[43:30.280 --> 43:35.320]  Doesn't matter, we got the drones now. Like, you're a part of the establishment up there,
[43:35.320 --> 43:41.160]  Al Sharpton. I wonder how many of your families died from vaccines they were given. Did you
[43:41.160 --> 43:44.360]  get a memo, Al, not to drink the Diet Coke or the tap water?
[43:44.360 --> 43:48.240]  The only time you mean something, the only time you become somebody, is when you join
[43:48.240 --> 43:55.640]  liberty and stop being a race-baiting pimp. But these people are defeated. They've already
[43:55.640 --> 43:59.280]  lost. If their system comes in, if the New World Order succeeds, population reductions
[43:59.280 --> 44:05.960]  of at least 80%. Bankrupted future. People like Mike Martinez are gonna have to look
[44:05.960 --> 44:07.680]  at the poverty around them.
[44:07.680 --> 44:11.460]  Don't you think all the el Jefes in Mexico who've strangled it for hundreds of years
[44:11.460 --> 44:15.680]  and not let their people ever get ahead, do you think they recognize how they've destroyed
[44:15.680 --> 44:20.180]  their own culture and are ensuring the destruction of their own progeny down the road? No, they're
[44:20.180 --> 44:24.800]  thinking about how they can dominate and shut people down now because watching other people
[44:24.800 --> 44:30.280]  be successful is a burr in their saddle.
[44:30.280 --> 44:34.640]  And so they think you're stupid. They're gonna creep around and say, we don't want your guns.
[44:34.640 --> 44:38.440]  That's a conspiracy theory. There's a new clip of Biden saying the black helicopter
[44:38.440 --> 44:42.860]  crowd thinks we want their guns. They're crazy. No, Biden, you just voted for the original
[44:42.860 --> 44:47.560]  assault weapons ban back in the early 90s that would confiscate all semi-autos.
[44:47.560 --> 44:51.260]  And Feinstein's on tape saying, if I could have gotten that bill, Mr. And Mrs. America
[44:51.260 --> 44:57.640]  turn them all in. And then they'll take all the others like they always do. So let me
[44:57.640 --> 45:04.000]  show you some articles here. Here it is. Columnist, time columnist warning others about government
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.900]  oppression is anti-government crap.
[45:05.900 --> 45:11.120]  It doesn't exist. Klein supports democide, but says you are paranoid if you question
[45:11.120 --> 45:15.840]  government. That's right. It's anti-American to question government. That's of course 180
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.160]  degrees the opposite direction. DHS contractor apologizes for selling shooting targets of
[45:20.160 --> 45:25.400]  children. DHS paid them 2 million for targets of five-year-old children and pregnant women
[45:25.400 --> 45:27.280]  to target them to kill them.
[45:27.280 --> 45:32.980]  Remember that? Here's Forbes. How the US military would crush a Tea Party rebellion. Another
[45:32.980 --> 45:38.320]  sheriff has come out with their internal training the feds gave them, where it's all about crushing
[45:38.320 --> 45:44.160]  patriots and sheriffs. And they tell the sheriffs in these meetings the feds do, we know a lot
[45:44.160 --> 45:47.060]  of you are with the rebellion and we're gonna get you.
[45:47.060 --> 45:51.400]  That's a new article by Kurt Nemo. I told you cops when you go to this you're being
[45:51.400 --> 45:58.040]  assessed by an offshore bank mercenary. That's not Alex Jones rhetoric. That is 100% Veritas
[45:58.040 --> 46:03.760]  being directly to you. That's why the enemy with their fake means all day says I'm not
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.280]  real hoping you don't go check into what I'm saying to find out it's real.
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.160]  Because the fact that I'm real gives you aid and comfort that you're real and we give each
[46:11.160 --> 46:16.920]  other strength to stand against this enemy. That's why they can't have anybody believe
[46:16.920 --> 46:23.480]  Alex Jones isn't New World Order or isn't CIA or isn't with the Koch brothers or any
[46:23.480 --> 46:28.920]  of this bull. They have to do that. The spirit of evil has to do that because it can't ever
[46:28.920 --> 46:32.260]  let anybody know there's other real souls out there.
[46:32.260 --> 46:36.840]  But you know your soul's real. You know you're good. You know liberty beats in your breast.
[46:36.840 --> 46:40.880]  You know when tyrants menace you, it makes you angry. It makes you wanna resist them.
[46:40.880 --> 46:44.280]  You know you're not a coward. You know you have the animating spirit of liberty in your
[46:44.280 --> 46:51.320]  heart and soul and mind. You feel the presence of God. These people run from you. They want
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.440]  you dead. All those that hate me love death.
[46:56.440 --> 47:03.020]  How the military would crush a Tea Party rebellion, bullets for kids, training manuals, Homeland
[47:03.020 --> 47:08.480]  Security Youth Brigades. Look at this, DHS funded course ask cops if they will confiscate
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.880]  guns from Christians. Colorado troopers trained to consider Christians as dangerous terrorists.
[47:13.880 --> 47:17.120]  Don't believe kurtnetoninfallworks.com or the sheriff or the troopers that have gone
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.340]  public in this article. Look right here. Army labeled evangelicals and religious groups
[47:22.340 --> 47:27.200]  as extremists, including all Catholics, all evangelicals, Fox News.
[47:27.200 --> 47:33.440]  They had Baptist preachers at this anti gun rally in Austin invoking, using the deep Luciferian
[47:33.440 --> 47:39.480]  terms for Lucifer. We got that clip coming soon too. Ladies and gentlemen, the enemy
[47:39.480 --> 47:44.640]  is making its move as a desperate Battle of the Bulge counter offensive against us.
[47:44.640 --> 47:47.760]  You need to understand, you need to understand they're going for everything right now and
[47:47.760 --> 47:51.480]  this is their moment of danger. And that's why they're hoaxing and losing all their credibility.
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.120]  It doesn't matter. Once they set off a nuke or something and bring in martial law, they
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.940]  plan on trying to arrest us. They need to get the troops and military ready to go out
[47:58.940 --> 48:00.960]  in phalanxes against us.
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.860]  That's why you've got to emergency transmit now. They're gonna take over the cell phones,
[48:04.860 --> 48:12.140]  the data, all of it pumping government bull once they drop the hammer. But take heart
[48:12.140 --> 48:16.800]  ladies and gentlemen, the only future is resisting them. And if they think with their actuaries
[48:16.800 --> 48:20.560]  and computer programs, they're not gonna win, they'll back off. Now I wanna go to this KHOU
[48:20.560 --> 48:21.560]  piece.
[48:21.560 --> 48:28.100]  You just heard the unedited tape where the city councilman said he's gonna get our guns
[48:28.100 --> 48:32.200]  after he registers them. Then they show Martinez, they go, no one's gonna take your guns and
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.880]  Martinez said so. And the Houston TV station cuts to him saying no one's gonna take your
[48:36.880 --> 48:43.040]  guns. Imagine the psyops and they imply the pro gun people were causing trouble when it
[48:43.040 --> 48:44.040]  was the other way around.
[48:44.040 --> 48:46.000]  Here's that clip.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.720]  Rally for tougher gun laws becomes a heated debate when gun rights advocates bring a message
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.760]  of their own. Then I beat Shannon Murray's live at the state Capitol with our top story.
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.280]  Jade, that's right, about 100 people showed up at the Capitol today for the Texas rally
[49:01.280 --> 49:06.040]  for gun sense. And although they were briefly interrupted by gun rights activists, organizers
[49:06.040 --> 49:08.960]  of the rally say that their message today is not about banning-
[49:08.960 --> 49:12.000]  They were not interrupted? Oh, it's not about guns.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.320]  Dozens of demonstrators fighting for stricter gun laws.
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.000]  We talk a lot about this issue. We need to do something about it.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.360]  Dozens of bureaucrats want your guns.
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.380]  Among the speakers at Saturday's rally, people whose lives have been touched by gun violence.
[49:26.380 --> 49:30.720]  She could have fought him off. She would have won if he hadn't had the gun.
[49:30.720 --> 49:31.720]  Her daughter should have had a gun.
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.400]  Universal background checks limiting assault weapons and high capacity magazines, and they
[49:36.400 --> 49:39.120]  oppose bringing any guns on a school campus.
[49:39.120 --> 49:42.840]  I used to just be a mom and now I'm a mom and an activist.
[49:42.840 --> 49:45.120]  Hillary Rand is with Moms Demand Action.
[49:45.120 --> 49:49.080]  Yeah, make sure the schools are shooting clubs for psycos.
[49:49.080 --> 49:53.160]  I couldn't go on with daily life without trying to make things better.
[49:53.160 --> 49:54.160]  Neither can we.
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.600]  Two gun rights activists interrupted the rally, bringing their own message front and center.
[49:57.600 --> 50:01.600]  I'm all for stopping crime, but I'm a big supporter of this.
[50:01.600 --> 50:02.600]  Hit pause right there.
[50:02.600 --> 50:07.240]  We're gonna go to break. Back it up. They keep saying they interrupted, they interrupted.
[50:07.240 --> 50:11.320]  These guys, we have all the footage. Totally calm, standing there, all of their signs.
[50:11.320 --> 50:14.200]  They come over, cuss at them, push on them. The police come over.
[50:14.200 --> 50:19.160]  And the don't worry though, the media will cover up for you and say that the pro-gunners
[50:19.160 --> 50:20.160]  were bad.
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.760]  And we come back, R.J. Seveda is up there doing his preacher bit. We don't want your
[50:25.760 --> 50:30.560]  guns. And then they go, see, even Martinez says nobody wants your guns. And then they
[50:30.560 --> 50:35.240]  cut to him saying, that sign's gonna be needed and legitimate soon, cuz we're coming for
[50:35.240 --> 50:36.240]  your guns.
[50:36.240 --> 50:40.360]  But they trim it down, and that's all part, that's KVUE, but it also aired in Houston.
[50:40.360 --> 50:46.720]  That's why I originally got it from Houston. That's a local Austin station sitting there
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.180]  showing how masterful they are. Cuz if you show you can lie better, maybe you'll get
[50:50.180 --> 50:51.920]  a job in New York.
[50:51.920 --> 50:55.800]  But taking the truth of them saying we're gonna get your guns after we register them,
[50:55.800 --> 51:00.480]  just saying no one wants your guns, and the pro-gun people caused a disturbance, bad boys.
[51:00.480 --> 51:04.600]  American gardeners and fellow patriots, make the right choice with your money, time, and

[51:59.480 --> 52:04.160]  Gardeners, here comes another growing season, but don't use last year's soil.
[52:04.160 --> 52:07.680]  Maximize yields in your survival garden with EM-1 from Tereganics.
[52:07.680 --> 52:12.080]  EM-1 is an organic soil conditioner, fertilizer amendment, and compost accelerant that provides
[52:12.080 --> 52:16.600]  a broad spectrum of beneficial microorganisms, enzymes, trace minerals, vitamins, and various
[52:16.600 --> 52:17.840]  organic acids.
[52:17.840 --> 52:22.120]  EM-1 helps regulate the soil's pH level and its soil microbes, improving moisture retention
[52:22.120 --> 52:23.200]  and drought tolerance.
[52:23.200 --> 52:25.080]  Remember last year's dry conditions?
[52:25.080 --> 52:30.000]  EM-1 from Tereganics is safe, chemical free, and certified for use on all organic farms.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.720]  It improves plant quality, size, color, flavor, and gives up to 20% more nutrient value in

[52:54.080 --> 52:56.080]  That's 866-369-3678.
[52:56.080 --> 53:00.520]  Tereganics, life's getting better.
[53:00.520 --> 53:02.920]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[53:02.920 --> 53:06.440]  We have an alarm system, and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[53:06.440 --> 53:10.160]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[53:10.160 --> 53:15.160]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry,
[53:15.160 --> 53:16.160]  and my guns.
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.160]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[53:19.160 --> 53:24.040]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that
[53:24.040 --> 53:26.720]  deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[53:26.720 --> 53:31.080]  The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually
[53:31.080 --> 53:32.760]  stop an intruder.
[53:32.760 --> 53:37.760]  Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent
[53:37.760 --> 53:38.760]  kick-ins.
[53:38.760 --> 53:44.720]  I was surprised at how little Easy Armor costs, and I installed Easy Armor in about 30 minutes.
[53:44.720 --> 53:46.480]  Visit easyarmor.net.
[53:46.480 --> 53:51.840]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R dot net, or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[53:51.840 --> 54:20.760]  That's 888-582-7667, easyarmor.net, ultimate door security made easy.
[54:22.760 --> 54:26.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and we're gonna have my two reporters with us
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.640]  with breaking news and really showing the manufactured consent that goes on in an anti-gun
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.880]  victim disarmament, foreign banker-funded collaborator meeting.
[54:35.880 --> 54:36.880]  That's what it is.
[54:36.880 --> 54:38.620]  I mean, we're sitting here watching history happen.
[54:38.620 --> 54:42.920]  People always think of the tyrant that looks like Hitler or Stalin that came before, or
[54:42.920 --> 54:43.920]  Napoleon.
[54:43.920 --> 54:46.120]  You know, 30 years later, you're looking for a guy that looks like Napoleon.
[54:46.120 --> 54:48.920]  But every new tyrant, every new attack looks different.
[54:48.920 --> 54:53.400]  But it's always the same about enslaving and taking control of the society.
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.400]  And that's what it is.
[54:54.400 --> 54:57.480]  The governing class and the corporations that have grown up around it, they want us enslaved.
[54:57.480 --> 55:00.980]  Briefly, if you believe in what we're doing and wanna get the word out, go to info war
[55:00.980 --> 55:01.980]  store dot com.
[55:01.980 --> 55:03.180]  We've got a new t-shirt.
[55:03.180 --> 55:06.600]  We have the AK-47 with the keep and bear arms inside of it.
[55:06.600 --> 55:07.600]  Come and take it.
[55:07.600 --> 55:13.280]  Now we have that as well, but an M-16 with the Second Amendment inside of it and the
[55:13.280 --> 55:14.280]  come and take it.
[55:14.280 --> 55:15.880]  And it's red, white, and blue.
[55:15.880 --> 55:18.960]  And that helps get the word out and support the broadcast.
[55:18.960 --> 55:22.760]  And I see the t-shirts all over the country, not just here in Austin, Texas now.
[55:22.760 --> 55:26.500]  So good job, everybody supporting us and supporting freedom by getting these t-shirts.
[55:26.500 --> 55:29.500]  The pro pure water filter is 10% off of promo code water.
[55:29.500 --> 55:31.760]  Lowest price out there on the best systems available, period.
[55:31.760 --> 55:39.320]  Look at the side by side comparisons at info war store.com or call toll free to talk to
[55:39.320 --> 55:43.500]  our crew and operators 888-253-3139.
[55:43.500 --> 55:46.180]  So if you just tuned in, we're gonna play this in the next hour again.
[55:46.180 --> 55:50.440]  Mike Martinez, part of the Bloomberg crew with the police chief in Austin who's up with
[55:50.440 --> 55:53.380]  Obama right now calling for restrictions.
[55:53.380 --> 55:55.920]  So these are globalist operatives here.
[55:55.920 --> 56:01.360]  They are openly saying, look, the pro gunners disrupted us and we're gonna show you the
[56:01.360 --> 56:02.640]  truth.
[56:02.640 --> 56:08.320]  And we don't wanna take your guns and the news media even shows the clip where he admits
[56:08.320 --> 56:10.820]  after we register, we're gonna try to confiscate.
[56:10.820 --> 56:13.120]  So yeah, we are coming for your guns.
[56:13.120 --> 56:15.760]  But then they cut to it and act like he never said that.
[56:15.760 --> 56:18.180]  So here is the rest.
[56:18.180 --> 56:21.840]  It's on the KHOU website, but I guess it's from KVUE here in Austin.
[56:21.840 --> 56:22.840]  Here it is.
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.920]  Formed after the school shooting in Connecticut.
[56:24.920 --> 56:29.080]  I couldn't go on with daily life without trying to make things better.
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.440]  Two gun rights activists interrupted the rally bringing their own message front and center.
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.760]  I'm all for stopping crime, but I'm a big supporter of the second amendment.
[56:37.760 --> 56:38.760]  He disrupted nothing.
[56:38.760 --> 56:40.880]  It's a cornerstone of our freedom.
[56:40.880 --> 56:46.000]  This activist who goes by Texas George says he does not believe more gun control is the
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  answer.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.760]  All that does is give a law abiding citizen a disadvantage.
[56:49.760 --> 56:52.560]  The crowd quickly stood up and tried to block their signs.
[56:52.560 --> 56:53.840]  Law enforcement even stepped in.
[56:53.840 --> 56:55.400]  Law enforcement.
[56:55.400 --> 57:01.200]  It's time to speak up against people who are perpetrating things that just aren't true.
[57:01.200 --> 57:02.200]  Perpetrating?
[57:02.200 --> 57:03.200]  No one wants to ban guns here.
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.480]  Austin city councilman Mike Martinez even addressed the two men saying the message on
[57:07.480 --> 57:09.120]  their sign is incorrect.
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.320]  We will make your sign legitimate shortly and you can hang on and out.
[57:14.320 --> 57:15.320]  That's enough.
[57:15.320 --> 57:16.680]  We'll play more later to show the lie with the report.
[57:16.680 --> 57:20.360]  We've got about a minute and a half, Sha'Carri Jackson, David Knight, you were at this rally
[57:20.360 --> 57:21.800]  a few days ago.
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.240]  What is it like to see the media spin like that and lie like that?
[57:25.240 --> 57:26.880]  I thought it was incredible.
[57:26.880 --> 57:28.280]  That's my first time seeing that clip.
[57:28.280 --> 57:30.320]  I didn't know that they had that type of spin on it.
[57:30.320 --> 57:35.040]  Because if you show the whole clip, which we do here at Info Wars, you clearly see the
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.400]  guys out there peacefully protesting silently for the most part.
[57:38.400 --> 57:42.160]  Now the taller gentleman who was with him when Martinez addressed him, he addressed
[57:42.160 --> 57:43.160]  Martinez back.
[57:43.160 --> 57:47.480]  And I do believe we have a clip we'll show our viewers here in a little bit where a guy
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.760]  started cussing and yelling at the two guys who were standing peacefully with their sign.
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.200]  But the media spin is they were out there interrupting and barging in on this protest
[57:57.200 --> 57:59.200]  when they were doing nothing of the sort.
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.280]  What about saying no one wants to take your guns when Martinez basically said, yeah, we're
[58:03.280 --> 58:05.360]  gonna register now and then get them.
[58:05.360 --> 58:06.360]  You'll need that sign.
[58:06.360 --> 58:11.160]  Oh yeah, just like the lady said, they show the lady and maybe that was her view.
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.480]  But they show the clip of Martinez was saying, yes, I'm gonna take your guns and you're gonna
[58:15.480 --> 58:17.560]  need that sign very soon because we're gonna take your guns.
[58:17.560 --> 58:21.840]  Well, they edited his comments to make it sound that way.
[58:21.840 --> 58:22.840]  It's just incredible.
[58:22.840 --> 58:26.640]  Yeah, no, no, no one wants your guns and then they spin the Martinez clip to deceive their
[58:26.640 --> 58:27.640]  viewers.
[58:27.640 --> 58:30.120]  I mean, you guys work in news.
[58:30.120 --> 58:32.320]  They had to work to be deceptive.
[58:32.320 --> 58:34.840]  We try to tell the truth.
[58:34.840 --> 58:37.640]  So much work went into that, folks, because they think you're an idiot.
[58:37.640 --> 58:39.640]  They're an enemy operation.
[58:39.640 --> 58:50.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:23.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:35.560]  All right folks, I've got my reporters David Knight and Sha'Carri Jackson in studio with
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]  us.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.440]  I know that XM and some other stations join us in the first hour, but also in the second
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]  and third.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.480]  Some of our reporters are joining us now.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.600]  And gentlemen, how would you recap for people that just tuned in, the state of the all-out
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.400]  war on the Second Amendment and then watching the microcosm of how the Bloomberg, Wall Street,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.040]  it's the corporations trying to take our guns so they can get all the corporate welfare.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.720]  Watching the Bloomberg machine here in Austin is a microcosm for the rest of the country
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.300]  and the solid wall of deception.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.840]  And then Martinez gets off script, the mayor proteum and says, well, we're gonna register
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.000]  now, then we'll get your guns later.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  David Knight?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.760]  There's a lot of deception with this.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.640]  The whole thing is based on deception and saying, if you believe this, you're a conspiracy
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.920]  theorist and you're paranoid.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.520]  But when you really scratch them, when you get them really upset, when you get them fired
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.600]  up, they say something like Martinez did.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.860]  And what you can see with this crowd shot that we've got there is something that's exactly
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.160]  the opposite of what KHOU had.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:35.160]  KHOU was saying that it was these two Second Amendment activists who were disrupting the
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.320]  crowd, but they were just silently standing there.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.480]  And it was the crowd that was crowding around them and holding signs in front of them and
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.480]  in back of them.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.680]  We got a clip of that.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.200]  And we got a clip of the guy talking, he was very calm.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.800]  And it was a guy in the back that started screaming profanities in a really loud voice.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.160]  And at that point, Arcevado and the other cops converged on these two guys, and they
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160]  were watching them.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.160]  They weren't watching to protect them from the other crowd.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.980]  And this has happened to me, and this whole Bloomberg group is just all under globalist
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.480]  control and city control.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.800]  It's happened to me all over the country where they have somebody come over and yell and
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.400]  scream, and then the cops come in on you, and then later you see that person leave with
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400]  them.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.120]  Well, it's very telling because you have Bloomberg with his demand to plan, and these are moms
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.440]  who demand an action.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.200]  I mean, it's all coming from the same people, it's the same attitude, and it's the nanny
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200]  state.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.200]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the man, Adolf Hitler.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.000]  They're making demands on us, and it's the nanny state, this kind of nanny attitude.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.680]  And of course, they're gonna be natural allies with moms who are gonna kind of fit into that
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]  whole nanny state thing.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.560]  Well, there's another nanny, they're called house slaves.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.560]  Yeah.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.560]  No, that's the Roman model.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.800]  I mean, I've got the manuals.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  These are house slaves.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.840]  They're there, the government's their buddy, and they're gonna tell the men what to do.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840]  Right, right, right.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.440]  I mean, the Bible says the ultimate tyranny, women will be set on top of you, and that's
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.440]  what this is.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440]  Nothing against women.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.120]  The women get totally enslaved in it.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:57.080]  Look at where women are in this society, totally depressed, pure sex objects now, the opposite
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.640]  of what they claim they didn't want to be.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.920]  Jakar, we're going to break.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.800]  Tell us about some of the clips we've got coming up, the great crews in there running.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.400]  Well, coming up, we have the clip David was just alluding to where the crowd starts yelling
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.380]  at the two guys who were peacefully protesting and Acevedo and some other police officers
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.380]  come in.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:18.100]  And also, we'll show you some crowd comparisons to this most recent Moms Demand action rally
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.100]  versus some of the other ones.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.000]  That is banker, collaborators demand we be their slaves.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.360]  Yeah, they're saying that they don't want your guns, but when Martina says, yeah, we're
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.120]  gonna take your guns, everybody starts cheering and clapping.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.400]  And we have more, we have Acevedo's view on registration and Acevedo also criticizing
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.400]  constitutional sheriffs.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.140]  I think that's gonna be a- But and then after we do that, we'll play
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.040]  Biden saying, the Secret Service is coming to get you.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.760]  The bill says they'll have law enforcement power in the states and go after people, sheriffs
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.040]  that don't do what they're told.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.200]  And then they just hope you don't, in fact, I had that yesterday stack.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.760]  Can somebody from the crew get me the article about, I think it was a Kurt Nemo article,
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.760]  Secret Service Prepares.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.560]  I think it was Colorado up in arms over bill to send Secret Service after sheriffs, and
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.120]  the sheriffs are speaking up.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.440]  It's Hickenlooper in Colorado, Governor Hickenlooper is pushing, yeah, is on the side of that bill.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.520]  But I mean, what do you call that when they just lie about everything?
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.960]  Deception, that's the only term I could come up to describe that.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960]  Well, it's propaganda.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.360]  It's the sort of thing where you tell, it doesn't matter what you say as long as you
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.640]  repeat it enough and loudly enough, and you ridicule the other side.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.000]  Well, that's another Hitler quote.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.640]  Yeah, right, right.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.440]  So it doesn't matter that we'd link to the documents, right?
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.240]  Doesn't matter it's on the federal government's own site, doesn't matter it's a bill being
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.960]  debated in Colorado, Biden gets up and goes, that doesn't exist.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.880]  They did the same thing the mom said, they hold their signs up in front of it to say
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880]  something else.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.800]  Well, the same thing they did to the Second Amendment.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.960]  Well, they yell at you and bump into you, then the cops come over onto you.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.960]  Right.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960]  Pretty much, yeah.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.160]  Can you imagine how they're going to act once they get our guns?
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.560]  I mean, they're literally going to have us in slave camps.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560]  They've said they are.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:00.520]  In fact, we have the city councilman saying, well, get your guns after registration.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.440]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.560]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.600]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600]  to the global takeover.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:21.600]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com.

[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.560]  Well so does he.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:24.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:31.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, a full out, total 360 degree attack is going on in the entire Bill
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.800]  of Rights.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.960]  States' rights, First Amendment, Second Amendment, they're arresting people all over the country
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.440]  for filming police in public, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years in jail, 85 billion a month
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.440]  to foreign banks.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.480]  They can't believe they've gotten away with this and now they're going full tilt boogie
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.880]  just using the 20 dead children, ignoring medical neglect, killing hundreds of thousands
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.920]  a year, all the rest of it.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.400]  The drones killing hundreds of children a week and just saying it's your fault gun owners,
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.880]  you need to give us your guns and just be reasonable.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.280]  We don't want your guns, even though everywhere we get control after we register we do take
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.280]  them.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.400]  I mean look at New York, they've taken everybody's guns, Chicago, look at Europe.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.040]  It's the same plan, register then confiscate.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.360]  And city councilman Mike Martinez, Mayor Protean, fast tracked with Bloomberg just like our
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.960]  police chief who was there with him, if you're listening around the country, yesterday press
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.080]  conferences with Biden.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.600]  I mean he's up there talking folks, he's not just a police chief behind him because he
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.600]  is slick.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.080]  I've said privately either this guy is a silver tongue psychopath or he's actually a good
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.280]  guy but I said I think he's a bad guy.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.320]  And I've said that, I've even told him that in the hallway and he's like, no, I'm not,
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.640]  I came from Cuba in tyranny, I don't want to live under it.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:51.120]  But the fact is Ace Aveda knows what he's doing and he may have lied to himself or whatever,
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.680]  well this is the way it's going, I'll just go along with it.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.360]  But my crew was there and this is a guy being brought in by Bloomberg, really to be one
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.720]  of the main spokesman against us now.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.720]  Because Austin is a key city, ladies and gentlemen, fastest growing, wealthiest in the country
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.880]  per capita.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.480]  The heart of Texas, it's part of the UN agenda 21, they call it the tri-city map to take
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.720]  over the state via Austin, it's the capital.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:19.080]  And this video, I'm gonna have our reporters break it down as we've got eight clips here
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.880]  and eight different angles of deception.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.320]  But David Knight who was there with Sha'Carri Jackson, this was this weekend and we finally
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.720]  got around to looking at the footage a few days ago as the guy's been busy with other
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720]  news.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.120]  Break down, well first let's play the clip and then we'll get David Knight and Sha'Carri
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.940]  Jackson's take on it and then walk through these other clips.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:41.880]  But here is the Austin city council member to a guy that has a sign for new listeners
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.080]  saying stop gun ban.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.920]  And he says, hey, we're not gonna ban guns right now, this is not an assault, this is
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.840]  not a tat offensive.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.800]  Don't run, we are your friends, this is not an assault at the Waco compound.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:59.040]  But after we do this, which is gun registration, you will need that sign because we are gonna
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.000]  do that, you'll need that sign to which the crowd roars.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.760]  And Martinez has already said, shut down the gun shows, ban the guns before.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.400]  So this is their plan, they say it all the time, but then they tell you, that's not our
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  plan.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.380]  So they're not trying to take our rights or trying to steal them under the radar, which
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.120]  just shows the despicable nature.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.840]  But Martinez love to brag, who loves to brag, scum.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.040]  They always love to tell you, and it's just like in the cartoons with a bad guy, you know
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.640]  what I'm gonna do to you now?
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.120]  And they give the plan, that's really how it works, it's in criminology.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.240]  Now let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:47.960]  Thank you so much, I've got a proclamation on the African American City Council that
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960]  we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.160]  First of all, to the gentleman who's dying for attention, someone needs to inform them
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.160]  that there is no gun ban currently.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:02.480]  But because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.040]  So you hang on to that.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.520]  All right, and there's the thunderous jones here for applause, and then it goes into the
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.920]  rest of my report showing more of them saying it.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.320]  You can go to infoawars.com and see all of our articles, you can also go to drudgereport.com.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.920]  We're in New York, they're now announcing, they're going after everyone who's ever been
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:26.300]  on any type of anti-depression meds or meds, period, that are seen as anti-anxiety.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.220]  And this is how it is, get you in the system, then declare you mentally defunct.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.600]  It's happening to the veterans, it's gonna happen to everybody now.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.720]  This is the full authoritarian takeover to persecute gun owners and libertarians.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.600]  Okay, guys, Jakari Jackson, David Knight, walk through these clips, you've got the floor.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.520]  Well, we've got a couple of things here.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.000]  First to kind of talk about the crowd, we're gonna talk about what Acevedo said when he
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.840]  attacked constitutional sheriffs and when he talks about, are we on the slippery slope
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840]  with registration?
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.280]  We've got a couple of clips about that.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.160]  But first we want to show the crowd, so let's throw this first clip here, showing what really
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:21.240]  happened with that Second Amendment supporter there at that crowd.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:49.720]  He's saying, F-U-F-U, that guy right there.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.720]  He is the instigator.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.720]  I've seen him before.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.840]  Yeah, I've had, these are all.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.160]  This is Acevedo comes down, he gets around them, and now you'll see the police converge
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.160]  on these guys.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.760]  Look at Acevedo bugging his eyes out.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.480]  Look at this, as he moves from one side to the other.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.120]  They're trying to cover his side.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.120]  Front and back.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.600]  And they say that's the guy who's interrupting.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:19.680]  No, I mean, they physically assault him, I mean, that lady really kind of a punch, boom.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.680]  You know how one little peck at you?
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.680]  That was a peck right there.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.760]  She came in with a little pecker and pecked him.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.360]  The cops right there.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.680]  Boy, that guy looks tough, that pro-gun guy.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.400]  Yeah, so you saw the guy.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.200]  These idiots have no idea, cuz they're not gonna stop, they're already announcing our
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.200]  kids are theirs.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.760]  They just want a war, I tell you, they're gonna get it too.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]  Exactly.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.800]  I mean, I'm telling you, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.760]  You saw the two guys, the pro-gun guys, were out there peacefully protesting.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.400]  Now when Martinez addressed them, they addressed Martinez back.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.460]  And then you saw the younger guy behind them started yelling and cussing, and we had to
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.280]  bleep it out for our viewers.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.360]  But they were saying F words and you a-holed and all this stuff to the guys.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.360]  Real loud.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.360]  Yeah, real loud.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.280]  And then the cops come, converge on the two guys who are minding their own business, not
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.600]  the young guy who's yelling and cussing.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.400]  Well, you've seen people that have gone out to these illegal immigration rallies where
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.720]  millions of illegals, some of these are hundreds of thousands, but millions total are marching.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.080]  I've got it in Endgame, the extra.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.840]  And the guy is simply there protesting himself peacefully, and the cops beating blood's coming
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.840]  out his face.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.200]  And the illegals come over and taunt and join in, and the cops are like high-fying them.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.680]  I mean, this is a takeover, folks.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.040]  And again, it's not to empower the illegals either, it's just all a takeover.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.040]  When you look at this, you see what their attitude toward the First Amendment is.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.360]  You see what their tolerance is.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.040]  I mean, they're making demands on everybody, and they don't have any respect for the First
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040]  Amendment even when they have respect for the Second Amendment.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.080]  And what they're doing with this guy in terms of standing in front of him and blocking him
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.640]  front and back is the same thing that Biden and these other guys are doing.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.680]  When we try to get the truth out there about the ammunition purchases and everything, they
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.560]  just hold up more signs in front of us and say, you're crazy.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.840]  It'd be like if you came up to the bank, an old lady came up and saw guys in masks with
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  bags of money.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.040]  And she said, are you robbing the bank?
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.240]  And you're like, he's wearing a mask.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.920]  He goes, no, ma'am, we're not.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.840]  I mean, it's that level, Jakari?
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.320]  Yeah, it shows that they want their voice to be heard, their angle to be heard.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.000]  But if you have a differing opinion, they just completely shut them down.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  You're absolutely right.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  What's the next clip?
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.200]  Well, the next one we got is kind of a thing about, go ahead, Jakari, you talk about it.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.200]  Oh, well, this one, the next clip is about somebody asked Acevedo or he brings up the
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.800]  statement about the gun crime in Chicago.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:34.040]  And he said, I'm tired of people bringing up gun crime in Chicago as a reason why they
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040]  need their guns.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]  So if we have that clip ready, we can go ahead and play it.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040]  This is amazing.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:44.560]  I'm tired of people saying this to the American people, if gun laws are so good and so effective,
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.680]  why is there so much gun violence in Chicago?
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.760]  Why is there so much gun violence in Philadelphia?
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.760]  I will tell you why, because those guns are coming out from other parts of the country
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.080]  where we have a loophole that's bigger than the Grand Canyon, that's where those guns
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.080]  are coming from.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:06.000]  David, with regard to guns, we need to take away the reason that people are shooting one
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  another.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  That's right.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.320]  And that's because Chicago, the superintendent of police says 80% of the killings are from
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.880]  gangs fighting over the control of drugs.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880]  Exactly.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.120]  Doesn't that tell us something?
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:25.320]  So if you want to talk about the control of drugs or you want to talk about guns, you
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.800]  need to take away the reason that the people are using the drugs and why the people are
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.480]  buying and using the guns.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.240]  And that's a former prosecutor you interviewed, but I just want to say this about Acevedo.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.900]  Why don't we have that crime right here?
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.080]  Because loophole guns could come here.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.080]  It's because it's a-
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.080]  Go ahead, Jacari.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.080]  That's the exact point.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.720]  David brought up the point that if, let's say, they are getting their guns from Texas
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:51.560]  or wherever else, then we should have at least the same amount of crime that they have in
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.640]  Chicago.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.600]  Every one of these liberal cities is not liberal.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.380]  These are mafia families.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:00.340]  They bring in the drugs, the whores, the corruption, and then that's all that can, and the criminals
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:03.760]  all move there because less than half the murders get solved there.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.220]  Chicago's the place to go bust in houses and rape women.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.140]  By his argument, we should have a high crime rate because we have free access to guns.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.600]  So it should be higher and higher.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.480]  But the other thing is is that he wants to invoke Chicago.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.200]  We've got a former prosecutor who was there for 43 years as a Cook County prosecutor.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200]  In Chicago.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.200]  In Chicago.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.800]  And he quotes the current Chicago police chief saying that 80% of the shootings in Chicago
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.800]  are because of-
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.960]  And you interviewed him last week, give people his name.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.820]  His name is Jim Gierach, and he's with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.560]  It's former prosecutors and former-
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.160]  And you can just see in his eyes, he's a caring, loving, good person.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.040]  And you look in the eyes of Martinez or Bloomberg, these are evil power tripping villains.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.560]  I mean, you know a bad guy when they're that bad, they don't want to hide it.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.880]  I mean, these are bad people.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.520]  I mean, it's just like, come on.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.160]  When we look at the gun statistics that Piers Morgan puts out there, it needs to be said
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.880]  that the majority, like you said in Chicago, 80% of these gun shootings are because of
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]  drug probiotics.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.040]  And then they say, well, you don't care because it's the gangs.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.320]  No, but gang bangers killing each other over government shipped in drugs don't take my
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320]  guns.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320]  That's right.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320]  That's right.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.600]  But they want to turn it against a legitimate, peaceful gun-
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.780]  Well, we've also got the statistic of the 49% drop in violent crime the last 20 years.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.280]  That's the big secret where the guns are.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.520]  Jakari, tell us what's coming up after the break, the other clips.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.320]  After this break, we'll have a comparison of crowds to the moms to some other events
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:32.060]  and also Acevedo as he criticizes constitutional sheriffs and Acevedo's view on gun registration
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.320]  and much more.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:39.640]  And continuing with guns, we've got the head of the amazing, of the rock stars to me, the
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640]  Veritas project.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.520]  You know, the folks that blew up Acorn politically, they went, they went out-
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]  I'd say politically, yeah.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]  Absolutely.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.440]  Well, they blew them up.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.860]  They absolutely destroyed them.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.920]  Now they've gone to the house of Piers Morgan and guess what?
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]  He's got armed guards.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:01.040]  I mean, these hypocrites make me want to throw up.

[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.920]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps,
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.640]  low moisture and low oxygen.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.880]  If you're storing in a basement too humid, garages and attics too hot, but the waterproof
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:28.500]  double-walled high-density polyethylene patent-pending Eat Pod is a unique roll-away food bunker
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:33.760]  that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet and can keep your survival

[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.960]  The Eat Pod from Long Life Food Depot.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:01.600]  Since 1983, sending real food to your real future.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:07.960]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.520]  a war on for your mind.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.000]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.640]  You know, I wanted to believe in Chief Arte Saaveda and I think he's been in the studio
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.400]  with me three or four times over the years.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.600]  But I was like, if this guy's an operative, he's going to go to the top.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.200]  This guy may be deep cover.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.960]  And I'd said that to a lot of people behind the scenes here and then they all agreed.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.360]  But now, I mean, he's like in the bosom of Obama and he came out of the Justice Department
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.320]  as, you know, as a state police officer, as one of their operatives spying on the police
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320]  there.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.680]  And I'm not against checks and balances federal state.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.840]  It's just that there's no checks now.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.120]  It's the feds only taking over the state.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.640]  Jharkari, David Knight, you guys were at this 15 bureaucrat march, a million mom march,
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.240]  15 bureaucrat march, you know, the wives and husbands of city council people and state
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.120]  bureaucrats and federal bureaucrats.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.120]  Get into the fake signs.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.640]  I've seen this at the U.N. where they have all the fake signs, they hand them out.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.640]  That's the next clip, isn't it?
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640]  Yeah.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.640]  Tell us about that.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.140]  Well, as we got there, my wife was there and she just recorded some of it with her iPhone.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:12.860]  And basically, they had handwritten signs that they were handing out to people.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:16.600]  And we wanted to contrast that with the Day of Resistance, which was a pro-Second Amendment
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.960]  rally that was really a grassroots organization.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.560]  And you know, when they start doing things like this, the first thing that comes to mind
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.560]  is astroturf.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.100]  You know, and quite frankly, this mom's demand to plan is very well financed.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:30.120]  Their website is really top notch.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.980]  I mean, you know, obviously, when you look at the Day of Resistance, it was something
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:33.980]  that was thrown together.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.320]  No, it's a known Bloomberg front.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.320]  So we want to take a look at this.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.800]  We've got a clip of them handing out.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.040]  Let's go to that.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.040]  This was fantastic.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.240]  I have to tell you, we really missed Alex here today.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.120]  It was a great crowd, maybe 2 to 2500 people.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.360]  It was just jam packed with people.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.360]  That's Sheriff Mack.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.360]  Yes, Sheriff Mack.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.200]  Dedicated to the holy cause of liberty, as Patrick Henry called it.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.200]  This is the Day of Resistance.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.240]  And you can see the real signs right there.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.240]  Real people.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.280]  That looks like a thousand or more.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.280]  I wasn't there.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.280]  The Day of Resistance?
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  They showed up with their own signs.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.760]  I mean, they had them in the back of their trucks.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.720]  Here's a grandmother, mother, NRA life member.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.240]  This is the most recent.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.520]  A staggering figure that surpasses other designers.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.520]  And listen here.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.120]  Thank you for making them.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.360]  Thank you for holding them.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.440]  So they're handing out signs.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.200]  And they're all done looking different.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.200]  Yeah.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.200]  I mean, it's just.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:31.080]  It's something, you know, if you go to a Romney rally or a Ron Paul rally, they've got signs
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.600]  that they hand out to people and it's obviously that they're printed up, right?
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600]  People are holding that.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600]  Yeah, they're all uniform.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.600]  Then it's not deceptive.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600]  It's Ron Paul.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  Boom.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.600]  Yeah.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.600]  Right.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600]  But you make up a lot of different.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.600]  But if Ron Paul had a whole bunch of different ones that looked like they were grassroots
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600]  and was fake.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600]  I mean, it'd be a scandal.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.120]  You can see all the signs they have on the table right there.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.640]  For radio listeners, you can watch us right now streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.520]  This will be archived later in the day at prisonplanet.tv and then tomorrow at mfowars.com
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520]  for radio listeners.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.200]  This is powerful info because it shows it's all a fraud.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.200]  Right.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.760]  Well, that's something that bears some more investigation about whether it's Astroturf.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.760]  Exactly.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  Exactly.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.760]  We have more clips to get to.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.600]  Our next clip is asked of Vato as he criticizes constitutional sheriffs, people like Sheriff
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.600]  Mack.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.600]  So the guys are ready with that clip.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.600]  We can get that roll.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.600]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.720]  You can't say that you stand for the Constitution as an elected sheriff law enforcement official
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.560]  as part of the executive branch and vote the Constitution in terms of the Second Amendment
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.120]  and turn around and absolutely ignore the rest of our 200 years of law that talks about
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.120]  the separation of powers.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.120]  You are the executive branch, whether you like it or not.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  Your job is to enforce the law as passed by the legislative branch, as interpreted by
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.120]  the judicial branch, as it's carried out by the executive branch, and to say otherwise
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:35.120]  is hypocrisy.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.120]  God bless you all.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.120]  Thank you for being here.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.120]  You've analyzed the statistics honestly.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:43.120]  I think you'll see that it is better to have a government.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:52.120]  However, those are the things that we need to do in order to make sure that we have a
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.120]  government that's better to have a government.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.120]  However, those are immaterials.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.760]  Those arguments mean nothing when you live in a country where the supreme law of the
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.480]  land completely and entirely forbids gun control in this country.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.800]  All forms of gun control are against the law here.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.320]  In my book, The Magic of Gun Control, there's a chapter that says gun control in America
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320]  is for your own.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.520]  We're going to need local officials, especially sheriffs, to tell the federal government there's
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.880]  just a few things you're not going to do in our county, and one of them is gun control.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]  It's against the law.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.780]  All right, again, a lot of crowd noise there, but I mean, talk about what Acevedo is saying
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:33.780]  there.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.200]  And again, we have a clip after the break, Biden is running around saying the black helicopter
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.360]  people think we're going to send the Secret Service into your states.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.880]  They've got bills introduced that they're trying to ram through where they will send
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:46.880]  them in to go after sheriffs.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.320]  I mean, it's just the same, it's a military tactic.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.240]  We're not trying to take your guns even though we are.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.280]  There are no bullets.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.440]  There is no bill for Secret Service to come into your state.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.660]  I mean, they lie to you because you are seen as an enemy.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:59.240]  This standard military operation.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.600]  Well, it's very interesting to see what Acevedo is doing.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.300]  What he's doing is he's taking a system of checks and balances that wasn't just at the
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.300]  federal level.
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.160]  There were checks and balances where the people have a check and balance.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.180]  They have the Second Amendment, they've got jury nullification, the states have a check
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.960]  and a balance against the federal government.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.460]  And what he's doing is he's taking away that system of checks and balances, and he's trying
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:22.880]  to substitute a rigid hierarchy that is federally based.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.240]  And that's what his speech was about.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.400]  That's why he attacked the constitutional sheriff.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.080]  All right, we've got our next guest coming up, but I want you guys to stay over and finish
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.240]  that last clip and talk about what we're facing here.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.680]  But the big news is, and the video's up at infowars.com, of the Austin City Councilman
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.080]  who's hooked in with Bloomberg saying, we're gonna register, then we're gonna confiscate.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.440]  And the crowd sharing that video is coffin nails politically to these people.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.440]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.400]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.800]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:00.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:04.760]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:10.320]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.540]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.440]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.840]  The fact is you are.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.000]  We all are.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.520]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.300]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:32.060]  the cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.480]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.920]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.300]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.120]  I had tried everything.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.360]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.560]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:12.040]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:17.920]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.920]  be satisfied.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.240]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:30.840]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.780]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:41.120]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.600]  Now that's results.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:48.400]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.400]  their products.

[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:31.400]  The news websites are Infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.320]  I am your host again, Alex Jones, David Knight, and Ja'Kari Jackson are in studio here with
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.320]  me right now.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:45.740]  And they went to the Mayor Bloomberg sponsored and run a trader convention a few days ago.
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:50.760]  And then Arte Sevedo went up to be with Obama and Biden as one of their poster people calling
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.700]  for restrictions of the Second Amendment.
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:57.560]  And Councilman Mike Martinez said to people that had signs saying no gun ban, stop gun
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560]  ban.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.560]  He said, hey, we're not gonna do that now.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.440]  We're getting them registered now.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.500]  But you're gonna need that sign soon cuz we are gonna do what's on your sign.
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.520]  And laughs at him and the crowd cheers.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:10.440]  And then in my report that's up on Infowars.com show Feinstein saying the same thing.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.320]  I mean, it's the disingenuousness of them.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.480]  And I wanna play a clip of Biden here before we go back to the other three short clips.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:26.400]  And then go to the head of the Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, who sent reporters out to the
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.860]  home of Piers Morgan, who has an armed response sign, meaning he has armed guards.
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:34.240]  So he uses guns protecting himself, but you shouldn't be able to.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.320]  The all out assault by these kleptocrats is accelerating right now.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.700]  But here's Biden saying he's used to disinformation campaigns.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:46.520]  You see, Forbes, how the US military would crush a Tea Party rebellion, DHS funded course
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.760]  asked cops if they'll confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.440]  I mean, that's in the Colorado newspapers.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.720]  Fox News, army labeled evangelicals as religious extremists.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.800]  I mean, the army's training to take on Christians.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.800]  I told you this first, I'm the crazy man cuz I actually am freaked out knowing we've got
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.000]  a bunch of authoritarians taking over.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.920]  This is how they don't build a new car or a new computer or write a book to be popular.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:13.480]  They take over and take your tax money, okay?
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.800]  And these are authoritarians, these are not liberals.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.160]  So here's Biden going, he knows about disinformation.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.160]  There's no plan to use Secret Service on sheriffs.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.160]  There's no New World Order.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.160]  He just gave a speech.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:28.840]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bills are being introduced all over the place.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:33.960]  Where the Secret Service operates now is your state police and goes after, quote, law enforcement.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.680]  I mean, this is all, and they're like, it's not happening.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.680]  It's not happening.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:38.960]  Let's go and go to that club.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:46.880]  Now the NRA is engaging in a campaign which is, I'm not unaccustomed to, of disinformation
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.800]  to try to scare people.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.440]  Let me read some of the things they're saying about background checks.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:59.040]  They say, quote, we, the federal government, want to put every private firearms transaction
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.280]  right under the thumb of the federal government and keep all those names in a massive federal
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:05.280]  register.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.680]  They've been caught doing it before.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.600]  Kind of scary, man.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.960]  Black helicopter crowd really is upset.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.020]  Keep it in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:15.360]  But guess what?
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:20.640]  They want to say that universal background checks are, quote, an unworkable universal
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.400]  federal nightmare.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.400]  Of course.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.880]  Bureaucracy that law abiding citizens don't want.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.880]  And guess what?
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.880]  They say the sun comes up.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.920]  They say even if we get a true universal background check, it will never keep criminals from buying
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920]  guns.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.480]  None of this is true.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.040]  Let me say something.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.440]  And I guess there's another clip I saw last night where he was talking about the Secret
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.440]  Service stuff.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  So they're just running around.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  Go ahead.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.240]  It's not the NRA that's saying that necessarily.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.880]  It's the ACLU.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.880]  No friend of the Second Amendment is saying that these background checks and this registry
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.720]  that they're setting up is really wrong.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.720]  Unconstitutional.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.040]  It's the ACLU that's saying that as well as the NRA.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:03.120]  I know, but the thing is, how long, they're not getting away with this.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.160]  I was about to say, how long can they get away with it?
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.440]  Everyone knows that they make Bill Clinton look honest.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:11.720]  I mean, the lying level of this group, it's just a bunch of criminals.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:18.200]  It's like Acorn where the Project Veritas goes in and they go, I want to run underage
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.720]  kids as slaves, sex slaves.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.320]  Oh, we're here to help you.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.240]  He goes to, I mean, it's just, and he goes to group after group and they say that.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.240]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.600]  I mean, it's just full on criminals.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  Yeah, it is.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.600]  We'll help you.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.960]  Just don't tell anybody that we did.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.000]  It's completely ridiculous.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Because they're above the law.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  Yeah.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  Yeah.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  And we'll get to these last couple of clips we have.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.680]  Now, our next clip is number six, it's Acevedo's view on gun registration.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.200]  David Knight asked him the question, how would you feel about registering people who have
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.520]  never committed a criminal offense?
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.240]  So if we have that clip, we can go ahead and roll it.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.760]  Registration of people who have not been convicted of any crime?
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.760]  You know what?
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.040]  Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with that because to me, I register my car for
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.120]  a reason.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.760]  That is so people know that's my vehicle, belongs to me.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.680]  If anybody's found that vehicle and it gets run, then they know there's a problem.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.680]  When I sell my vehicle, I do what's called release of liability, I transfer ownership.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:15.760]  Again, I know that folks really believe that if we had registration of firearms, that that's
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.620]  the step right before confiscation.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.440]  And my response to that is, the day the government wants to do something silly, like go around
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:28.160]  to over 300 million Americans and take guns and 300 sets of homes with different people,
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.040]  they'd go house to house anyway.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.600]  Now, as far as the registration, we've seen the, or should I say the confiscation, we've
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.840]  seen that in Hurricane Katrina, but we also have this article, California's gun repo men
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.480]  have a nerve-wracking job, and I'll just read this short section.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.860]  Many states lack the ability to confiscate firearms because they don't track purchases
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:52.480]  as closely as California, which requires most sales to go through a licensed dealer to be
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.980]  in be reported.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.600]  This is a quote, very, very few states have an archive of firearm owners like we do, says
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.720]  Win Mute, who helped set up the program.
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.480]  So they're saying if we knew who had more-
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.080]  I have seen an insane California has confiscated no guns.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.000]  And then Adan Salazar wrote an article for Infoworks.com, which is them taking the guns
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.920]  and saying we use the database to get them.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.880]  Yeah, I mean, that's what this is right here, this article right here, California gun repo
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.160]  men have a nerve- You know what, this is so important, I wanna
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:24.120]  bring you all back into the next hour to play the first clip where Martina says, don't worry,
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:26.040]  we're gonna register, then we'll get your guns.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.840]  I wanna have you back to finish up on this at the bottom of the next hour, guys, I'm
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.840]  gonna go to our guest.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.840]  Okay.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.240]  Amazing, great job, gentlemen, and we'll have this all together in one big report on the
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.440]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central, that I'm hosting, and one of you guys is doing
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.920]  the interview right here, you're interviewing tonight?
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.400]  I believe we're talking about the Paul Revere interview, so it's my understanding.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.760]  Oh, good, good, that'll be awesome.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]  Yeah.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760]  All right, great job, gentlemen.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.800]  We have the reporters back in here after we take calls for the first 30 minutes of the
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800]  next hour.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:56.000]  I wanna bring up James O'Keefe now of TheProjectVeritas.org, and in a minute we'll play him this clip.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.600]  This clip of the Austin City Council member saying, first we're gonna register, then we're
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.600]  gonna take your guns.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.020]  But when I was talking to them about a month ago, I said, somebody ought to go out to Piers
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:07.440]  Morgan's house and see if he's got any bodyguards.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.560]  And sure enough, he does, and he has Armed Response, which is a company that promises
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:16.560]  within five minutes to have an armored truck pull up with guys with semi-automatic assault
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.980]  rifles and handguns.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:22.600]  And sure enough, he's got that sign that guns protect his home, just amazing hypocrisy.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:27.240]  And of course, none of the media picked it up, Infowars.com covered it, DrugsReport.com
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.440]  covered it, WorldNetDaily covered it, DrugsReport, of course, picked up our story.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.880]  But James, good to have you back with us, my friend.
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.600]  Great to be back with you, Alex.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:41.160]  What do you think of just the all-out hysterical assault on the Second Amendment and the unprecedented
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:45.480]  level of just lying about everything you're seeing and hearing?
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:49.040]  I think as I was on your show last time, we talked about how they would not put a gun
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.560]  on their lawn that says this home is proudly gun-free.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:59.760]  But now we're finding Armed Response security system signs on the property of Piers Morgan.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:02.140]  This is his Beverly Hills property.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:06.840]  And we actually confronted Piers Morgan in the street outside of his CNN headquarters
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:12.480]  and asked him if he would be willing to help sign a pledge to remove guns from movies,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.860]  if any movie led to the death of any young child.
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:22.600]  So what I'm seeing is just the people who want to take guns away are not willing to
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.440]  apply that to their own personal lives.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.600]  Now we're going to roll some of this video for TV viewers out there that you guys shot.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.880]  It's up at your Project Veritas site.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:35.520]  The people want to see the whole thing, which I suggest they do, and share it.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.000]  But for radio listeners, describe what your team did.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.440]  Describe how you got the image of the fact that he has the sign saying he has an Armed
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.000]  Response security system.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.800]  I mean, this is classic, over-the-top hypocrisy.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:56.320]  Yeah, this was in a very, very expensive area of Beverly Hills.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.600]  And we called the Armed Security Response Systems Company.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:05.360]  That's on the sign to determine exactly what it means to be armed.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.520]  And she wouldn't give me too much information, this is the spokesperson, but she did say
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:16.280]  that there is the option to have private armed security show up if the response is triggered,
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.920]  if the alarm is triggered.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.640]  So it is definitely the height of hypocrisy.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:26.880]  It's not a surprise, most of these journalists are very anti-gun in their messaging, but
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.840]  in their personal lives, they turn out to be pretty pro-gun, actually.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.960]  So I think we need to be doing more of just exposing the media's hypocrisy, because it
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.600]  is the media that is doing this.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.680]  Yeah, I need to put you in contact with a group that has surveillance footage of Piers
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.680]  Morgan.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.040]  I have the footage, but I haven't run it past legal, legal's normally myself, but I wanted
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.280]  to have it checked before I did anything.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.840]  Well, we've had it about a month.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.760]  It's Piers Morgan behind the scenes shooting guns, talking about how much he'd love to
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.240]  live in Texas and have guns like this.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:02.080]  And it's high-def surveillance footage of him, and I just haven't released it yet.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.160]  I guess I've now released the fact that we have that footage.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.720]  There's no end to it, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.520]  No, the funny thing, legal, I mean, we deal with legal issues all the time.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.480]  We're very careful not to cross the line.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.560]  We didn't release Piers Morgan's personal address, but we did look up property deeds.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:24.840]  And incidentally, it seems to be he's got a property in Calabrasas, California, Beverly
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.260]  Hills, California.
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:28.640]  He works in New York.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:33.080]  Some of them are registered under different names, but this is in a very ritzy area of
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.080]  Beverly Hills.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.960]  But the paycheck is more important than the principles.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:39.960]  They're not willing to live up to the courage of their own principles.
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.680]  In fact, personally, in their own lives, they're very pro-gun, and then publicly, they're anti-gun.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:48.640]  So they're not only hypocrites, they're frauds.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:54.240]  It's pretty incredible to sit there and see this unfold.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.400]  Do you think they're gonna succeed?
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:59.240]  They say it's Razor's margin in the Senate with this bill they've got, but they've set
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.560]  up this idea that every time there's a new shooting, it's gun owners' fault.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.520]  Like every time someone gets stabbed with an Exacto knife, like at Lone Star College
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.080]  in Texas, 12 people, it's the fault of anyone that owns butcher knives.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:17.120]  I mean, it's just so asinine, but are they gonna succeed with their war against reality?
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.000]  Well, I think that one of the things that helps them is they say that it's for the children.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:29.080]  And there's a lot of sort of propaganda in the news about being for the children.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.680]  They're always talking about children.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.760]  And that's one of the things I think that we frame the debate in a very interesting
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.920]  and different way.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:41.480]  This time around, we actually went up to these people and actually said, well, it's for the
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.480]  children.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.720]  You know, edit out guns from movies.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.060]  We tried to make a point about the absurdity.
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:53.240]  But I think the fact that they frame it as for the children is really what takes it into
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:55.360]  a realm where you really can't disagree with them.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.800]  And I think we need to be saying, you know, what we want to do is for the children.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.920]  We need to be, you know, turning it on its head.
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.160]  But it's definitely out of control.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.600]  Our story is up at drugsreport.com right now for anybody that would like to go there under
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:15.340]  the image of the former Congressman Weiner.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:20.100]  Police confiscating firearms from people taking anti-anxiety medication.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:24.560]  Now they're saying, and then the State House is talking about this, and of course, that's
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.840]  the model of the country, New York, for gun confiscation is they brag that they are going
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:35.620]  to go after everybody's guns who's ever been on any anti-anxiety.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:39.960]  If you've ever had a prescription for Valium 30 years ago, they're now digitizing those
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:40.960]  records.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.840]  Like, hey, you know, you're stressed out, quit drinking, take some Valium.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.000]  You know, a doctor recommends that.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.860]  Or here, you know, you had a car wreck or your wife died here, you know, go on Luvox
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:51.800]  and then you don't like it, you get off.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.920]  And then they're going to say everybody is mentally ill and take their guns.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.080]  Are you concerned this could cause a civil war?
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:02.040]  Because I'm here to tell you, Homeland Security is training for a civil war.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:06.880]  They're preparing for a civil war, while Biden is saying that they're not.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.880]  But they are.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.120]  I mean, what do you, I mean, do they have dreams of grandeur that they could be like
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.960]  Hitler or Stalin?
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:14.960]  You're asking me?
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.960]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:21.480]  I don't, I don't know what exactly they're preparing for, but I think the priority for
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:28.240]  us right now, the priority for citizen journalists is to take it directly to the media.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:31.560]  Take it directly to Piers Morgan's front lawn.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:35.400]  Take it directly outside of his office in Time Warner in New York.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:39.140]  Take the fight right to these journalists because they control the message.
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.360]  Because they're not journalists, they're not journalists.
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.400]  They were assaulting one or two pro-gun guys in Austin and then on the news said they caused
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.420]  a problem at the anti-gun rally.
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:51.600]  And then they said, we're going to register.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.600]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:53.600]  It's just, they're so deceptive.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.920]  I mean, they're the bad guys, is my point.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.560]  That's what people don't seem to understand.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:03.160]  I mean, yes, there's a lot of government fraud and lying going on, but I think the priority
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.240]  is to take it directly to the journalists.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.560]  Take it to their doorsteps, take it to their companies.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.800]  Point out the hypocrisy in their personal lives and that will ultimately discredit them.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:19.360]  And it will have a huge impact on any legislative battle because the media owns the message.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:24.880]  So I think that the priority of Project Veritas is to highlight the hypocrisy of the journalists
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.880]  themselves.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.980]  There needs to be more people doing that.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:32.440]  People don't, I don't think they underestimate the power of our media, the power of the hypocrites
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.080]  at CNN and these other places.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.440]  Well, I mean, CNN and all the media numbers that come out every month show this, all of
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.000]  the dominant media is no longer dominant.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.720]  They're a shadow of their former self.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.740]  I mean, Larry King 15 years ago had 10 million viewers some nights.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:52.280]  When he left, it was a million and a half and now Piers Morgan's lucky if he gets a
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.720]  half mil.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.800]  And I guess we just don't put on airs.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.760]  Your videos are seen millions of times.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.080]  My films have been seen hundreds of millions of times just on YouTube alone.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.600]  I reach a million people an hour.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.040]  That by the way is a very conservative number because I want to be conservative.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.920]  Three million a day, 15 million a week one way or another.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:16.920]  I mean, maybe I should dress in royal robes and wear a crown like these people basically
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.960]  do because they are the mouse that roared.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.680]  Well, they still have a lot of power, ABC, NBC, CBS News.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:29.560]  They still carry an ampliphone and a megaphone and I think that a lot of people, they do
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:30.640]  watch our videos.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:36.500]  They do get the message, but a lot of other people are just sort of still watching network
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:37.500]  news.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.560]  Sure, but what I'm saying is, yes, you're right.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:44.260]  They still have power if they all gang up and say the same thing in the same order,
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.360]  but even that's not working.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.100]  I mean, you've seen the White House publicly admitting that, quote, Drudge is, quote, causing
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.120]  them to not even be able to talk to anybody.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.320]  I mean, one website has got them literally crapping their pants.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  That's right.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  And I think there's a lot of people are afraid.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.400]  There's a lot of citizen journalists.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.840]  Drudge was a pioneer, but a lot of them are afraid and I think we got to get just stick
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.960]  together and break stories that force that they got to force the media to talk.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.860]  And the way that I found with our stories to force the media to talk about what we're
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:19.940]  doing and force them to cover it is to talk about the media, is to expose the media and
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:24.600]  expose the fraud like we did at NPR, like we did with the Catch a Journalist series,
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.560]  like we did with the recent signs on the lawns of journalists like Piers Morgan.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:32.580]  Go after, investigate the journalists and you will, I think you'll break through that
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:35.400]  media firewall and actually get onto some of these mainstream.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.020]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:40.160]  That's what they're afraid of is you exposing the man behind the curtain.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.840]  And that's what the White House in memos and in public statements, some of them came out
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.840]  last week.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:51.000]  We saw that where the main chief advisor to Obama said, we can't control the narrative.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.320]  And then he used Drudge as kind of a catch all as the top of the pyramid.
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.200]  I mean, it shows they're not all powerful.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.520]  They're not all powerful.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.520]  There are cracks.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:03.320]  There are cracks in their messaging system.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.920]  But what you have to do is you have to force a consequence.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:12.720]  You have to, and some of your reporting has, reporting has got to force a government reaction
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:16.520]  and that government reaction we picked up in the wires as what we do at Project Veritas.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.720]  We did voter fraud investigations all last year.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.720]  It forced investigation.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.720]  And they tried to put you in prison.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.720]  They tried it.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.600]  They issued criminal grand jury subpoenas against me for exposing the fact that the
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.880]  attorney general's ballot was offered to a complete stranger.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:34.720]  They tried to issue criminal grand jury subpoenas when I exposed, exposed dead people where
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.700]  ballots were given out in the names of dead people in places like New Hampshire.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:42.840]  But what happened, which is interesting, is that the states is that a couple of states
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:48.160]  changed their laws and that forced the media to report on the fact that the laws are being
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.160]  changed.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.160]  That's right.
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.040]  So they dragged their heels because they don't want to talk about these.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.520]  They don't want to talk about the facts.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:55.800]  They want to deny it while they get their takeover done.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.800]  Stay there.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.520]  Let's come back and talk more about how to get on the offensive with Mr. O'Keefe of the
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.520]  Hello.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:05.640]  This is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.560]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.360]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.720]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:23.260]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:28.320]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.480]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.600]  normal cell.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.360]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:42.360]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:46.680]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:50.280]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:57.660]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:58.660]  Protect your immune system.
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.440]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.560]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.720]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.720]  alone.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.280]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:18.120]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:19.520]  The fact is you are.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:20.680]  We all are.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.200]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:27.960]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:31.640]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:36.480]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.840]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:42.800]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best durable foods out there from eFoods
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.800]  Direct.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:49.520]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex and
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.040]  check out their spring specials.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:57.600]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.640]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:02.880]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:06.820]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.760]  and as metal particles into your body?
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.680]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:16.960]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:21.200]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:25.480]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione, the number
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:31.040]  one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your body to produce glutathione
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.320]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:39.960]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured,
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.280]  the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.680]  originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:49.080]  It is one world whey.
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:57.640]  Call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325, or visit OneWorld whey.com, that's OneWorld
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:23.320]  whey.com.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:29.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have to control myself to not literally become crazed on air.
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:32.720]  And it's because I'm the type of guy who's real laid-back fishing, laid-back with my
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:38.020]  wife and my kids, real calm my whole life until somebody starts something with me.
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:39.960]  And then I turn into an absolute maniac.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:42.160]  I mean, it's just my instincts.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:45.640]  You come over and punch me in the nose, you may kick my butt, but you better get ready
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:50.520]  to be attacked 110%, you know, blackout time.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:53.800]  And that's why I start hyperventilating and yelling and screaming because these people
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:59.400]  are a bunch of line crooks, butchering everything, and I'm sick of them.
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:00.400]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:03.960]  And I'm tired of all their memos saying they're gonna ban our guns once they register them.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:04.960]  They've done it all over the world.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:06.840]  They've done it in New York, Chicago.
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:11.280]  And I send my crew out to the anti-gun Bloomberg thing here in Austin.
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.240]  And they've got the mayor pro-team up there that flies around with the globalist, with
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:22.120]  the police chief, who was with Obama and Biden yesterday, saying, as they had people slap
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:29.280]  and hit and grab, we showed the video earlier, the reporters, the citizen activists that
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.600]  are out there with a sign saying, no gun ban.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:36.480]  And then the news says the pro-gun people caused a disturbance.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.480]  They lie about that.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.360]  And then they say no one wants your guns in the newscast and actually show Martinez who
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.360]  said, hey, your sign?
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:47.160]  We're not taking your guns now, but after we finish this work, we are.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.600]  And then we're going to get your guns.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:52.720]  So you're gonna need that sign.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:53.720]  Here's the clip.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.040]  I wanna get James O'Keefe's comment on this and talk about what's coming up next with
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  theprojectveritas.org.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.040]  Here it is.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:16.800]  Austin city council member, Mike Martinez.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.080]  First of all, to the gentleman who's dying for attention, someone needs to inform them
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:28.080]  that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work that we're doing here today, we
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.880]  will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.680]  And he's somebody that's called for taking the guns.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.640]  So that's from a larger report I did, James, what do you say to that where they'll admit
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:42.880]  they want to get the guns, but then they lie on the news and say, oh, we don't want your
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.880]  guns.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:44.880]  We come in peace.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.760]  I would, I would, I would go to that guy.
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:51.880]  I mean, you know, Saul Linsky would say a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag,
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.800]  but when it comes to that guy, I I'd love to go to his house and offer one of our, this
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.400]  home is proudly gun free science and CB and see if he'd be willing to live up to his own
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.560]  book of rules.
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.240]  I doubt he'd be willing to do that.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:10.320]  No, I know a little bit about the Martinez family from folks I know reportedly they packed
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.720]  the heat, but I guess, I guess he just wants our guns.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.440]  He wants the only guy with a gun.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.600]  He probably wants to, you know, a lot of these people, they it's, it's guns for me, but not
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  for these.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:29.360]  It's really about aristocracy and it's, it's about it's about the elites versus the people
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:30.880]  and exactly.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.500]  So we need to expose that we need to, our reporters need to expose the aristocracy,
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:40.920]  the elitism and the disconnect between the people in power and the people who aren't.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.240]  I know you're always doing big stuff.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:43.240]  What's coming next?
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:46.440]  We've got about five major investigations.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.160]  We've got something on Bloomberg.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.400]  We were working on some federal programs.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.960]  Some other stuff I can't even talk about.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.240]  I mean, I'm going to be releasing a book in June.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.120]  It's called Breakthrough.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:04.660]  It is an adventure story that about all the things we've done, all the various government
[01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:08.700]  in organizations we've infiltrated and the reaction and how to survive.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:09.700]  It's a hopeful story.
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:10.700]  How to survive.
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:11.700]  What a great book.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:16.960]  It's a blueprint on how to become real citizen journalists like you've done.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.960]  It's a hand guide.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:22.800]  It's a field manual and how to break through the media firewall.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:27.740]  It's really important not just to just to break stories that actually get covered by
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:28.740]  the name.
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:32.080]  So Saul Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer, how to use deception and evil.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:33.200]  They use that.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.200]  You're writing a handbook, how to use good dedicated to God.
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:59.920]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with our guest.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:17.680]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:34.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.360]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.480]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:37.920]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:41.520]  You know, I know that James O'Keefe knows Glenn Beck, but on the show a lot, and I think
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:43.580]  Glenn Beck does a lot of good work.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:47.600]  My wife calls me this morning, I'm driving into work about 9 a.m. and she goes, Hey,
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:51.360]  I just tuned in to Glenn Beck on local radio on your local affiliate.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:55.560]  And he's talking about how they're going to take everybody's guns who's ever been on any
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:58.640]  type of anti-anxiety medication.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:02.280]  I said, yeah, that's our story from last night.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:05.960]  So I pulled over and I already knew.
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.840]  And I went to Drudge and there was our article, it's on Drudge right now, middle column.
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.320]  And I tune in and he's reading it still, this is like three minutes later, going back to
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.080]  pieces not saying it's from mfallwars.com.
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:24.600]  And here's the deal, and I'm not saying it came from drudgereport.com.
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:29.480]  My issue, maybe I missed it, but it's any time I tune in.
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:33.480]  We don't copy him, he copies us, which I don't mind if he didn't attack us.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:38.640]  See, I've got James O'Keefe on here, because I just want a future for my kids.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.080]  I think the guy's a hero, I think he's a model for all of us, like we are changes.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:48.000]  And I've done this trailblazing work, copy us and do it better.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.360]  This is how we're gonna beat him, that's why when his book comes out, I'm gonna buy thousands
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:53.480]  of them and sell them on mfallwars.com.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:56.840]  I'm ranting here, I don't mean to go off into a Glenn Beck thing, it's just that we need
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:59.280]  more people to fight this tyranny.
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.120]  Because these are real authoritarians, knowing them as good as you do, knowing how criminal
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.520]  they are, do you think I'm wrong in saying this is really a dangerous group of people?
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.320]  No, no, Alex, I've lived it.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:17.440]  There are a number of us who've lived through it, but I've been detained, I've been sued,
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:22.480]  I've been slandered, I've gotten defamation settlements from journalists, I've been through
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:25.500]  just about everything you can go through in your 20s.
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:33.880]  And what I've learned is that the most important thing is to keep going, is to not stop.
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:40.060]  I'm a Christian guy, so I'm not worried, I'm just trying to expose things.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:46.120]  What we don't have enough of is we don't have fact finders, and that's what Drudge is great,
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:50.240]  he links to news stories, new information, you put out one fact, it seems like it gets
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:52.440]  consumed by so many different blogs.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:59.560]  So my message is to get citizen journalists to go out there and not be afraid, and expose
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.080]  new information, new content.
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.680]  We need more content.
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:08.880]  We have plenty of distribution platforms, now we just need new content, and that's what
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.260]  my book is gonna be about.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:14.920]  It's gonna be about how to survive the machine, and make a difference.
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.120]  All the things you've learned, all the knowledge, transferring it to others, invaluable.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.920]  I'm telling you, I'm excited to read the book, that's why, I mean, foaming at the mouth-
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.200]  It's actually, it's not like the Saul Linsky's Rules for Radicals, you said he dedicated
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.200]  it to Lucifer.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.800]  In many ways, I kind of half-heartedly dedicate this book to Saul Linsky, because I learned
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.200]  a lot from people like Saul Linsky and these community organizers.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:48.400]  They used to organize people for power to overturn the republic, the democratic idea.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.600]  And what I'm doing is using those same community organizing tactics to organize like-minded
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:54.920]  citizen journalists for power.
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:57.720]  And you're using the truth instead of lies, well, see, I haven't read your book yet, you're
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:58.720]  gonna send me a copy.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:02.340]  I mean, I guess there's not even copies out there yet, but you notice I peered into what
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:05.200]  was happening, cuz I get what you're saying.
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:10.040]  Maybe if you still have time to change the foreword, make the joke about dedicated to
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:15.320]  Saul Linsky, but no, not really, he dedicated it to Lucifer, he used lies.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.920]  We're using truth, I dedicate this to Jesus Christ.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.760]  That's a very good idea, I'm actually finishing the acknowledgements right now, so I can add
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:24.760]  something to that.
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:28.640]  Well, I don't mean to be a preacher, but there's your word of knowledge, my friend.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.640]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:33.000]  Well, Lord Vader.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.360]  Hey seriously, let's do five more minutes, or do you have to go, you got another interview
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  coming up?
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.960]  Actually, I just have to, I got a couple of my guerrilla journalists in the field right
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:46.600]  now doing some videos, so I have to advise them, so I'm calling at two o'clock.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:49.880]  Absolutely, all right, we'll get to that, and then we're gonna have you back very soon
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:52.560]  to talk more about what's going on, cuz I know you're gonna be breaking big news on-
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.040]  We're gonna be breaking stories all the next few months, so I'll be sure to-
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:02.880]  I'm sorry, Bloomberg, we'll be right back, thanks buddy.
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:09.200]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.200]  Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:15.140]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:19.900]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:22.400]  that are earth-friendly and safe.

[02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:35.000]  Buy the one to two month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.800]  you're using now, or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps for all your cleaning
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:41.800]  needs.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.600]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:48.800]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:06:00.960]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com, or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:05.680]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:10.440]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:14.160]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.840]  Check out Simply Safe.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:20.320]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:23.240]  Go to GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:25.760]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid.
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:30.160]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you are protected.
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:34.960]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer,
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.900]  storage unit, or shed.
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:39.320]  GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:44.120]  Simply Safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes, so there's no
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.500]  need to let a stranger into your home.
[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:50.600]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:54.560]  You aren't always at home, but Simply Safe will stand guard, protecting your property
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:57.440]  24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:00.600]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.680]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.920]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.920]  alone.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:14.420]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:18.320]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:19.720]  The fact is, you are.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.880]  We all are.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:23.400]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:28.200]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:31.960]  the cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:36.820]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:39.200]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:42.840]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:43.840]  e Foods Direct.
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:49.940]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex and
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:51.480]  check out their spring specials.
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:58.080]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:01.600]  You can bet your life on e Foods Direct.
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:24.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:31.860]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m., we're here live and I am waging war
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:32.860]  on the globalists.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:38.800]  They work for foreign banks that openly announce they're establishing an authoritarian, tyrannical
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.080]  world government.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.960]  Financial Times of London, their editor years ago, four years ago, wrote, and now for world
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:49.120]  government and said, you bet we're secretive, you bet we're authoritarian, and we're smarter
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:51.100]  than you and we're going to run your life.
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.720]  And you know what the whole plan is?
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:58.480]  Running in world government, cut off the resources so they can socially engineer you and your
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:00.680]  family, get rid of the family.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:05.960]  You'll all live in these government dormitories with, basically, it's a bunch of nobodies
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:13.180]  who can't win in a normal society, being good looking, smart, hard working, funny, inventive.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:18.200]  They form games, cuz it doesn't matter if a bunch of mangy hyenas are nothing compared
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:19.760]  to a big lion.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:22.480]  You get about 20 of them, they can kill any lion they want.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.280]  And that's what this is.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:29.280]  That's what this whole thing is throughout history, is you've got people in gangs and
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:34.160]  people that gravitate towards gangs, government gangs, police gangs, corporate gangs, bureaucratic
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:35.160]  gangs.
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:38.660]  And you've got a bunch of foreign offshore banks.
[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:39.760]  People say, how do you fight them?
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.520]  Go look at who gives money to Handgun Control Incorporated, the Violence Policy Center,
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:48.280]  and then all the other big foundations that fence it out to them, the Ford Foundation,
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.980]  the Carnegie Foundation.
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:54.000]  Go look at what they're for in the family, get rid of national sovereignty, open the
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.200]  borders completely up to bring in groups that are clients of the government.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:01.000]  I wouldn't be against 50 million people from Mexico if they were loving George Washington's
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.720]  Second Amendment private property, because it's the content of the minds.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:10.240]  I don't care every Californian moves to Texas, except they flee what they've done there.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.480]  Cuz I'd say California's prettier than Texas on average.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.560]  I'd love it if it was like Texas, I'd probably live there, but it's a hell hole.
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:19.520]  And then you come here, you've already pooped in your pool there.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:23.920]  Now I'm in the pool in Texas and you're squatting, crapping all over us, and I'm like, listen,
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:24.920]  you're crapping in the pool.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.280]  And they're like, no, I'm not, while I'm watching them do it.
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.840]  Listen, get it through your bug-eyed brain, okay?
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:32.920]  You're not gonna suck us dry like Russia and Nazi Germany.
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.240]  Get it through your stinking brain.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:39.280]  I know you're cowards and weak, so you lust after power cuz you've never had it, okay?
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:42.560]  You don't even know what you're getting into, okay?
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.260]  Because you're weak idiots.
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:48.040]  The useful idiots always open up the bridge, the drawbridge, and open the gate for the
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.540]  enemy to come in.
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:53.280]  And you know the first people the enemy slits the throats of is, they don't want a traitor
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:55.120]  that'll open the gate for the next person.
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:00.560]  They despise you, Mike Martinez, they despise you.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.800]  And the globalists all hate each other as well.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:08.440]  I mean, they've written about it at these Bilderberg and Davos and Bohemian Grove meetings.
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.320]  They're all a bunch of backstabbing mafia crud, dishonorable.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.080]  That's why they wanna corrupt society, so you're dishonorable.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:23.160]  Because if you're not dishonorable, then society will be strong and they can't overrun you.
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:29.120]  And I'm not an honorable person because I've got some goody-two-shoes idea.
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.200]  I'm honorable because it makes sense.
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  And let me tell you, this is a dishonorable world now.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.200]  Wickedness is spreading.
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.160]  And I don't mean the wickedness the preacher talks about and he's a goody-two-shoes and
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.480]  a fake, okay?
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:44.760]  I know about wickedness because my heart is wicked, very wicked, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:46.480]  But the good in me is even stronger.
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.200]  And I can tell you, not just their political actions, but all of it.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.160]  I've been around the so-called Democratic Party and who they are, they are the authoritarian
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.160]  scum of the earth.
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:56.720]  Does that mean the Republicans are good?
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.420]  No, they're controlled by the very same globalist.
[02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:05.760]  What I'm getting at here is that we are in a crisis and these are bad people.
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.680]  How do you know if you're walking down an alleyway at night and you see some really
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:14.100]  scary people looking at you in an aggressive way and in a predatory way and you know they're
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:17.440]  stalking you and they sure enough say, what time is it, buddy?
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:20.760]  And then if you're dumb enough, cuz they're looking for somebody that'll go up against
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:21.760]  the wall, I'm your friend.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:25.920]  Mind if I have your wallet, cuz that's not even stealing, he gave it to me.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:30.880]  I mean, I've been on the New York subway in the morning and at night when they're doing
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:34.920]  that to an old lady.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:38.560]  And it doesn't even matter.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.560]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.400]  The point is, is that I don't wanna live under this bondage.
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:44.080]  You don't wanna live under it.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:46.120]  Find your common sense.
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:47.120]  Find out what's happening.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:50.440]  I'm gonna have them with us for the rest of the hour here today.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:56.020]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight, we just had James O'Keefe on from the Veritas project.
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:57.020]  And we're taking action.
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:59.900]  And let me tell you, it's exciting, it's bold.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.880]  People play video games for adventure.
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:04.080]  They go and jump out of airplanes for adventure.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.120]  They go and do all this stuff looking for the adventure.
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:11.780]  The adventure is always about defending liberty and freedom so you can go out and write the
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.080]  books you wanna write.
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:15.480]  So you can go out and be the journalist you wanna be.
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:18.680]  So you can go out and worship the God you wanna worship.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:23.360]  So you can go out and build the business and the idea you want without some big cartel
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:27.200]  having government shut you down because you didn't go through the right process.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:29.420]  You know what you gotta do to get drugs approved nowadays?
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:34.200]  You gotta go pay off US military generals to get them to fast track human testing on
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:36.280]  US troops for anything.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:39.140]  I don't know people in drug development, okay?
[02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:42.240]  You go pay off generals and it's all legal.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:46.140]  You pay them off and their advisory board that's got congressmen on it.
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:49.720]  And then they all get a piece of the drug and then it gets approved even if it kills
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:50.720]  people.
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:51.720]  That's how America works.
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:53.960]  You hear, we can't get the drugs approved.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.560]  They've got warehouses of treatments and near cures for everything.
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:04.920]  They have found the cures for cancer 99% of the time, there's no 100%.
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:05.920]  There's complications.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:08.440]  They've got all of it and they're going, we've got all this.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.160]  We've got all this incredible technology.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.980]  We've got any matter power systems.
[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:12.980]  That's been leaked.
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:13.980]  They've got everything.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:16.560]  And they're going, well, we don't need all these people.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:21.320]  Look at their ugly eating hamburgers and stumbling around tattoos all over them.
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.220]  You're the ones that did that to them.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:26.200]  You're the ones that sold them a culture, not saying you're bad if you have tattoos,
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:32.300]  you know my point, to destroy you so that you would be weak so that they could run over
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:33.300]  you.
[02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:38.000]  Eugenics isn't get rid of the bad, build up the good, which is evil in itself because
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.460]  you know where that goes.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:45.040]  Real eugenics, when you get deep into it, is about targeting the strong, the beautiful,
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.460]  the creative because you are a threat to them.
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:51.360]  Just like a lion will kill a baby male lion will come over and smell it and then he'll
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:52.360]  eat it.
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:53.920]  Grizzly bears do it.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:57.780]  Every predatory species does it and make no mistake, humans are predatory.
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.320]  And so the globalists call themselves another species.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.160]  They're above us and they want us disarmed.
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:11.760]  The toll free number to join us after we go through these clips is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.260]  You either wake up and get the fire of liberty burning in your heart or get ready to be a
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:17.120]  total techno slave.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:19.800]  And again, the end of this road isn't just slavery.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:22.720]  The New World Order's got all these little jobs where you can have petty power through
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:23.720]  the system.
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.720]  But at the end of the day, it's meant to be cycled down and shut down.
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:32.080]  800-259-9231, what do you think of Mike Martinez?
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.140]  What do you think of Bloomberg?
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:40.240]  What do you think of these Democrats openly saying with Republican traitors that they
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:43.240]  are going to ban our guns once they register them?
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:44.740]  Well, we already knew that.
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:48.280]  It's the sneakiness of these people that should discredit them.
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:53.560]  But they always have these weak, pathetic, gibbering people that look like mental patients.
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:58.600]  I mean, I've gone to these anti-gun rallies and it just looks like in a matter of they're
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:02.320]  black, white, Hispanic, these people all look like Buzz Bissinger.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:08.160]  I mean, they are fundamentally weirdo people who hate you and wanna pull you down.
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.160]  I'm sorry I've said that.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.680]  Gentlemen, I'm ranting, we're going to break here in a few minutes.
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:16.280]  Sha'Carri, David Knight, hearing all this, I just realized the full assault is now happening.
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.000]  The enemy is putting their full weight on us.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  This is the main assault.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.640]  This is gonna get worse.
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.980]  And this is where we decide who we are.
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:25.360]  And now I realize the gun owners aren't gonna turn them in.
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:26.780]  It's gonna turn into a shooting war.
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:29.400]  They're gonna call gun owners terrorist and it's off to the racist.
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:30.400]  How do we stop that?
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:33.720]  How do we avert that and recap some of the other clips before we play the clips we haven't
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:34.720]  gotten to yet?
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:37.440]  Because you were in here with us last hour for those that don't know.
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:40.000]  Well, you talked about the big- Well, go ahead.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  You talked about the big picture.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.300]  We're gonna talk about some of the details because Arcevedo was talking about registration
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:47.300]  versus confiscation.
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:49.040]  He's talking about, are we really on a slippery slope?
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.320]  And so we wanna talk about some of those issues and what he said there and what he's calling
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:57.600]  for and what the Democrats are calling for, where that's going to lead immediately.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.600]  Absolutely.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.720]  Yeah, and I don't know if the guy's had the clip ready.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:04.120]  It's clip number six if we have time to play that.
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:08.720]  Now, let's go ahead and he's queuing that up and we're gonna- What did you think when
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.960]  the news, cuz I played that local KVUE piece where they said, no one wanted to take the
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:14.960]  guns.
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:18.540]  And then they edit Martinez to make it sound like he wasn't gonna take the guns.
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:22.240]  When he said we're gonna- I mean, it's just- And I guarantee they got a pat on the back.
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.480]  Good job lying to the viewers.
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.000]  Yeah, it's definitely sleight of hand because they took the clip, I can't say they took
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  it out of context.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.240]  They just edited it in a certain way that when they play the lady saying, well, I'm
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:35.360]  not trying to take anybody's guns and maybe she isn't.
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:38.280]  She wants responsible gun restrictions, whatever that means to her.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:41.560]  But then you play Martinez who says, yes, I will take your guns, I'm gonna make your
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.560]  sign legitimate.
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.440]  Cuz you see the guy with the sign that says, in the gun ban or no gun ban.
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:49.080]  I'll guarantee if she's the head of that group, she wants total abolition.
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:50.720]  I've run into these people behind the scenes.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:55.060]  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised at that myself cuz they may start with that.
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:58.220]  We think we can get this today, but I wouldn't be surprised if many of those people just
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:00.480]  wanted to complete abolition of firearms.
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:05.240]  Most of those people have been let out of mental institutions or they're in government.
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:08.160]  I've been to dozens of those.
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:10.200]  And I mean, they're all weirdos, go ahead.
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:12.240]  We need to stop this at registration.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:13.600]  And we're gonna talk about why we need to do that.
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:14.600]  We got that clip ready.
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:15.600]  Let's run that.
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:16.600]  Yeah, let's go to that clip.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:17.600]  Here it is.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:19.840]  Registration of people who have not been convicted of any crime.
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:24.200]  Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with that because to me, I register my car for
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:25.200]  a reason.
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:26.200]  This is Austin Police Chief.
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:27.920]  That is so people know that's my vehicle, belongs to me.
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.860]  If anybody's found that vehicle and it gets run, then they know there's a problem.
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:35.360]  When I sell my vehicle, I do what's called release of liability.
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:36.360]  I transfer ownership.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:39.360]  They use registration now to steal your car, the government does, when you haven't paid
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:40.360]  the taxes.
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:42.880]  I know that folks really believe that if we had registration of firearms, that that's
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.760]  the step right before confiscation.
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.560]  And my response to that is, the day the government wants to do something silly, like go around
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:55.320]  to over 300 million Americans and take guns and 300 sets of homes with different people,
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:57.960]  they'd go house to house anyway.
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:02.640]  So I'm not exactly sure what he was implying- No, no, the official new army manuals for
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:05.620]  house to house gun confiscation, they did it in Katrina.
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:08.780]  And they're already taking guns in all these states that are banning them and arresting
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:11.160]  people for over 10 round mags with felonies.
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:12.480]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.080]  But they do want to know who has the guns.
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:16.420]  Of course they do.
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:17.820]  They admit that, yeah.
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:20.880]  But the thing, listen to the analogy that he's making, because this was all over a lot
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:24.440]  of people's signs that of course had been prepared for the crowd before they got there.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:30.640]  And that was this analogy of automobiles to guns, and registration of automobiles to registration
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:31.720]  of guns.
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:33.240]  That's not the analogy we're talking about.
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:35.840]  We're talking about a First Amendment type of analogy.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:38.560]  You need to compare the Second Amendment to the First Amendment.
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:40.480]  The First Amendment says you'll make no law.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:42.560]  The Second Amendment says you shall not infringe.
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:44.900]  And the only difference between those two is they understood they were going to come
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.400]  after the Second Amendment gradually, incrementally, around their edges, okay?
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:52.860]  And that's exactly what this registration stuff is, is an infringement.
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:56.200]  And then they say at the rally, we're going to ban your guns after we register them.
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:01.160]  And the news spins it and says, relax, relax, this isn't an assault, lay down.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:05.240]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:10.800]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:14.960]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:18.820]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:20.240]  The fact is you are.
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:21.240]  We all are.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:23.880]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:28.640]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:32.360]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:05.680]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:07.920]  afford to pay your electric bill.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:09.680]  That's closer than you think.
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:13.120]  You probably hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:19.660]  is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012, Obama's secret war on coal that could
[02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:24.560]  increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:28.940]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:30.900]  out across America.
[02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:32.360]  But here's some good news.
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:38.080]  There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:41.760]  to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:46.960]  The video at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:51.040]  doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:55.320]  So watch it now at Exposed123.com before it's too late.
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:57.320]  Again, that's Exposed123.com.

[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:30.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:34.440]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:35.440]  IRAs?
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:39.500]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:41.200]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.680]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:49.680]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:55.360]  To get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:59.480]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:01.420]  Chicago is a virtual battlefield.
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:05.600]  More than 500 shooting deaths in 2012 have made Chicago the murder capital of America.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:09.680]  Proof that gun control doesn't work, disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only criminals
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:10.680]  have guns.
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:13.680]  And Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Machine want to keep it that way.
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.560]  If we can't stop them in Chicago, we may lose the whole battle.
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:17.560]  But there's hope.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:21.580]  On April 9th, we have a chance to send billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Rahm Emanuel, and his Chicago
[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:26.120]  Machine a crystal clear message that we have a natural right to defend ourselves, our homes,
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:29.160]  and our families, and that they need to keep their hands off our guns.
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:33.080]  Illinois Republican Paul McKinley is sending that message in a bitterly fought special
[02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:36.220]  election to replace disgraced ex-rep Jesse Jackson Jr.
[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:40.200]  Every vote, every voice in support of Paul McKinley is a stand against the gun-grabbing
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:41.440]  Chicago Machine.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.400]  Will you stand up and defend your gun rights?
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:55.040]  Call 800-979-1555, 800-979-1555, that's 800-979-1555, 800-979-1555, paid for by Tea Party Leadership
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:58.040]  Fund, not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee, the teapartyleadershipfund.com.
[02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:16.280]  All right, the next segment with my two co-hosts here today, Jacari Jackson and David Knight,
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.760]  we will start going to your phone calls interspersed with some of the clips we played earlier.
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:24.880]  But we were just getting into Arte Sveta saying, hey, don't worry about registration leading
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:26.260]  the conversation.
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:27.260]  That's ridiculous.
[02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:31.720]  If you've ever heard of that, meanwhile, they just had a speech up there where the city
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:35.120]  councilman's like, hey, don't worry, first we're gonna register.
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:38.880]  Then you're signed about gun ban, you're gonna need that sign cuz that's what we're gonna
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:39.880]  do.
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:43.580]  And then the crowd's all laughing and cheering and a woman comes up with her hand and kinda
[02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:46.760]  hits him in the back and they're grabbing at a sign and then the media's like, look
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:49.420]  at that troublemaking gun owner over there.
[02:24:49.420 --> 02:24:53.320]  And we don't want your guns, it's like, folks, this is military operations.
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:59.440]  They found in World War I, if you had speakers blaring, this is not an assault.
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:02.640]  Even though troops were coming over, the French and Germans did it back and forth on each
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:05.340]  other that people wouldn't fight as hard.
[02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:10.500]  So they just, it's like in Saving Private Ryan where the German soldiers, they're trying
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:12.200]  to stab each other.
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:16.080]  And the American soldier starts getting the upper hand, and the guy's like, no, let's
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:17.080]  be friends.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:18.080]  Let's be friends.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.080]  We're not fighting now.
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.360]  And the guy gives up and then he's like, slides that knife in.
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:22.680]  We don't want your guns.
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:23.680]  There's no bullets.
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.680]  There's nothing going on.
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.480]  There's no, the fellow reserve it in private.
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:28.480]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:29.480]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:35.320]  Now, I just wanna talk about a little bit about their views, these people at this rally.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:39.680]  They just want reasonable restrictions and one of those restrictions is to have people
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:44.680]  who have felony offenses not be able to have their right to bear arms.
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.060]  Now, to many people it may sound reasonable, they think about felonies as murder or heavy
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:50.300]  drug trafficking.
[02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:54.860]  So we have the article on infowars.com about a man who was arrested, charged with felony
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:57.080]  offenses for releasing balloons.
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:01.620]  And you think about this, this is the new bar, or should I say the bar has been lowered.
[02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:03.940]  You can see the, yeah, you can see it right there.
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:06.780]  Man faces five years in prison for releasing balloons.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:09.140]  And people say that's infowars.com.
[02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:12.340]  We'll go to the bottom and then click on the Sun Sentinel newspaper.
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:16.960]  He's facing five to seven years for releasing three heart-shaped balloons.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:19.400]  Yeah, so that's the new bar.
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  For environmental crimes.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:21.400]  Yeah, so if you release balloons.
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.540]  And he wouldn't be able to have guns because he let those balloons go.
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:28.140]  Because he would have a felony if he's charged with that.
[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:31.500]  And on that same account, we can go to clip number seven here.
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:37.660]  And this is Asa Bail talking about the slippery slope of gun registration.
[02:26:37.660 --> 02:26:38.660]  Here it is.
[02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:45.360]  I would really like to see an anti-gun trafficking federal law to keep people from trafficking
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:48.100]  guns to folks that shouldn't have them.
[02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:53.220]  Now I know that Alex and a lot of his viewers are worried about that slippery slope.
[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:57.140]  But like I've told Alex before, and I feel this in my heart of hearts, the right to bear
[02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:59.260]  arms has been part of our nation's history.
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:01.700]  I mean, it was a huge part of our nation's history.
[02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:03.900]  It's something that we have to support.
[02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:09.060]  But we protect it by taking common sense steps to do a better job of keeping guns out of
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:10.380]  the wrong people's hands.
[02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:15.120]  Over there in Colorado, in Aurora, where he's, I mean, that guy would have been nice to be
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:19.020]  able to have something where we could at least take possession of those firearms for safe
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:21.660]  keeping until they can work through their issues.
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:22.660]  So there you go.
[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:28.160]  He said, I at least like to have access to those guns temporarily, pre-crime, because
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:29.160]  he had-
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:31.580]  But meanwhile, he was planning it.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:33.660]  He told everyone it's now come out in court.
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:35.140]  He was on seven drugs.
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:36.140]  Right.
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:40.980]  In a mind control DARPA program, gee, wonder why the top Air Force psych warfare specialist
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:41.980]  didn't tell the police.
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:46.700]  But now, because it's on record, goes, well, I did, they never stop them.
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:48.020]  I wonder why.
[02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:50.180]  And Adam Lanza had his guns illegally.
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:51.820]  He tried to buy guns five times.
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:52.820]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:52.820 --> 02:27:54.300]  But look at what Acevedo is doing.
[02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:56.500]  He's on the typical Democrat talking points.
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:28:01.020]  He comes out and he says, we want you to have, we only want to take guns away from criminals,
[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:02.420]  people who are convicted felons.
[02:28:02.420 --> 02:28:05.700]  We're going to give them due process and then they shouldn't have guns anymore because they've
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:08.340]  been judged to be dangerous to the community.
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:12.220]  Something like Jokari just pointed out, a felony is not what you think of as a felony.
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:16.100]  It could be releasing a couple of balloons on the beach and then getting hit with a felony
[02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:17.100]  charge.
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:20.820]  It could be from the interview that you had earlier this week, Jokari, with Antonio Beeler.
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:21.820]  Yeah.
[02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:26.700]  And Alex, you know that situation, he was arrested for filming police attacking somebody
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:27.700]  else-
[02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:28.700]  Here in Austin.
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:29.700]  Yeah, here in Austin.
[02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:30.700]  And then he was attacked by the police.
[02:28:30.700 --> 02:28:31.700]  This is all on camera.
[02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:32.700]  We've shown it on info.
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:33.700]  He's backing away.
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:34.700]  They say he assaulted them.
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:35.700]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:36.700]  And then they say that he spit on them.
[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:38.660]  They say that the police are wrestling him to the ground.
[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:42.540]  He adds his hands up like this, you know, like I'm not resisting and they try to slam
[02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:43.540]  them to the ground.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:47.860]  A pretty pathetic attempt, if I might add so myself, but they're trying to slam the
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:51.460]  guy to the ground and he said, I'm not resisting, but you know, now they're trying to charge
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:53.700]  him with felonies for filming police.
[02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:54.700]  And then they'll get his guns.
[02:28:54.700 --> 02:28:55.700]  Don't worry.
[02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:56.940]  And Acevedo supported that.
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:28:58.620]  He supported the officers who are lying.
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:28:59.620]  Okay.
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:01.260]  And he pushed for maximum charges on this guy.
[02:29:01.260 --> 02:29:02.840]  And it's always, oh, we love the veterans.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.420]  The truth is they hate him because he's an army ranger, you know, from Iraq and Kosovo.
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:09.420]  Yeah.
[02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:10.420]  We'll show you.
[02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:11.420]  Yeah.
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:13.100]  But it's exactly, you know, what we're talking about.
[02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:17.460]  They're taking a fundamental right and they're turning it into a government granted privilege.
[02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:21.460]  And first he tells people, don't worry, we're only going to take rights away from convicted
[02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:22.460]  felons.
[02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:26.540]  But then later he turns it to anybody that a psychiatrist points a finger at.
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:29.780]  And that's what they're calling for, that they have a bill in the Texas legislature
[02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:33.620]  where the police just say they think you're acting mentally ill and your guns are gone.
[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:34.620]  Exactly.
[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:37.180]  I mean, that's Soviet Union, but it's okay.
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:39.340]  Cause Ardis Aveda is so nice.
[02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:41.460]  And that's what, oh, he's a friendly guy.
[02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:42.740]  He is a friendly guy.
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:43.740]  I'll give him that.
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:45.100]  He is a friendly guy.
[02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:46.820]  Just don't turn your back on him.
[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:50.380]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:51.660]  We're on the march.

[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:06.420]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:40.140]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:44.700]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:48.700]  skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:09.700]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:14.420]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons, but how will these items

[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:29.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live, going to your calls here in a moment.
[02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:33.700]  We're just seeing a rampage of authoritarianism out there on every front, so many fronts I
[02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:37.940]  can't even keep track of, but we're gonna go to Dean, Paul, Kent, Mark, Sean, and others
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:38.940]  here in a moment.
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:40.940]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:40.940 --> 02:33:44.060]  Gentlemen, let's get to some more of these clips.
[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:45.060]  What's up next, Sha'Carri?
[02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:48.540]  Well, actually, we have the last clip, and I'll let David introduce this one because
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:50.020]  he actually asked the question.
[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:53.260]  Well, basically, we just wanted to see if he's having trouble getting ammunition.
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:56.900]  There's reports, it was actually linked to Drudge, I think two or three days ago, where
[02:33:56.900 --> 02:33:59.420]  they were talking about police departments couldn't get ammunition.
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:02.180]  The Tennessee Highway Patrol couldn't get ammunition.
[02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:06.220]  The lead story was some police department, where they're putting off their qualification
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:07.660]  because they couldn't get sufficient ammunition.
[02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:12.140]  So I asked Art Acevedo if the Austin Police Department was having any trouble getting
[02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:13.140]  ammunition.
[02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:14.140]  Here's what he said.
[02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:15.140]  One quick one.
[02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:17.660]  Are you having any trouble getting ammunition?
[02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:19.620]  No, actually, no.
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:23.540]  So when we heard that, we went out and we looked around Austin to see if we could buy
[02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:25.700]  any ammunition from sporting goods stores.
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:26.700]  Slim pickings.
[02:34:26.700 --> 02:34:27.700]  Yeah.
[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:28.700]  And that piece is tonight.
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:30.740]  No, it'll be tomorrow night.
[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:31.740]  Tomorrow night.
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:36.580]  So this year, I was in an academy about a month ago buying ammo.
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:41.340]  And you have to go to the front register to get one box of 2-2-3, 3-0-8, or 40, or 9,
[02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:42.420]  all the government stuff.
[02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:46.180]  And I was told by the guys behind the counter, well, trucks come in, there's guys waiting.
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:48.520]  Sometimes it's the police, we try to help them out.
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:52.740]  You found one article out of East Texas where the gun shop said they give cops preferential
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:53.740]  treatment.
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:57.880]  So I sent you over there to see, A, let's show people there's real, cuz I told Watson
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:02.580]  about this, actually it was a month and a half ago before anybody had the news that
[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:03.840]  they were rationing ammo.
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:06.740]  And for whatever reason, he's a great writer, he had too much on his plate.
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:10.580]  Now it's news, but I was there at academy and then I called around at other academies
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:11.980]  and they go, no, you get one box.
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:13.820]  You guys experienced that same thing, correct?
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:15.740]  Yeah, we did some hidden camera stuff.
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:17.020]  I believe we all went out.
[02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:21.380]  I went to one of the academies here in Austin and I go to the front counter.
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:26.140]  Well, first I go back to the gun bar and they're more the desired ammunition, your 2-2-3s,
[02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:27.140]  your 9 millimeters.
[02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:28.340]  They kept those up front.
[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:33.820]  So I go back up front to the customer service desk and I say, hey, do you have any 2-2-3s?
[02:35:33.820 --> 02:35:36.100]  They say, yes, but you can only buy one box.
[02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:37.460]  I was like, okay.
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:42.100]  So I pull out my money and the guy behind the cashier girl, he said, well, you can buy
[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:44.460]  two if you have somebody else buy one.
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:47.940]  But the cashier girl is telling me, no, this is our last box.
[02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:52.060]  So I'm like, okay, do you have one box or can I buy two if I'm with somebody else?
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:55.260]  Then the guy says, okay, just let the guy buy two, but I only had enough money for one
[02:35:55.260 --> 02:35:57.020]  so I just bought one.
[02:35:57.020 --> 02:35:58.020]  And-
[02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:00.780]  That was that Remington bore killer, 2-2-3.
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.300]  That's the one you saw we have back there in the office.
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:07.400]  So I mean, it definitely is bullet rationing and even they resorted to the point of lying
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:08.400]  to you.
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:11.060]  If you go in there and you want to get more than one box and just instead of saying, sir,
[02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:13.020]  you're going to get one box like, no, this is our last box.
[02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:17.140]  Well, see, I was told more because there was three guys and I bought a couple of shotguns.
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:20.700]  And one guy was shaking because it was me and they go, don't worry, he's just a weekend
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:21.700]  guy.
[02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:24.600]  And of course, all these listeners come up shaking my hand and I go, okay, I want that
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:29.780]  shotgun and I want that shotgun because you can't ever have enough shotgun semi-autos.
[02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:34.140]  And the guy's going, you can't have two, you can't have two, and I'm-
[02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:35.140]  Why can't you buy two?
[02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:39.560]  Well, he goes, we got to fill out an ATF report, wherever you buy two rifles.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.700]  And the manager goes, no, we don't.
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:45.060]  And I'm going, well, now tell me, how do I get 2-2-3 more than just one box?
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:48.460]  He goes, well, we weren't selling it right out of the truck to whoever got there first.
[02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:50.380]  We tried to help the police out first.
[02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:53.780]  So I think Ace Aveda, maybe he's getting from the feds Homeland Security.
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:54.780]  I mean-
[02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:55.780]  He's certainly got connections.
[02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:56.780]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:57.780]  He's up all week talking to Biden.
[02:36:57.780 --> 02:37:00.780]  And he's not just standing behind him, he's on the news with the Vice President.
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:01.780]  Yeah, and he's very confident.
[02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:03.620]  He said, no, I have no problems getting ammunition.
[02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:04.620]  El Diablo.
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:09.260]  We've seen the articles in other organizations, police organizations, where they're having
[02:37:09.260 --> 02:37:13.820]  trouble getting ammunition, some gun stores even making their own now, just to supply.
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:17.400]  And we have to understand too, we touched on it at the very end of the, just before
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:18.400]  the break.
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:22.140]  But the argument that he's using, the standard Democrat talking points is, don't worry, we're
[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:26.220]  only coming after dangerous felons, and they've had due process.
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:31.000]  But then as they talk, they spin it and say, and anybody that a psychiatrist deems to be
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.820]  dodgy, a little bit dodgy.
[02:37:32.820 --> 02:37:38.020]  So now it's not a court, it's the psychiatrist, psychologist that are public drug reps pushing
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:39.020]  drugs on kids.
[02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:43.740]  Their answer is, all our Prozac heads keep shooting everybody up, so now let's put more
[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:44.740]  people on it.
[02:37:44.740 --> 02:37:49.360]  And you lose due process, and not only does that person lose due process, but everybody
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:51.260]  in the household loses due process.
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:55.020]  Remember, there's that story that we covered, I don't remember where it was, but the kid
[02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:56.020]  had-
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:57.020]  The water gun.
[02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:58.020]  The water gun.
[02:37:58.020 --> 02:37:59.020]  And they went in and confiscated the dad's guns.
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:03.260]  Well, that was on Monday, the bullies are beating them up so they joke, we could squirt
[02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:04.260]  them with water guns.
[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:06.860]  I brought water guns to school, you name it.
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:10.140]  We threw footballs at each other all day, I mean, whatever, whereas they banned dodgeball.
[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:11.460]  There it is right there on the screen.
[02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:12.460]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:15.140]  And they come to the house, they go, well, when he moves out when he's 18, the kid's
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:16.700]  10, you can have your guns back, maybe.
[02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:20.700]  Yeah, took $6,500 worth of guns from him, just confiscated him.
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:21.700]  This is something-
[02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:25.060]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, just the police or God.
[02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:29.780]  Because they had registration information on him, they knew that he had a gun.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.980]  Because there were other kids, they didn't go after the other family.
[02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:33.460]  And again, that's Long Island.
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:37.020]  So the issue here is, they just do whatever they want now.
[02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:38.020]  Yeah.
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:39.180]  I mean, there's not even a law to do that.
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:41.740]  And they want that nationwide, just color of law.
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:44.220]  Folks, tyranny is when they do whatever they want.
[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:47.800]  And it's here, and by the way, you notice they're announcing, we're gonna take the federal
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:52.520]  pension funds to prop up the derivatives now, and we're gonna take your 401k now, or part
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.520]  of it.
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.180]  And you know what, there is that new thing on investments, that new extra tax, and there
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:59.500]  is that payroll tax on poor people.
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:00.500]  Right.
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:04.140]  And I mean, how long can they get away with this level of con artistry?
[02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:08.380]  I just don't get why people can't see it, cuz I used to work for the city of Tulsa back
[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.500]  when I still lived in Oklahoma.
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.540]  And when I was coming in and filling out all my paperwork, they asked me, would you like
[02:39:13.540 --> 02:39:15.960]  to invest in the retirement plan?
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:19.900]  And I'd just seen on 60 Minutes, it was some town, I can't remember where it was, they
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:24.020]  just came in and took everybody's retirement plans who worked for the city for 30 plus
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:25.020]  years.
[02:39:25.020 --> 02:39:27.700]  So ladies looking at me across the desk like, do you wanna sign up for our retirement plan?
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:29.220]  I thought, I'm not gonna be a retirement plan.
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:31.540]  You know why they think it's all about to collapse?
[02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:35.100]  You got hundreds of cities, even some big ones going under, not just in Michigan, but
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:37.700]  California, you name it.
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:41.300]  In the last three, four years, the city managers and three or four other key people, some of
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:44.620]  them getting paid $100,000 a year in even small towns that's come out in California.
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:47.340]  Doesn't somebody in California make more money than Obama?
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:51.300]  No, no, there's a city manager in a small town that made 800,000.
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:52.300]  Why not?
[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:53.300]  I mean, they do whatever they want.
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:57.740]  Guys type in, California bureaucrats paid 800,000, it was like 844,000.
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:03.120]  But the point is, they've quietly moved into other private pension funds that they know
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:04.120]  have been protected.
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:07.060]  And they're gonna loot everybody else's.
[02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:10.980]  I mean, you cops following these criminal's orders, you really think you're gonna take
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:13.460]  our guns and not have everything you've got taken?
[02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:18.100]  Mexico has tripled the resources in major studies you can look up that the US does.
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:23.740]  Oil, gold, timber, soils, volcanic, I mean, the whole thing, except for a little bit of
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:26.180]  the north, is the best soil in the world.
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:32.420]  And Mexico, Mexico can't get anything going because the El Jefe's don't want people doing
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:33.420]  well.
[02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:40.620]  Yeah, there it is, there it is, who reportedly had a combined salary of 1.6 million.
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:45.180]  Oscar Hernandez, the mayor of Bell, California, and the city council accepted the resignation.
[02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:51.340]  The city manager, Robert Rizzo, assistant city manager, Angela, how do you say that,
[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:57.860]  Spasiza, and police chief, Randy Adams, who reportedly had a combined salary of 1.6 mil.
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:40:59.820]  And see, that's not even the worst one.
[02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:03.580]  People in California finally went, you're taking my house for property taxes cuz I can't
[02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:04.580]  pay it?
[02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:07.020]  Does it have a medical issue or whatever, and the insurance won't cover it?
[02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:11.860]  You're taking my house and you make $800,000 a year in a town of 50,000 people?
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:15.080]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:16.080]  That's exactly how it works.
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.980]  And we've already seen precedents of this.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:23.300]  In Illinois, they had the teacher's union, and the teacher's employees had a state pension.
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:27.340]  And of course, the state comes in and borrows against it to the hilt.
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:31.180]  And that was one of the things that they came in and said, let's try to, they actually voted,
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:33.840]  the teachers actually voted to have private pensions.
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:37.700]  So they would actually have an account with their name on it, and they had transparency
[02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:38.780]  to see what was there.
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:41.380]  But now they're gonna come after the private pensions.
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:42.380]  And they're not gonna borrow it.
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:43.380]  They're just gonna take it.
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:44.900]  Well, look at Europe in the final orgy.
[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:47.940]  They're going after the billionaires now who aren't on the inside group and taking all
[02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:48.940]  their money.
[02:41:48.940 --> 02:41:50.940]  And it turns out the really insider guys are all tax-exempt.
[02:41:50.940 --> 02:41:56.620]  Yeah, because they're giving you a haircut while they just rip money out of your account.
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:59.480]  And it's amazing to me that people don't think that it can happen here.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:03.020]  Notice the first week they reported on it, and now you never hear about it again?
[02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:06.140]  And they took 100% of some accounts.
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:07.140]  Yeah.
[02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:08.140]  Cuz why not?
[02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:09.140]  They got away with 10%?
[02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:11.420]  Cuz there's no guns in Cyprus, only the government has them.
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:15.140]  And boy, I've talked to folks that have been to Cyprus, it's highly paramilitary.
[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:18.380]  You know, soldier cops with machine guns, but you don't have them.
[02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:19.380]  And guess what?
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:20.380]  You don't have your bank account either.
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:21.380]  Wow.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:25.180]  All right, I wanna go to some phone calls, but we never got to clip number two, which
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:32.300]  I guess is a repeat of Martinez and I guess Art Acevedo.
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:35.460]  I think the biggest thing is that they went out and intimidated the two guys with pro
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:36.460]  gun signs.
[02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:37.460]  Mm-hm.
[02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:40.060]  A lady hits them in the back.
[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:41.060]  It's weird, I mean, I love women.
[02:42:41.060 --> 02:42:42.060]  They're heckling.
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:43.060]  It's weird how women will hit you.
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:44.060]  They'll kind of just like eat like that.
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:48.660]  She like pow with her fingers, hits him, and then they cuss at him, and then he's bad cuz
[02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:49.660]  they did that.
[02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:52.660]  Yeah, and they're heckling the guy, and I don't know if it's in that clip, but you can
[02:42:52.660 --> 02:42:56.140]  hear one of the ladies saying, is this your bodyguard to the smaller guy?
[02:42:56.140 --> 02:42:59.860]  And they're making fun of him, and you can obviously see him there covering his sign,
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:00.860]  but they're the bad guys.
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:04.820]  And then Acevedo comes over and leans into him.
[02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:05.820]  What do you think?
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:06.820]  This is America?
[02:43:06.820 --> 02:43:07.820]  This is Cuba?
[02:43:07.820 --> 02:43:11.620]  Well, it's key to remember what Martinez said.
[02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:15.940]  When he got pushed and when he got his blood up, he said, we're gonna make your gun ban
[02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:17.260]  sign come true.
[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:20.340]  What's the one where our Acevedo says, I wanna confront Alex.
[02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:21.340]  I'm not taking the guns.
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:23.040]  I don't know if we have that one.
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:26.700]  We need that for the nightly news with that, then cutting to all the gun grabbers saying,
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:28.180]  once we register, we're gonna get them.
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:29.180]  Okay, we'll get that.
[02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:30.380]  And the registration- And it's so fake.
[02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:32.380]  He's like, how dare Alex say that?
[02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:33.380]  It's just so fake.
[02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:38.580]  Have you ever had your kids when they're stealing candy or something, and they try that thing
[02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:41.860]  of acting angry, and then you see the wrapper sticking out of their pocket?
[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:43.340]  I'm sorry.
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:49.180]  Well, the registration that he's proposing, that Democrats are proposing, is bad enough,
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:50.580]  even without all-out confiscation.
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:55.140]  We understand it is a step to confiscation, but it is gonna have immediate effect on a
[02:43:55.140 --> 02:43:58.340]  lot of people when you look at the way they're going around and already using registration
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:02.860]  information to grab your guns if they see something on Facebook that your son put on
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:04.800]  there about a squirt gun or something, right?
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:07.720]  So that's a serious step right there.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.220]  It's changing a fundamental right into a privilege.
[02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:15.060]  But outside of law, they're kicking kids out of school for their pastry looking like a
[02:44:15.060 --> 02:44:16.060]  gun.
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:17.060]  Right.
[02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:18.500]  Or a GI Joe toy or a Nerf gun.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:20.340]  I mean, they're just doing it.
[02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:21.720]  Like you said, brainwash.
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:22.720]  Turn people against guns.
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:25.780]  Yeah, when they locked down a school cuz you brought your Nerf gun.
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:27.420]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:31.860]  And we need to understand that these constitutional sheriffs that Acevedo attacked, these are
[02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:33.900]  elected officials, okay?
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:35.500]  Police chiefs are not elected.
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:37.500]  They're appointed bureaucrats, okay?
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:42.260]  And like Sheriff Max said, any gun law is illegal.
[02:44:42.260 --> 02:44:44.060]  And he did go to the Supreme Court.
[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:47.860]  He did fight the Brady bill all the way to the Supreme Court and he won.
[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:48.860]  So they just changed it.
[02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:49.860]  Right?
[02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:52.700]  You know, it's just amazing that we've gotten to this point.
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:54.260]  All right, let's go to the phone calls here.
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:56.500]  We're gonna go to Dean and Paul, Kent, Mark.
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:58.580]  Sean, thanks for calling in today.
[02:44:58.580 --> 02:45:01.380]  By the way, Info Wars Nightly News tonight.
[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:05.520]  We've got one of our reporter's first pieces on the street, it is incredible.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:10.380]  The majority of Austinites we talked to did not know what dihydrogen monoxide was.
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:13.020]  We've redone that piece that Penn and Teller did nine years ago.
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:14.820]  And they said, ban water.
[02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:19.860]  And then you guys are gonna go out and you're gonna get them to say, ban, what, sodium chloride
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:23.300]  and- Carbon dioxide, which you breathe out.
[02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:25.140]  Of course, the EPA's on board with that.
[02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:26.140]  Oh, they are, yeah.
[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:28.820]  It's just as ridiculous as banning water if you stop and think about it.
[02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:30.020]  Well, the plants would die.
[02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:34.420]  They've done the ice core samples, the lowest ever recorded are carbon dioxide.
[02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:37.500]  Plants grow faster, healthier, there's more oxygen, humans live longer.
[02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:38.500]  Absolutely.
[02:45:38.500 --> 02:45:39.580]  It's almost like the Earth's losing its atmosphere.
[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:44.180]  They think all those A-bombs and stuff they detonated, the US military in the 60s, the
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.500]  upper atmosphere may have blown holes in the atmosphere.
[02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:47.500]  But that's good.
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.500]  Just say the atmosphere is bad.
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:49.500]  Yeah.
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:50.500]  I mean, just kill everybody.
[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:51.500]  Kill babies.
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:53.380]  I mean, your kids don't belong to you.
[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:56.740]  No, and I saw the tweet, I think we posted on Infowars.com.
[02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:59.420]  She goes, Jesus says I love you.
[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:02.100]  Which I'm sure he does love her, but I mean, regardless-
[02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:03.580]  It's just a flippant thing.
[02:46:03.580 --> 02:46:07.780]  Your kids belong to the collective now, it's like you're joining the Borg.
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:12.040]  And then you're not allowed to even criticize, she goes, I forgive my enemies.
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.340]  That is nothing new, though.
[02:46:13.340 --> 02:46:16.060]  That's a Ford Foundation deal where they go, I'm with Jesus.
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:19.540]  Yeah, but I mean, that whole thing about your kids belonging to the state, that goes all
[02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:20.780]  the way back to Plato's Republic.
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:21.780]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:24.300]  He had absolute control over everybody, and he wanted to destroy the family.
[02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:28.240]  He didn't want anyone to even know who their parents were, so the state could completely
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:29.240]  control them.
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:30.240]  That was his prescription.
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:31.240]  And that's what North Korea's done.
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:35.660]  And then some guys accuse me for talking about the allegory of the cave, that I support Plato.
[02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:37.780]  That's how dumbed down even pseudo-intellectuals are.
[02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:41.620]  If I go, it's like Plato's allegory of the cave, which is a really good allegory, then
[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:42.780]  I support Plato.
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:47.380]  I mean, it's just like, I never knew I was that smart.
[02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:49.220]  You guys feel like you're super smart, it's just normal.
[02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:51.980]  The general public's a bunch of idiots.
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:54.300]  I don't know.
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:55.300]  We have the calls.
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:47:00.060]  Absolutely, Jacari, look at that, Jacari, which means friend of callers.
[02:47:00.060 --> 02:47:03.740]  Let's go to Dean in Virginia, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:09.060]  Hello, Dean, good thing I didn't go to him, he's not there.
[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:12.780]  I wanted to hear what Dean had to say, John, are you there up at the network?
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:16.940]  Yeah, we've lost talk back to the network in Minnesota.
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:21.420]  So that's what that reason, we may not be able to take callers, so see, it's magic.
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:26.580]  Again, Genesis, can you hear me, have we even been off the air a while or who even knows
[02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:27.580]  what's going on?
[02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:29.940]  Yeah, we're reconnecting with the network.
[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:33.420]  And I want to hear what you have to say, Dean, so don't, oh, the call system is locked up
[02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:34.420]  in here.
[02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:38.500]  So that's why we got to keep scanning, like we're air traffic controllers, scanning, scanning,
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:39.500]  scanning.
[02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:41.660]  Let's talk about this constitutional sheriff stuff.
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:44.340]  I mean, you know, we need to get behind these sheriffs.
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:47.820]  We need to have someone who is going to stand with the law.
[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:53.060]  And you know, we don't need the Supreme Court to tell us what the meaning of not being fringed
[02:47:53.060 --> 02:47:54.060]  is.
[02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:55.060]  We pretty well can understand that.
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:59.780]  And you know, going all the way back to when this was first, the first idea came out here,
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:04.260]  Marbury versus Madison, that was where they established the fact that they were going
[02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:07.460]  to have the Supreme Court review all the laws.
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:09.460]  That was not an established fact.
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:13.240]  Jefferson attacked that from the very beginning and said, if you do that, you've turned the
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:16.220]  Constitution into a suicide pact.
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:21.000]  That's a, let me read a quote from him, he says right here, in denying the right they
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.380]  usurp of exclusively explaining the Constitution, and he's saying that the Supreme Court should
[02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:31.300]  not exclusively explain the Constitution, he says, intending to establish three departments,
[02:48:31.300 --> 02:48:35.300]  coordinate and independent, that they may check and balance one another, it's been given
[02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:39.180]  according to this opinion, that is Marbury versus Madison, to one of them alone, that
[02:48:39.180 --> 02:48:43.900]  is the Supreme Court, the right to prescribe rules for the government of the others.
[02:48:43.900 --> 02:48:47.180]  And to that one too, which is unelected by an independent of the nation.
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:52.100]  In other words, these are politically appointed judges that are going to stand over and have
[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:54.940]  final say so over every law.
[02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:59.620]  And Jefferson said, that was not the checks and balances that we had for the federal government.
[02:48:59.620 --> 02:49:03.780]  Certainly isn't the checks and balances that are there with the people and with the states.
[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:05.300]  And that's what the 10th Amendment is about.
[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:09.180]  It says rights that have not been expressly or powers-
[02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:11.620]  Yeah, hey, hold on one second, I gotta be engineer on there too.
[02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:15.980]  Hey, guys, I've lost connection to the network, and I guess I need to get some intel on that.
[02:49:15.980 --> 02:49:24.380]  What's going on network?
[02:49:24.380 --> 02:49:26.380]  We're being hit by denial of service?
[02:49:26.380 --> 02:49:31.380]  All right, all right, well, I just wanna get on the phone with you and make sure that was
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:32.380]  happening.
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:33.380]  All right, I'm engineer too.
[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:34.380]  All right, thanks.
[02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:36.660]  All right, well, we can't go to the phone calls.
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:37.660]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:42.860]  Well, the bottom line is that what Acevedo was saying when he attacked the constitutional
[02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:47.540]  sheriffs was he was saying, you have to do everything that the Supreme Court says.
[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:52.820]  Well, the Supreme Court and everyone at the federal level is subordinate to the Constitution,
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:53.820]  and we-
[02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:55.340]  Yeah, so what if we got a gang of nine?
[02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:58.980]  What if a foreign government got kids like sleeper cells, which is why we said you had
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:02.040]  to be natural born here to be president, that used to happen in Europe.
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:05.880]  What if you got a Manchurian Supreme Court that then said you have to sacrifice your
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:07.500]  children on their fifth birthday?
[02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:10.660]  Well, that's the Supreme Court, let's do that.
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:15.700]  I mean, it's the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, which never fully got enforced, i.e. slavery
[02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:18.260]  and stuff, until people did enforce it.
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:22.340]  You see, people say the Constitution Bill of Rights failed because they hate it because
[02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:24.420]  it's the best thing ever created in history.
[02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:27.180]  And talking about the Bill of Rights, there's a lady, I'm not sure if we have it in our
[02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:31.140]  clips or not, but she had a sign that said, what amendment protects our children from
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:32.140]  the Second Amendment?
[02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:35.260]  And I'm like, how many times have you been saved or somebody in your family has been
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:36.260]  saved?
[02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:38.740]  Or even if you didn't know it, just because let's say a police officer comes up, they're
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:42.660]  not afraid of the police officer, they're afraid of the gun on his hip.
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:45.740]  That's why when the police officer pulls out the gun, the people start running.
[02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:48.740]  But for some reason, it's the Second Amendment's fault, yeah.
[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:52.540]  All right, folks, we've got like triple redundancy backed up to the network up in Minnesota,
[02:50:52.540 --> 02:50:55.060]  but occasionally one of the connections cuts out, we're not aware of it.
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:59.300]  So that caller was probably there on air going, hello, hello, hello, and I'm just sitting
[02:50:59.300 --> 02:51:00.300]  there going, ooh.
[02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:01.620]  So we're going to come back.
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:02.980]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:51:02.980 --> 02:51:07.620]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,
[02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:09.160]  and more into the Bokashi.
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:12.740]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:17.100]  the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.
[02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:21.660]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:23.020]  using fertilizers.
[02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:27.500]  The EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System, rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system
[02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:31.640]  uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense
[02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:35.580]  humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:08.540]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:14.700]  home from home who's watching out for intruders.

[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:05.340]  Box.

[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:13.060]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:17.380]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:22.940]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:28.000]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:33.140]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:34.280]  normal cell.

[02:54:11.180 --> 02:54:14.140]  We're going to go into overdrive a little bit with the nightly news crew and then we'll
[02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:15.140]  be back tonight.
[02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:18.100]  I'm hosting the news, but you guys are doing some of the interviews and reviewing some
[02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:23.220]  of the great films that are coming in on the $115,000 Paul Revere contest we're running.
[02:54:23.220 --> 02:54:27.940]  Don't forget, folks, we take the money that comes in here to get crew, research, films
[02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:28.940]  to fight the globalists.
[02:54:28.940 --> 02:54:29.940]  We want to win.
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:30.940]  That's what we're after.
[02:54:30.940 --> 02:54:32.660]  What makes our boat float?
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:33.660]  Fighting tyranny.
[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:35.660]  I mean, because the tyrants are a bunch of crooks.
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:39.780]  I mean, if you don't have an instinct to fight them, something's wrong with you.
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:44.260]  And so buy the books, buy the videos, buy your storable high quality seeds from us,

[02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:08.880]  graphics and articles as well.
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:12.380]  The latest issue is the hoax issue exposing all the government hoaxes.
[02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:14.740]  Kent in Mississippi, then Paul, Mark and Sean.
[02:55:14.740 --> 02:55:16.940]  Kent, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:17.940]  Welcome.
[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:19.940]  Alex, how are you doing?
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:20.940]  Good, sir.
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:21.940]  Welcome.
[02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:22.940]  All right.
[02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:23.940]  I just got a couple of points I just wanted to make.
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:30.420]  Just been awake for a few years now and I've got to work every single day preaching, trying
[02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:37.380]  to show people just search engine, Operation Northwoods, Gladio, Ajax, et cetera.
[02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:42.900]  The UN, David Spangler, no one went into the New World Order without taking a Luciferian
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:43.900]  pledge.
[02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:47.660]  Why can't people understand, you know, AKA the New World Order, you know, they're taking
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:48.660]  over the planet.
[02:55:48.660 --> 02:55:53.060]  I've gone to congressional records seeing these famous quotes and they're in there going,
[02:55:53.060 --> 02:55:55.340]  we will have to pay for the New World Order in blood.
[02:55:55.340 --> 02:55:56.860]  We pledged to Lucifer.
[02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:58.900]  I mean, I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:55:58.900 --> 02:56:02.900]  Well, let's look at, you know, I was just going to say you made that montage, I think
[02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:05.620]  it was last week, the week before, and people keep saying there's no New World Order.
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:09.620]  And you lined up all these clips showing that all these people have called for a New World
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:14.120]  Order or a world government, which defines it as a world government.
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.740]  And then Joe Biden goes, I want a New World Order, but it doesn't exist.
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:18.740]  Pretty much.
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:20.020]  Let's look at the UN arms trade treaty.
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:22.420]  This is something that they've been planning for quite some time.
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:26.720]  They had this coming up for a vote in July, but they were still really getting hit with
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:28.580]  this fast and furious scandal, right?
[02:56:28.580 --> 02:56:31.580]  So they pushed that and they said, we'll do that after the election, and they ran the
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:32.900]  false flags, right?
[02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:35.180]  What does your gut tell you about Sandy Hook and Aurora?
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:36.180]  I think they're false.
[02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:37.780]  Yeah, I think they're false flags.
[02:56:37.780 --> 02:56:39.740]  The timing was just too suspicious.
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:43.180]  They did that one week exactly before they were going to have the UN vote.
[02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:45.220]  Well, they should have gotten better actors, too.
[02:56:45.220 --> 02:56:46.220]  Yeah, it did.
[02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:47.660]  It's the worst actors I've ever seen.
[02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:51.560]  It didn't really overcome the narrative and the news that was going on with Fast and Furious
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:54.620]  because Republicans were really hitting that for political gain just before the election.
[02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:57.380]  So they said, we're going to come back after the election so abruptly.
[02:56:57.380 --> 02:57:02.240]  I was up there at the UN, we were filming just for this very issue with another group,
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:05.100]  and they pulled it out abruptly two days before.
[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:06.100]  They said, that's it.
[02:57:06.100 --> 02:57:07.940]  We're going to come back after the election.
[02:57:07.940 --> 02:57:12.400]  They came back the very day of the election, and they were ready to do this in the lame
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:13.820]  duck session if they needed to.
[02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:17.100]  But because Obama and the Democrats were having a good election, they said, we're going to
[02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:19.720]  revisit this in March when they've got even stronger.
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:21.620]  And magically, what came next?
[02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:26.980]  Yeah, and the thing about Sandy Hook is when we went out to this recent rally, we're asking
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:30.980]  Acevedo and even some other people, and Sandy Hook was the thing that nobody really wanted
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:32.020]  to talk about.
[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:35.100]  Every time we brought the question to someone, it's like, well, I don't know too much about
[02:57:35.100 --> 02:57:36.100]  that shooting.
[02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:37.100]  I don't know too much about that shooting.
[02:57:37.100 --> 02:57:39.900]  But I'll tell you about Virginia Tech, I'll tell you about the Aurora shooting.
[02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:42.860]  I was like, why doesn't anybody want to talk about Sandy Hook when it's the new thing that's
[02:57:42.860 --> 02:57:44.900]  pushing the new agenda out there?
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:48.700]  Well, I mean, most of those people, because I've been to literally, let's not exaggerate,
[02:57:48.700 --> 02:57:51.300]  20 of the 10 bureaucrat marches.
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:55.740]  And I mean, it's all either kind of mental patients they bring along, or it's government
[02:57:55.740 --> 02:57:57.620]  workers, or it's actual globalist agents.
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:01.780]  Oh, yeah, man, I think the reason they didn't want to talk about Sandy Hook when they're
[02:58:01.780 --> 02:58:07.180]  pushing their registration agenda, I mean, this is the guy who, regardless if you believe
[02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:11.660]  the official story, the official story says that the guy purchased, excuse me, stole the
[02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:12.900]  firearm from his mother.
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:14.420]  And they don't want to talk about that.
[02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:17.740]  Can you say, well, if you get stricter background checks, how's it gonna stop a guy from stealing
[02:58:17.740 --> 02:58:18.740]  a gun?
[02:58:18.740 --> 02:58:21.060]  They don't want to bring that up, but I think that's-
[02:58:21.060 --> 02:58:22.060]  Incredible.
[02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:23.780]  Info Wars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central tonight.
[02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:24.780]  I'm hosting it.
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:28.180]  These guys will be in there with more news and commentary, but we're gonna go to overdrive,
[02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:32.660]  and I promise I'm gonna shut up and go to Mark and Sean and Paul and Ron and a few others.
[02:58:32.660 --> 02:58:35.500]  Ron in New York, the retired cop, I need to call him.
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:36.500]  He's got some good intel for me.
[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:37.820]  I got his number in my cell phone.
[02:58:37.820 --> 02:58:38.820]  I haven't called him yet.
[02:58:38.820 --> 02:58:39.820]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:40.820]  Stay with us.
[02:58:40.820 --> 02:58:41.820]  Internet streams, infowars.com.
[02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:42.820]  Right now, video streams, prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:58:42.820 --> 02:58:55.180]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:58:55.180 --> 02:59:00.860]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:04.900]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:08.820]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:10.220]  The fact is you are.
[02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:11.380]  We all are.
[02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:13.900]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:59:13.900 --> 02:59:18.660]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:59:18.660 --> 02:59:22.420]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:23.860]  Be prepared before you need it.

[02:59:27.300 --> 02:59:29.680]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[03:00:18.580 --> 03:00:23.580]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:31.660]  All right, we're doing a couple of segments of overdrive here.
[03:00:31.660 --> 03:00:32.660]  Some stations carry it.
[03:00:32.660 --> 03:00:37.460]  For years I did a fourth hour, went back three hours, started the nightly news.
[03:00:37.460 --> 03:00:38.460]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:42.980]  Sha'Carri Jackson is in here with us along with David Knight, and in the next segment
[03:00:42.980 --> 03:00:46.740]  let's talk about one of our new reporters and the report that's coming out tonight.
[03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:50.540]  This is pretty hilarious, but also pretty scary, pretty bombshell.
[03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:52.420]  Let's go to Mark in Pennsylvania.
[03:00:52.420 --> 03:00:53.420]  You're on the air.
[03:00:53.420 --> 03:00:54.420]  Go ahead.
[03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:57.500]  Guys, guys, get your pen and paper, pen and paper.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:00.740]  I'm calling you from Philadelphia, but I'm originally from Missouri, Southern Missouri,
[03:01:00.740 --> 03:01:03.740]  Springfield to be precise.
[03:01:03.740 --> 03:01:06.660]  Something happened in Missouri right now.
[03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:09.900]  A couple of guys put together a Second Amendment Preservation Act.
[03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:15.900]  It's House Bill 436, Senate Bill 325, and the Tenth Amendment Center is calling it some
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:20.980]  of the most powerful legislation to come from any state in a long time concerning the Second
[03:01:20.980 --> 03:01:24.820]  Amendment, but also related to the Tenth Amendment, and here's why.
[03:01:24.820 --> 03:01:32.300]  Effectively, if you read the detail of the bills, it effectively nullifies the Firearms
[03:01:32.300 --> 03:01:35.820]  Control Acts of 1968 and 1934.
[03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:40.100]  I've been trying to get the word out to as many people as primarily Missourians to let
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:44.500]  them know to call their representatives, call their state senators, and hammer this down
[03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:48.700]  because this could be breakthrough legislation not only for Missouri, but for the rest of
[03:01:48.700 --> 03:01:51.980]  the states to follow suit.
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:52.980]  Sounds good to me.
[03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:56.220]  I mean, look, I called the Second American Revolution six months ago, and I said it'd
[03:01:56.220 --> 03:02:01.080]  be a states' rights movement, not to destroy the republic, but to recapture the republic
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:02.080]  and then re-upload it.
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:06.860]  It's like we gotta kick the virus out and then re-upload the software.
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:07.860]  Exactly.
[03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:08.940]  It's what we were just talking about before.
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:12.120]  We've gotta get behind constitutional sheriffs, and we've gotta get behind state legislators
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:15.320]  who are gonna stand for the Constitution, and more importantly, are gonna stand for
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:18.420]  our individual rights, which transcend even the Constitution.
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:21.300]  The Constitution recognizes- It only points out like the Ninth Amendment
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:24.780]  says, hey, all rights not listed here doesn't mean they don't exist.
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:26.860]  I mean, it's- Yeah, that's the thing.
[03:02:26.860 --> 03:02:30.740]  They wanna make your rights a privilege, as David keeps alluding to.
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:37.020]  Absolutely, man, that's a great point, caller, a great point, Mark.
[03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:41.140]  I hope that you'll, and don't just count on us to know about something, shoot a YouTube
[03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:42.840]  video.
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:47.140]  It's like the Veritas project guy said, very successful targeting the globalist.
[03:02:47.140 --> 03:02:50.180]  And he said, look, we need other people to do this.
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:51.620]  This is what's gonna beat them.
[03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:52.620]  Right.
[03:02:52.620 --> 03:02:56.260]  And we need to just, Obama's like swarm them, I need you to help me get the guns.
[03:02:56.260 --> 03:02:58.440]  That's cuz they don't have the people.
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:02.500]  I mean, literally, Obama's supporters on average, and again, I'm not a Republican, Republicans
[03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:06.260]  act like they're constitutional and have a lot of better ideas, but they're sold out
[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:07.260]  and controlled.
[03:03:07.260 --> 03:03:11.020]  And the Democrats, I mean, you've got to be really dumb to want to be a communist.
[03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:15.460]  I mean, you've got to be really dumb, and I think these clips get thrown away after
[03:03:15.460 --> 03:03:17.340]  you use them, like that state rep.
[03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:20.780]  I mean, these people are really dumb.
[03:03:20.780 --> 03:03:22.820]  What do you do when idiots are running things?
[03:03:22.820 --> 03:03:26.220]  Well, half of, well, I won't say half, but a good portion of his supporters aren't even
[03:03:26.220 --> 03:03:30.340]  real cuz we've shown those reports about how the Twitter followers and all this other stuff
[03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:31.340]  is cooked up.
[03:03:31.340 --> 03:03:33.060]  70 plus percent of Obamas are fake.
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:36.700]  Yeah, so I mean, they're not all there, but they get people like these mom groups every
[03:03:36.700 --> 03:03:39.340]  now and then to go out there and do a little dirty work for them.
[03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:40.340]  Well, we'll check those out.
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:43.740]  That's Missouri, and it's House Bill 436 and Senate Bill 235.
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:44.740]  Absolutely, Mark.
[03:03:44.740 --> 03:03:45.740]  Anything else?
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:52.340]  Well, I just, also, a friend of mine put together a website, it's 1776trumps1984.com, and you
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:53.700]  can find out more information.
[03:03:53.700 --> 03:03:55.280]  People can go there and download the flyer.
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:56.660]  They can pass them out.
[03:03:56.660 --> 03:03:57.660]  It's a pretty neat flyer.
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.460]  It's got a colonial guy with the AK-47.
[03:03:59.460 --> 03:04:03.460]  I wonder where you thought of that, 1776 trumps 1984.
[03:04:03.460 --> 03:04:06.240]  I love it.
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:09.540]  You gotta come up with a weird card deck that has stuff like that on it.
[03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:13.340]  Not just here's the bad New World Order guy, but funny stuff, you know?
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:15.380]  All right, brother, good to hear from you.
[03:04:15.380 --> 03:04:17.260]  I'm gonna check that site out.
[03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:20.080]  And again, please, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna go to break, come back into another
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:25.980]  segment with your calls for Sean and Ron and Paul and Alex and everybody with our guest
[03:04:25.980 --> 03:04:26.980]  host here.
[03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:29.020]  It's fun having you guys ride shotgun with me.
[03:04:29.020 --> 03:04:32.380]  Yeah, it's an interesting day.
[03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:36.580]  A day long remembered, we've seen the end of Kenobi.
[03:04:36.580 --> 03:04:39.340]  We'll soon see the end of the rebellion.
[03:04:39.340 --> 03:04:41.460]  I'm gonna stop it.
[03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:42.940]  I get a little dangy, Jacari.
[03:04:42.940 --> 03:04:43.940]  I know.
[03:04:43.940 --> 03:04:48.060]  Can you imagine some day, Jacari, not even knowing you're on the air and not even caring?
[03:04:48.060 --> 03:04:50.740]  I can see that day coming, yeah.
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.940]  I hear the train a coming.
[03:04:52.940 --> 03:04:59.300]  It's rolling around the bend and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck
[03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:00.620]  in Folsom Prison.
[03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:07.860]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:05:07.860 --> 03:05:12.940]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[03:05:12.940 --> 03:05:13.940]  front.
[03:05:13.940 --> 03:05:19.900]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:05:19.900 --> 03:05:20.900]  your help.
[03:05:20.900 --> 03:05:26.140]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:05:26.140 --> 03:05:32.140]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.140 --> 03:05:35.600]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:41.820]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.820 --> 03:05:49.260]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:49.260 --> 03:05:51.060]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.060 --> 03:05:53.180]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.180 --> 03:05:55.020]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.020 --> 03:06:01.340]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:03.300]  Chicago is a virtual battlefield.
[03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:07.460]  More than 500 shooting deaths in 2012 have made Chicago the murder capital of America.
[03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:09.100]  Proof that gun control doesn't work.
[03:06:09.100 --> 03:06:12.340]  Disarming law abiding citizens ensures that only criminals have guns.
[03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:15.580]  And Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Machine want to keep it that way.
[03:06:15.580 --> 03:06:18.440]  If we can't stop them in Chicago, we may lose the whole battle.
[03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:19.440]  But there's hope.
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:23.500]  On April 9th, we have a chance to send billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Rahm Emanuel and his Chicago
[03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:27.860]  Machine a crystal clear message that we have a natural right to defend ourselves, our homes
[03:06:27.860 --> 03:06:31.060]  and our families and that they need to keep their hands off our guns.
[03:06:31.060 --> 03:06:34.980]  Illinois Republican Paul McKinley is sending that message in a bitterly fought special
[03:06:34.980 --> 03:06:38.380]  election to replace disgraced ex-rep Jesse Jackson Jr.
[03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:42.080]  Every vote, every voice in support of Paul McKinley is a stand against the gun grabbing

[03:08:34.820 --> 03:08:37.180]  You guys were saying, can you really do it Darth Vader?
[03:08:37.180 --> 03:08:38.180]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[03:08:38.180 --> 03:08:41.020]  I can probably really do it.
[03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:45.700]  Max was surprised, your highness, you weren't on the mercy mission this time.
[03:08:45.700 --> 03:08:47.780]  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship.
[03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:50.860]  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
[03:08:50.860 --> 03:08:52.820]  This is a diplomatic ship.
[03:08:52.820 --> 03:08:55.460]  You are part of the rebel alliance and a traitor.
[03:08:55.460 --> 03:08:56.460]  Take her away.
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:08:58.460]  I'm just having fun.
[03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:06.260]  Why not have some fun while these gun grabbing bastards are running all over us, lying to
[03:09:06.260 --> 03:09:07.260]  us.
[03:09:07.260 --> 03:09:08.260]  You know what makes me the master?
[03:09:08.260 --> 03:09:12.580]  We are here to enslave you, lay down your arms and we'll kill you.
[03:09:12.580 --> 03:09:13.900]  Then we'd organize and defeat them.
[03:09:13.900 --> 03:09:15.780]  Instead it's like, we want to be your friend.
[03:09:15.780 --> 03:09:16.780]  No one wants to take your guns.
[03:09:16.780 --> 03:09:18.820]  We'll get you a little bastards gun as soon as we can.
[03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:20.140]  Oh, hi, we're your friends.
[03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:22.540]  I mean, I'm like, I'm sick of these people.
[03:09:22.540 --> 03:09:25.460]  Yeah, I think we all are.
[03:09:25.460 --> 03:09:27.180]  And that's what we saw this rally.
[03:09:27.180 --> 03:09:28.700]  That's what we saw everywhere this rally.
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:29.920]  I don't want your guns, right?
[03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:32.660]  And then we had the one Martinez said he did.
[03:09:32.660 --> 03:09:37.140]  Then everybody's here and is like, yeah, if we can get the guns, we'll take them.
[03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:38.140]  Yeah.
[03:09:38.140 --> 03:09:41.020]  They want to live like Chicago or New York.
[03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:42.020]  They love it.
[03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:43.020]  Yeah.
[03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:44.020]  Yeah.
[03:09:44.020 --> 03:09:47.180]  But let's understand that they're talking about taking due process from people right
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:48.900]  now with these registration bills.
[03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:53.020]  They're going to take that due process and you know, quote unquote, felons.
[03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:54.020]  Okay.
[03:09:54.020 --> 03:09:55.020]  People who let go of balloons.
[03:09:55.020 --> 03:09:56.020]  It's like, oh, just, just felons.
[03:09:56.020 --> 03:10:00.420]  And by the way, you're ready to process or even people who are alleged to be felons like
[03:10:00.420 --> 03:10:01.420]  Antonio Beeler.
[03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:02.420]  Yeah.
[03:10:02.420 --> 03:10:03.420]  Yeah.
[03:10:03.420 --> 03:10:04.420]  Sorry.
[03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:05.420]  Keep losing his last name there.
[03:10:05.420 --> 03:10:06.420]  No, no.
[03:10:06.420 --> 03:10:07.420]  He said everybody always makes fun of him.
[03:10:07.420 --> 03:10:08.420]  Yeah.
[03:10:08.420 --> 03:10:09.420]  Bueller from the Ferris Bueller.
[03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:10.420]  I mean, that's what it looks like.
[03:10:10.420 --> 03:10:11.660]  If you look at the guy's name.
[03:10:11.660 --> 03:10:16.900]  I know everybody I know says you pronounce it Bueller, but he goes, no, it's Bueller.
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:18.980]  So it's like potato, patata, right?
[03:10:18.980 --> 03:10:24.060]  But he got like red farm is really fab Faberge or something, but not that fancy, but you
[03:10:24.060 --> 03:10:25.700]  on the right, right track.
[03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:29.500]  But Antonio Bueller didn't cave and he started an organization here in Austin too.
[03:10:29.500 --> 03:10:32.060]  So I mean that, that, you know, he's taking action.
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:33.180]  I admire what he's doing.
[03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:34.420]  I was being sarcastic with him.
[03:10:34.420 --> 03:10:35.900]  I think he almost thought I was being serious.
[03:10:35.900 --> 03:10:36.900]  Yeah.
[03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:37.900]  I mean, they're teasing him.
[03:10:37.900 --> 03:10:41.860]  We need to realize that the guy that was the antagonist in this story where he was unjustly
[03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:46.460]  persecuted was our own Art Acevedo, the guy who said, don't worry, you've got nothing
[03:10:46.460 --> 03:10:47.460]  to fear.
[03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:48.460]  We can.
[03:10:48.460 --> 03:10:49.460]  That's why the feds like him.
[03:10:49.460 --> 03:10:50.460]  They're like, wow, look at this guy.
[03:10:50.460 --> 03:10:51.460]  Yeah.
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:52.460]  He's like, nevermind this knife.
[03:10:52.460 --> 03:10:54.020]  I'm sliding into your freedom.
[03:10:54.020 --> 03:10:56.620]  Oh, see, it's air conditioned.
[03:10:56.620 --> 03:10:58.620]  It's cold blade, isn't it?
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:02.820]  And your body's going to be cold here politically real quick.
[03:11:02.820 --> 03:11:06.020]  Let me just draw this razor across your neck, America.
[03:11:06.020 --> 03:11:07.020]  I'm nice.
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:08.020]  I don't want it to be Cuba.
[03:11:08.020 --> 03:11:11.740]  I want it to be a new authoritarian state I run.
[03:11:11.740 --> 03:11:12.740]  That's Art Acevedo.
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:17.340]  Meanwhile, we've got families that have to escape to Cuba now in today's America, right?
[03:11:17.340 --> 03:11:21.180]  Because Cuba doesn't like to CPS your kids unless you really abused them.
[03:11:21.180 --> 03:11:22.180]  That's right.
[03:11:22.180 --> 03:11:23.420]  It's like we've outstretched them.
[03:11:23.420 --> 03:11:24.420]  Okay.
[03:11:24.420 --> 03:11:25.740]  Let's go to calls here.
[03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:29.020]  Let's talk to Sean in Canada, then Ron in New York while I'm gibbering.
[03:11:29.020 --> 03:11:30.020]  Go ahead.
[03:11:30.020 --> 03:11:31.020]  And Paul and others.
[03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:32.020]  Go ahead, Sean.
[03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:33.020]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:11:33.020 --> 03:11:34.020]  Great to talk to you.
[03:11:34.020 --> 03:11:35.020]  I'm a long time listener.
[03:11:35.020 --> 03:11:39.020]  I'm a Amazon Planet.tv member, a political science graduate, and thanks to you, I graduated
[03:11:39.020 --> 03:11:40.660]  with a stellar average.
[03:11:40.660 --> 03:11:44.060]  You really invigorated my interest in politics before you.
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:45.060]  Impressive.
[03:11:45.060 --> 03:11:46.060]  Most impressive.
[03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:47.060]  Well, God bless you, man.
[03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:51.420]  Before you, I thought history had been written, and like so many people, I thought we were
[03:11:51.420 --> 03:11:52.820]  at the end of history in a way.
[03:11:52.820 --> 03:11:54.580]  There was nothing new to discover.
[03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:58.200]  There were no secrets, and everything was hunky-dory, and it's just you've opened my
[03:11:58.200 --> 03:12:00.540]  eyes to a whole new world, and it's just amazing.
[03:12:00.540 --> 03:12:02.300]  Well, that's what I love to hear.
[03:12:02.300 --> 03:12:04.140]  I don't wake people up.
[03:12:04.140 --> 03:12:06.220]  You're the opposite of a cult.
[03:12:06.220 --> 03:12:07.860]  Cults tell you, this is how it is.
[03:12:07.860 --> 03:12:08.860]  You must only believe this.
[03:12:08.860 --> 03:12:10.260]  We say, open your eyes.
[03:12:10.260 --> 03:12:13.740]  Look at this, and that's what will defeat the globalists, because the New World Order
[03:12:13.740 --> 03:12:14.740]  is a cult.
[03:12:14.740 --> 03:12:16.860]  You've got to buy into their delusional lies.
[03:12:16.860 --> 03:12:18.180]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:12:18.180 --> 03:12:20.100]  What was your comment today?
[03:12:20.100 --> 03:12:21.380]  Tell you.
[03:12:21.380 --> 03:12:22.380]  Sorry?
[03:12:22.380 --> 03:12:23.380]  Dispense with the pleasantries.
[03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:24.380]  Oh, yes.
[03:12:24.380 --> 03:12:25.380]  Excuse me.
[03:12:25.380 --> 03:12:26.380]  Sorry.
[03:12:26.380 --> 03:12:29.580]  So, yeah, so I live in Canada, and it's just, you know, I'm a huge constitutionalist.
[03:12:29.580 --> 03:12:32.020]  I mean, like I said, I got my degree in politics.
[03:12:32.020 --> 03:12:34.740]  I lived in New York City, I have family in America.
[03:12:34.740 --> 03:12:37.900]  I love the U.S. Constitution Bill of Rights, I think it's the greatest document that the
[03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:40.140]  world has ever seen written by men.
[03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:42.540]  And yeah, I try to reach out to everybody.
[03:12:42.540 --> 03:12:46.580]  I tell all my friends, I talk to my friends, and everybody is just so close-minded, trusting,
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:50.580]  and naive, and they just, they cannot wrap their heads around the fact that they're in
[03:12:50.580 --> 03:12:51.580]  the world that they don't know.
[03:12:51.580 --> 03:12:54.900]  Well, remember, zombies have never, well, these are people brought up to television.
[03:12:54.900 --> 03:12:59.060]  They just kind of, and they're in a daze, literal brainwaves now, and so they're tuned
[03:12:59.060 --> 03:13:00.880]  in to suspended disbelief.
[03:13:00.880 --> 03:13:04.380]  So it's like the light, they're like, scary.
[03:13:04.380 --> 03:13:06.020]  They think of it as work.
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:10.300]  They haven't taken it personal yet that they're being enslaved, but it doesn't matter.
[03:13:10.300 --> 03:13:13.780]  It's always a minority that doesn't wanna be enslaved and that stands up.
[03:13:13.780 --> 03:13:18.020]  So don't feel bad, cuz some areas you run into, the majority's awake.
[03:13:18.020 --> 03:13:21.980]  And then you run into another area, believe me, you're not a public figure.
[03:13:21.980 --> 03:13:25.780]  If you were Alex Jones, and it's not bragging, hey, I'm a big shot, everywhere I go, people
[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:26.780]  come up.
[03:13:26.780 --> 03:13:27.780]  I mean, you've seen it.
[03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:30.940]  It's all to the point of like, I can't even on the hike and bike trail, I can't go to
[03:13:30.940 --> 03:13:33.980]  Barton Springs, I can't go to Mexico, people come up to me.
[03:13:33.980 --> 03:13:36.020]  And believe me, folks, they're out there.
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:40.540]  That's why you should wear an Infowars.com t-shirt, because then you'll meet like-minded
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:41.820]  people, plus it funds the operation.
[03:13:41.820 --> 03:13:42.820]  Go ahead, gentlemen.
[03:13:42.820 --> 03:13:46.060]  Well, one of the things is, when you look at these articles from CNN and other places,
[03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:49.300]  they don't usually have a reference to the other documents.
[03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:52.740]  When you look at an Infowars article, and we talk about something like ammunition purchases,
[03:13:52.740 --> 03:13:57.020]  we're going back and we're linking directly to those purchases so you can see it for yourself
[03:13:57.020 --> 03:14:01.700]  You can Google it, we've got the links there, so people can see the documents and they still
[03:14:01.700 --> 03:14:02.700]  deny them.
[03:14:02.700 --> 03:14:05.860]  Every year in August, they have articles in every local paper, I read them this year,
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:09.340]  or I guess last year, saying, it's the law.
[03:14:09.340 --> 03:14:16.640]  You must take the vaccines and there's no side effects, no links, obviously it's a newspaper,
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:18.820]  no bibliograph, according to such and such.
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:20.740]  You go online, the same thing on the newspaper.
[03:14:20.740 --> 03:14:25.740]  You go to our article, hundreds of university links, how it's gonna kill you, the copy of
[03:14:25.740 --> 03:14:26.740]  the insert.
[03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:27.740]  I mean-
[03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:31.660]  I don't know, they just like to say stuff about it, it's like, I believe it was a couple
[03:14:31.660 --> 03:14:33.740]  weeks ago, somebody wrote a hit piece on you.
[03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:38.820]  They said, Alex Jones has reported that TSA hires defrocked priests.
[03:14:38.820 --> 03:14:43.260]  And we have the articles on Infowars right now, but they didn't link to that.
[03:14:43.260 --> 03:14:47.460]  They say, they claim that you made it, you made that statement, but did not link to it.
[03:14:47.460 --> 03:14:48.460]  And that's the kind of things that they do.
[03:14:48.460 --> 03:14:53.740]  Well, even Patriot groups, ten years later ago, Jones claims he has footage of FEMA teaching
[03:14:53.740 --> 03:14:55.060]  the founding fathers are bad.
[03:14:55.060 --> 03:15:00.300]  I have where it was, Kansas City, the video, and the manual, and news articles about it.
[03:15:00.300 --> 03:15:01.300]  Right.
[03:15:01.300 --> 03:15:02.300]  Yeah.
[03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:03.300]  Yeah.
[03:15:03.300 --> 03:15:04.300]  We sell those clips.
[03:15:04.300 --> 03:15:05.300]  They want to call us paranoid.
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:06.300]  They want to say we're making stuff up.
[03:15:06.300 --> 03:15:07.300]  Bring it on.
[03:15:07.300 --> 03:15:08.300]  We'll show them the links.
[03:15:08.300 --> 03:15:09.300]  I mean, look at this right here.
[03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:12.540]  Time columnist warning others about government oppression is anti-American crap.
[03:15:12.540 --> 03:15:15.760]  They cannot have a debate about how this is an authoritarian takeover.
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:18.260]  They want to label cyanide mommy's milk.
[03:15:18.260 --> 03:15:21.740]  Sean, anything else?
[03:15:21.740 --> 03:15:28.020]  I want to say that every single legislator involved in voting for these bills and whatnot
[03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:31.220]  in trying to instill gun control is literally committing treason.
[03:15:31.220 --> 03:15:35.060]  I was reading an essay by a constitutional lawyer that I got off Oath Keepers.
[03:15:35.060 --> 03:15:36.060]  I've joined them as well.
[03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:37.060]  No, no.
[03:15:37.060 --> 03:15:38.060]  I mean, it is treason.
[03:15:38.060 --> 03:15:39.060]  It is sedition.
[03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:40.060]  I don't get up here.
[03:15:40.060 --> 03:15:44.660]  Look, it's criminal to knowingly get up there and lie and try to register guns with a plan
[03:15:44.660 --> 03:15:45.660]  to confiscate them.
[03:15:45.660 --> 03:15:49.340]  It is organized government fraud that has a name, tyranny.
[03:15:49.340 --> 03:15:50.340]  Thanks for the call.
[03:15:50.340 --> 03:15:53.100]  Paul in New York, then Paul in New Jersey.
[03:15:53.100 --> 03:15:55.700]  Ron, you're on the air, sir.
[03:15:55.700 --> 03:15:57.820]  Is this the retired cop that gives me so much good info?
[03:15:57.820 --> 03:15:58.820]  Yes, it is.
[03:15:58.820 --> 03:16:00.980]  And by the way, I'm going to try to call you today.
[03:16:00.980 --> 03:16:03.220]  I know I got your number and you've got some inside intel.
[03:16:03.220 --> 03:16:04.220]  I've been meaning to call you.
[03:16:04.220 --> 03:16:05.500]  I've just run out of time.
[03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:08.540]  What's your point on the orgy of evil you've been seeing?
[03:16:08.540 --> 03:16:12.820]  Well, here, case in point, in the state of New York, the other big shoe is dropped.
[03:16:12.820 --> 03:16:17.740]  We have now had the first case in the state of New York where the state police have ordered
[03:16:17.740 --> 03:16:22.500]  the seizure of somebody's firearms, who's a pistol permit holder, because he has some
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:30.180]  months past taken medication, a psychotropic medication for anxiety, even though the man
[03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:34.980]  was not deemed dangerous or mental defective or anything of that nature as a complete clean
[03:16:34.980 --> 03:16:35.980]  background.
[03:16:35.980 --> 03:16:36.980]  No, no, no.
[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:39.660]  They push it on you like drug dealers in a schoolyard and now they're announcing, that's
[03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:42.660]  our article you're talking about, that's on Drudge, that they're coming for our guns.
[03:16:42.660 --> 03:16:45.140]  And look, thank God I've never been on anything.
[03:16:45.140 --> 03:16:50.340]  I mean, I had a surgery and didn't want to take the opiate pills cuz they made me sick.
[03:16:50.340 --> 03:16:52.380]  You ain't got nothing on me, dirtbag government.
[03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:53.380]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:16:53.380 --> 03:16:54.380]  Go ahead, Ron.
[03:16:54.380 --> 03:16:57.220]  It's something they had absolutely no legal right to do.
[03:16:57.220 --> 03:17:03.220]  This is the suspicion that the police cross-reference a list of pistol permit holders with what
[03:17:03.220 --> 03:17:07.940]  we have in New York State, and you'll soon have in the nation with Obamacare, a medical
[03:17:07.940 --> 03:17:11.660]  prescription database that we have in there- No, no, that's in there and it was for the
[03:17:11.660 --> 03:17:12.660]  gun confiscation.
[03:17:12.660 --> 03:17:15.700]  It's a kind of declarance, all mentally defective.
[03:17:15.700 --> 03:17:23.020]  And what Ron just described is exactly what Acevedo wants to do here in Austin, in Texas.
[03:17:23.020 --> 03:17:26.360]  But we're supposed to like it and we're conspiracy theorists.
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:31.300]  Even though the Mayor Pro Tem is up there saying, we'll get your guns, I'll get you
[03:17:31.300 --> 03:17:33.420]  registered in your little dog too.
[03:17:33.420 --> 03:17:36.540]  Pretty much, I just got an email the other day from a guy, I can't remember where he
[03:17:36.540 --> 03:17:37.540]  was.
[03:17:37.540 --> 03:17:40.760]  But he said he called his mom talking about he was mildly depressed because he lost his
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:45.740]  job and then the SWAT team showed up at his house demanding that he come outside and turn
[03:17:45.740 --> 03:17:46.740]  in his fire off.
[03:17:46.740 --> 03:17:51.380]  This happened to G Gordon Liddy's producer like 15 years ago.
[03:17:51.380 --> 03:17:54.940]  She answered a survey or something that had her address on it and got put in for like
[03:17:54.940 --> 03:17:55.940]  a month.
[03:17:55.940 --> 03:18:02.980]  Gorgeous model, producer, famous, and they wrecked her life.
[03:18:02.980 --> 03:18:04.240]  This is the secret police.
[03:18:04.240 --> 03:18:08.260]  This is an industry that wants, they're not just gonna CPS little kids, they're gonna
[03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:10.260]  CPS adults.
[03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:11.260]  Exactly, yeah.
[03:18:11.260 --> 03:18:12.340]  Well, that's their cult.
[03:18:12.340 --> 03:18:17.820]  They had a Democratic Party operative in psychology today write a big cover story about how I'm
[03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:18.820]  insane.
[03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:21.180]  Yeah, insanely free, insanely alive.
[03:18:21.180 --> 03:18:25.820]  You're insanely politically dead, you're a pathetic creature.
[03:18:25.820 --> 03:18:27.220]  And he says I'm mentally ill.
[03:18:27.220 --> 03:18:30.840]  Well, that was always a tactic of Stalin and other dictators that say that people were
[03:18:30.840 --> 03:18:36.500]  insane and to commit them without any due process because people will stand for a lesser
[03:18:36.500 --> 03:18:39.900]  due process if you accuse somebody of being insane or you say that they're on a dangerous
[03:18:39.900 --> 03:18:43.940]  drug and yet we want to put the people who are prescribing these dangerous drugs in charge
[03:18:43.940 --> 03:18:46.140]  of determining who is sane.
[03:18:46.140 --> 03:18:51.300]  Well, there is a cult of white robes.
[03:18:51.300 --> 03:18:55.500]  The court in your pleadings, you worship to it, you pray for the folks that don't know,
[03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:56.500]  you pray in the pleading.
[03:18:56.500 --> 03:18:58.680]  You start praying in pleadings, you start winning.
[03:18:58.680 --> 03:19:02.660]  All these modern lawyers don't know it's about worshiping the court.
[03:19:02.660 --> 03:19:05.780]  It's a Roman court basically is what they've superimposed over our common law.
[03:19:05.780 --> 03:19:09.660]  So you worship the judge, you pray to the judge, you pray to the court, you can even
[03:19:09.660 --> 03:19:13.460]  throw some more stuff in there and they'll really get excited because it's like ancient
[03:19:13.460 --> 03:19:14.460]  commands.
[03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:18.420]  But the whole point is, I don't know why I even went off into that whole story, is that
[03:19:18.420 --> 03:19:19.420]  now it's not even going to be courts.
[03:19:19.420 --> 03:19:20.420]  They're just going to take your guns.
[03:19:20.420 --> 03:19:21.420]  Yeah.
[03:19:21.420 --> 03:19:22.420]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:19:22.420 --> 03:19:23.420]  That's what they want.
[03:19:23.420 --> 03:19:24.420]  Ron, anything else you want to add?
[03:19:24.420 --> 03:19:25.420]  Yes.
[03:19:25.420 --> 03:19:27.420]  There's quite a bit else I'd like to add.
[03:19:27.420 --> 03:19:30.820]  There was now with the UN Arms Treaty, okay?
[03:19:30.820 --> 03:19:31.820]  We're going to skip this break.
[03:19:31.820 --> 03:19:32.820]  Go ahead.
[03:19:32.820 --> 03:19:33.820]  We're going to skip this break.
[03:19:33.820 --> 03:19:34.820]  Go ahead.
[03:19:34.820 --> 03:19:39.460]  It's immaterial whether or not they ratify that treaty because the domestic laws that
[03:19:39.460 --> 03:19:45.220]  are presently being discussed in Congress comport with what is called for in the UN
[03:19:45.220 --> 03:19:46.220]  Arms Treaty.
[03:19:46.220 --> 03:19:47.220]  That's why they're trying to get it through.
[03:19:47.220 --> 03:19:48.300]  But I've read the treaty.
[03:19:48.300 --> 03:19:50.840]  It points to the directives in other agreements.
[03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:55.340]  We've done countless reports on this that says the state can have government.
[03:19:55.340 --> 03:19:57.300]  The state can have guns, not the people.
[03:19:57.300 --> 03:20:01.940]  So it says we don't interfere with state rights to guns, but state is defined as the United
[03:20:01.940 --> 03:20:02.940]  States.
[03:20:02.940 --> 03:20:03.940]  Go ahead.
[03:20:03.940 --> 03:20:04.940]  Go ahead, David.
[03:20:04.940 --> 03:20:05.940]  You want to say something?
[03:20:05.940 --> 03:20:06.940]  But the fact- No, go ahead.
[03:20:06.940 --> 03:20:07.940]  Let Ron go.
[03:20:07.940 --> 03:20:12.220]  It says, gentlemen, that whether they ratify that treaty or not, if this legislation that's
[03:20:12.220 --> 03:20:16.620]  being proposed and is supposedly going to be voted on in the U.S. Senate tomorrow passes,
[03:20:16.620 --> 03:20:17.980]  they get what they want.
[03:20:17.980 --> 03:20:21.260]  It's all the same thing in the end, and they know what they're doing.
[03:20:21.260 --> 03:20:25.120]  Now another thing, too, that I've just about had it with, and I think it's time that we
[03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:28.700]  be brave enough to step up as men and say this.
[03:20:28.700 --> 03:20:34.340]  We aren't insensitive beasts, but I believe five months of mindless emotionalism thrown
[03:20:34.340 --> 03:20:42.740]  at me constantly showing the families or so forth of Newtown is a bit enough.
[03:20:42.740 --> 03:20:46.300]  This is a social policy issue that should be thought through intelligently-
[03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:48.540]  Well, they're waving the bloody shirt.
[03:20:48.540 --> 03:20:50.060]  I appreciate your call, Ron.
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:54.980]  They're obviously 100% shamelessly doing this.
[03:20:54.980 --> 03:20:57.620]  It's about making us the bad guys.
[03:20:57.620 --> 03:21:00.100]  Hitler demonized groups before he went after him.
[03:21:00.100 --> 03:21:01.300]  Every authoritarian does this.
[03:21:01.300 --> 03:21:02.300]  We're being demonized.
[03:21:02.300 --> 03:21:08.260]  Yeah, I mean, and that's the most ammunition they have is to just wave these kids, to bring
[03:21:08.260 --> 03:21:11.340]  the kids on stage and, hey kids, what do you think about gun laws?
[03:21:11.340 --> 03:21:15.640]  I would really like Obama to ask, hey kids, what do you think about these drones killing
[03:21:15.640 --> 03:21:17.820]  other kids in the other parts of the world?
[03:21:17.820 --> 03:21:19.620]  I really wish you'd asked those kids that.
[03:21:19.620 --> 03:21:23.580]  Well, what Ron was saying about the UN arms trade treaty is exactly right.
[03:21:23.580 --> 03:21:27.860]  I think that this has been the target all along is registration.
[03:21:27.860 --> 03:21:31.800]  They talked about confiscation, and Feinstein is a master of misdirection.
[03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:33.060]  She did that with the NDAA.
[03:21:33.060 --> 03:21:37.260]  She told people that she came up with a Feinstein-Lee amendment that said, we're going to take out
[03:21:37.260 --> 03:21:41.740]  the bad sections of the NDAA that violate civil liberties and deny due process and turn
[03:21:41.740 --> 03:21:44.380]  this into a military court instead of a civilian court.
[03:21:44.380 --> 03:21:46.820]  And then they just removed it arbitrarily, McCain-
[03:21:46.820 --> 03:21:49.540]  Or then they come back and go, this is the new NDAA.
[03:21:49.540 --> 03:21:50.540]  We're going to restrict it.
[03:21:50.540 --> 03:21:51.980]  And then it gets rid of Posse Comitatus.
[03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:52.980]  Right.
[03:21:52.980 --> 03:21:53.980]  So she's been involved in this kind of mystery.
[03:21:53.980 --> 03:21:56.740]  Let me treat that bullet word, boom, boom, boom.
[03:21:56.740 --> 03:22:00.200]  She's been involved in this kind of misdirection before, and this is about registration.
[03:22:00.200 --> 03:22:04.560]  This arms trade treaty focuses on the transfer of weapons across borders.
[03:22:04.560 --> 03:22:09.260]  And they said, the only way that we can do that is if we identify and register guns and
[03:22:09.260 --> 03:22:10.260]  gun owners.
[03:22:10.260 --> 03:22:11.260]  That's right.
[03:22:11.260 --> 03:22:13.100]  The states have to agree to control the guns within their borders.
[03:22:13.100 --> 03:22:18.420]  So just like Agenda 21, the UN comes up and they have this other, I can't remember right
[03:22:18.420 --> 03:22:19.420]  off the top of my head.
[03:22:19.420 --> 03:22:20.420]  Legal framework.
[03:22:20.420 --> 03:22:21.420]  Yeah.
[03:22:21.420 --> 03:22:22.420]  They create these legal frameworks.
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:23.420]  UNIDIR.
[03:22:23.420 --> 03:22:24.420]  Yeah.
[03:22:24.420 --> 03:22:25.420]  Just like they do with Agenda 21.
[03:22:25.420 --> 03:22:26.900]  And then they have the individual countries enact this.
[03:22:26.900 --> 03:22:28.700]  So they're coming at it from both directions.
[03:22:28.700 --> 03:22:32.440]  They're coming at it with domestic legislation and they're coming at it with the treaty.
[03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:35.260]  Because they're not going to take a chance that they're going to lose on this registration.
[03:22:35.260 --> 03:22:39.220]  And if we say that we won because we beat them back from confiscation and all we got
[03:22:39.220 --> 03:22:41.580]  was registration, that was what they were after all.
[03:22:41.580 --> 03:22:42.580]  Absolutely.
[03:22:42.580 --> 03:22:43.580]  And again, it's two sided.
[03:22:43.580 --> 03:22:48.220]  They're not only trying to get us registered for confiscation, a bunch of states already
[03:22:48.220 --> 03:22:50.980]  taking them, and home inspections and all this.
[03:22:50.980 --> 03:22:54.740]  Internationally, it's about not letting little countries get arms to protect themselves from
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:55.740]  the UN death force.
[03:22:55.740 --> 03:22:56.740]  Right.
[03:22:56.740 --> 03:23:01.020]  And folks don't know the UN is the greatest mass murderers over time the world's ever
[03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:02.020]  seen.
[03:23:02.020 --> 03:23:04.020]  Mao has the highest number than Stalin and then Hitler.
[03:23:04.020 --> 03:23:06.700]  Well, I should go Stalin, Lenin, Hitler.
[03:23:06.700 --> 03:23:13.980]  But the UN continually just is murdering, slaughtering, raping, lining people up, shooting
[03:23:13.980 --> 03:23:14.980]  them.
[03:23:14.980 --> 03:23:16.820]  But Angelina Jolie says they love your kids.
[03:23:16.820 --> 03:23:17.820]  Let's go to a phone call.
[03:23:17.820 --> 03:23:19.820]  Paul in New Jersey.
[03:23:19.820 --> 03:23:20.820]  You're on the air, Paul.
[03:23:20.820 --> 03:23:21.820]  Welcome.
[03:23:21.820 --> 03:23:22.820]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:23:22.820 --> 03:23:23.820]  Yeah.
[03:23:23.820 --> 03:23:24.820]  Well, you're talking about Fast and Furious.
[03:23:24.820 --> 03:23:32.060]  Well, that's the guns for the drug dealers, the hard drug dealers.
[03:23:32.060 --> 03:23:35.980]  They give them, that's their supplier, they give them the guns and they shoot the people
[03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:37.460]  who are trying to stop them down there.
[03:23:37.460 --> 03:23:41.580]  That's when they shot the 200 Mexicans and in another war, INSA used.
[03:23:41.580 --> 03:23:46.100]  Well, I mean, it's actually in the thousands, they conservatively 400.
[03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:50.020]  It's thousands and thousands of dead Mexicans with the Fast and Furious stuff.
[03:23:50.020 --> 03:23:53.540]  Hundreds here, at least three cops, Border Patrol and a cop.
[03:23:53.540 --> 03:23:54.900]  You're absolutely right.
[03:23:54.900 --> 03:23:58.720]  Imagine, it's not about Fast and Furious anymore and all those dead kids.
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:02.980]  It's about how we, Obama actually and Holder and the rest of them shipped the guns down
[03:24:02.980 --> 03:24:04.880]  there to blame the Second Amendment.
[03:24:04.880 --> 03:24:10.060]  And now they flipped it around and gone, you know, the Congress won't even have a vote.
[03:24:10.060 --> 03:24:12.500]  Why are you doing that to the family?
[03:24:12.500 --> 03:24:13.500]  And it's so transparent.
[03:24:13.500 --> 03:24:19.740]  I mean, I watch the public and they are just so timid and weak.
[03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:22.700]  I even see like big tough guys, you know, I'll sit there and watch people in public
[03:24:22.700 --> 03:24:24.180]  and they're even insecure.
[03:24:24.180 --> 03:24:25.180]  People think about them.
[03:24:25.180 --> 03:24:27.860]  I mean, you guys aren't like that, I guess, because you're in the media and have gotten
[03:24:27.860 --> 03:24:28.860]  over it or whatever.
[03:24:28.860 --> 03:24:29.860]  I guess I got over it.
[03:24:29.860 --> 03:24:31.180]  But it's just everybody's so pathetic.
[03:24:31.180 --> 03:24:36.020]  I mean, it's like, it's so obvious, a bunch of slime is using these dead kids and probably
[03:24:36.020 --> 03:24:37.020]  ran the whole thing.
[03:24:37.020 --> 03:24:39.820]  And the magnitude of the people that have died and these other issues like you're talking
[03:24:39.820 --> 03:24:42.740]  about the Fast and Furious and other places, even Obama's drone strikes.
[03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:47.200]  I mean, we point out the hypocrisy of all of this to, yes, it's terrible that these
[03:24:47.200 --> 03:24:48.580]  children have died.
[03:24:48.580 --> 03:24:54.400]  But to take these 20 children, why are their lives so much more special that we talk about
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:58.860]  that for months and months and months and overturn our Constitution and ignore these
[03:24:58.860 --> 03:25:02.100]  other children who have died orders of magnitude.
[03:25:02.100 --> 03:25:05.260]  It's a giant psych warfare operation and it's backfiring.
[03:25:05.260 --> 03:25:09.140]  I can look at it politically, but also in my gut tell they're freaked out and they're
[03:25:09.140 --> 03:25:10.580]  going to do some more shootings.
[03:25:10.580 --> 03:25:12.660]  That's the big problem.
[03:25:12.660 --> 03:25:16.260]  They could stage one any day now and they've got all sorts of mental patients wound up
[03:25:16.260 --> 03:25:18.500]  right now with the guns trying to get them to go into school.
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:23.620]  And they keep saying the kids, the kids, and remember last year the big Kony 2012 deal,
[03:25:23.620 --> 03:25:27.980]  we got to go in Africa and save the kids from this guy who's probably been dead for ten
[03:25:27.980 --> 03:25:28.980]  plus years.
[03:25:28.980 --> 03:25:29.980]  Now hadn't been seen for seven, yeah.
[03:25:29.980 --> 03:25:33.920]  Yeah, and then I think it was last week, the week before, they had the kids for the Free
[03:25:33.920 --> 03:25:38.860]  Syrian Army running around with the AK-47 throwing dynamite around and nobody seemed
[03:25:38.860 --> 03:25:39.860]  to care about that.
[03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:44.420]  No, no, it's like they're trying to give everybody multiple personalities.
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:49.740]  You have a personality that cares about violence and bad things, but they trigger it when they
[03:25:49.740 --> 03:25:50.740]  want.
[03:25:50.740 --> 03:25:52.860]  But then your other personality laughs at it.
[03:25:52.860 --> 03:25:56.700]  It's like, hey, we killed a million Iraqis over the last 15 years, it's terrible.
[03:25:56.700 --> 03:25:57.900]  I'm like, shut up, traitor.
[03:25:57.900 --> 03:26:03.020]  Well, you know, part of it might be that if you kill 500,000 kids in Iraq with your sanctions
[03:26:03.020 --> 03:26:06.800]  and you say it's worth it like Madeleine Albright did, people can't get their head around that.
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:11.040]  But if you get them 26 kids and you show the parents and you show the faces and you do
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:13.780]  it over and over and over again, now that's a tragedy.
[03:26:13.780 --> 03:26:17.900]  You made me just think you ought to do a stand up deal for the news tonight where you point
[03:26:17.900 --> 03:26:23.900]  out her, who was it, on NBC going, I think it was worth it for 500,000 dead kids.
[03:26:23.900 --> 03:26:26.180]  And she's admired.
[03:26:26.180 --> 03:26:29.900]  When Brzezinski Brzezinski goes up on stage, he's a rock star because he's killed so many
[03:26:29.900 --> 03:26:30.900]  people.
[03:26:30.900 --> 03:26:33.620]  But what they admire is he did it by funding other groups.
[03:26:33.620 --> 03:26:40.980]  He brags in his books, I couldn't kill 30% of the Cambodians, but I funded the groups
[03:26:40.980 --> 03:26:41.980]  to get it done.
[03:26:41.980 --> 03:26:43.380]  And they're like, oh, that's really slick.
[03:26:43.380 --> 03:26:49.420]  Cuz to them it's like English in pool or something, it's like, ooh, and they admire, oh, you're
[03:26:49.420 --> 03:26:50.420]  so manly.
[03:26:50.420 --> 03:26:52.860]  It's like Richard Pearl, known as the Prince of Darkness one time, it was in the New York
[03:26:52.860 --> 03:26:53.860]  Times.
[03:26:53.860 --> 03:26:54.860]  But they were saying how cool it was.
[03:26:54.860 --> 03:26:58.500]  He walked up to a bunch of women, good looking women at a party, and the guy weighs like
[03:26:58.500 --> 03:27:01.860]  400 pounds, giant black circles around his eyes, I mean, I do too.
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:06.100]  But the point is, he walks up and goes, I order strikes, I kill people.
[03:27:06.100 --> 03:27:09.980]  And even these evil women swans into an order were turned off by the fact, it's not cool
[03:27:09.980 --> 03:27:12.040]  to go, I kill people.
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:15.380]  And that guy couldn't kill anybody with his bare hands if his life depended on it.
[03:27:15.380 --> 03:27:19.820]  I mean, it's just a big fat wimp thinking killing people's cool.
[03:27:19.820 --> 03:27:23.980]  And then we got his Republican counterpart, Kissinger, right?
[03:27:23.980 --> 03:27:25.820]  The counterpart to Brzezinski.
[03:27:25.820 --> 03:27:30.580]  And WikiLeaks had a document leaked this week that said, the illegal we do immediately,
[03:27:30.580 --> 03:27:32.380]  the unconstitutional takes a little longer.
[03:27:32.380 --> 03:27:33.940]  That's why they're dragging this thing out.
[03:27:33.940 --> 03:27:36.440]  They know it's unconstitutional, and it is, it's registered.
[03:27:36.440 --> 03:27:39.380]  And plus, when they change the original laws, it wrecks societies.
[03:27:39.380 --> 03:27:43.540]  I mean, we're gonna become like Mexico or North Korea very quickly.
[03:27:43.540 --> 03:27:45.460]  They get rid of this, nothing's gonna work anymore.
[03:27:45.460 --> 03:27:48.300]  Yeah, I don't think they realize that, though.
[03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:52.780]  I mean, you got so many people there, they're going off emotion instead of common sense.
[03:27:52.780 --> 03:27:55.420]  Well, sure, the grassroots morons don't, but the technocrats do.
[03:27:55.420 --> 03:27:57.860]  They're all getting offshore islands with private security details.
[03:27:57.860 --> 03:28:01.700]  I mean, this is how you destroy civilization.
[03:28:01.700 --> 03:28:03.780]  Tyrants destroy civilization.
[03:28:03.780 --> 03:28:06.460]  Rome fell from within.
[03:28:06.460 --> 03:28:10.140]  And it's just they have no vision, even if, and these people are out of control.
[03:28:10.140 --> 03:28:13.780]  Alex in Illinois, last caller we have, Tom Ford, apologize to the loaded phones.
[03:28:13.780 --> 03:28:16.380]  Alex, you're on the air, take us out.
[03:28:16.380 --> 03:28:17.380]  You can hear me?
[03:28:17.380 --> 03:28:18.380]  Yes, sir.
[03:28:18.380 --> 03:28:22.420]  Okay, hello, Mr. Jones and friends, this is Alex from Shirec.
[03:28:22.420 --> 03:28:26.380]  Transform and roll out, sorry.
[03:28:26.380 --> 03:28:30.780]  I spoke to you regarding the bottom of the rabbit hole, and you gave a very eloquent,
[03:28:30.780 --> 03:28:31.780]  passionate response.
[03:28:31.780 --> 03:28:32.780]  Yeah, that's on Prison Planet.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:33.780]  You don't see it again.
[03:28:33.780 --> 03:28:38.880]  Yeah, I saw that under the ranch, but I think the rabbit hole is akin to the abyss.
[03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:43.260]  When you look at the bottom of the abyss or the rabbit hole, you see yourself reflected.
[03:28:43.260 --> 03:28:49.260]  And with the modernized genocide of the individual and the motives behind these banksters and
[03:28:49.260 --> 03:28:54.860]  New World Order members, I think we must look to the problems within to solve the problems
[03:28:54.860 --> 03:28:55.860]  outside.
[03:28:55.860 --> 03:28:57.700]  Primarily, when is enough enough?
[03:28:57.700 --> 03:28:59.860]  Is it ever going to be enough?
[03:28:59.860 --> 03:29:03.980]  And what sins of human beings are causing this rot in the apple?
[03:29:03.980 --> 03:29:05.860]  You're a great caller.
[03:29:05.860 --> 03:29:09.560]  Listen to this, stand your ground, don't fire unless fired upon.
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:12.420]  But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.
[03:29:12.420 --> 03:29:18.540]  And that was the militia captain, John Parker at Lexington Green on April 19th, 1776.
[03:29:18.540 --> 03:29:19.540]  Was it 1775?
[03:29:19.540 --> 03:29:23.940]  The point is, I'm going from memory there, cuz I can't see the quote up on Infowars.com.
[03:29:23.940 --> 03:29:28.080]  We have that front page image of the Oathkeeper, they were trying to block his sign.
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:32.240]  And there he is, and that's why they were so freaked out by it.
[03:29:32.240 --> 03:29:34.560]  Stand your ground, don't fire unless fired upon.
[03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:37.700]  But they're already firing in our water, our vaccines, our food.
[03:29:37.700 --> 03:29:40.340]  The war has already begun, to quote Patrick Henry.
[03:29:40.340 --> 03:29:43.500]  It's an Infowar, they want to make it physical cuz they're losing this one.
[03:29:43.500 --> 03:29:47.500]  Join us tonight, 7 o'clock Central, get your friends and family to watch 7 o'clock Central
[03:29:47.500 --> 03:29:59.180]  Infowars Nightly News.
