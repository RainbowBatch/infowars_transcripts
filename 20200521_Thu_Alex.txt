[00:00.000 --> 00:21.520]  Right, Alex Jones is funny than Andy Kaufman's ever been.
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.720]  Alex Jones is f***ing hilarious, often.
[00:23.720 --> 00:26.440]  Did you see the whole Bill Hicks, that he's Bill Hicks?
[00:26.440 --> 00:27.440]  Yeah, no.
[00:27.440 --> 00:28.440]  Tensperacy?
[00:28.440 --> 00:29.440]  That's not real.
[00:29.440 --> 00:32.920]  I know, but there are videos.
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.840]  But he had one thing we're talking about, like if it's between his family starving
[00:37.840 --> 00:38.840]  or eating his neighbor.
[00:38.840 --> 00:39.840]  I know.
[00:39.840 --> 00:40.840]  He's like, I'll eat your ass.
[00:40.840 --> 00:41.840]  I thought.
[00:41.840 --> 00:42.840]  So he became this, come on.
[00:42.840 --> 00:46.480]  Do you don't think there's an entertainment value in him saying he's going to eat his
[00:46.480 --> 00:47.480]  neighbor?
[00:47.480 --> 00:48.480]  I'm on my doctor fire.
[00:48.480 --> 00:49.480]  Right.
[00:49.480 --> 00:57.280]  But there's something to that, like to stop that and ban that, you're not stopping
[00:57.280 --> 01:06.880]  anyone from, you're not stopping anybody from anything bad by not having Alex do this entertaining
[01:06.880 --> 01:08.160]  thing about eating his neighbor.
[01:08.160 --> 01:09.160]  You're not saving anybody.
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.160]  Yeah.
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.160]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:11.160 --> 01:14.000]  Like you gotta, you gotta, like what are you doing?
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.360]  Like, what is he doing that's so awful?
[01:16.360 --> 01:18.960]  I don't know how to fix any of it.
[01:18.960 --> 01:19.960]  It's entertaining.
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.960]  Like, why is it only acceptable if you have some kind of entertainment?
[01:23.960 --> 01:28.600]  Because there's so many rap videos that you could watch that I enjoy, but they're talking
[01:28.600 --> 01:33.960]  about shooting people and robbing people and it's everywhere on YouTube.
[01:33.960 --> 01:34.960]  It's so prevalent.
[01:34.960 --> 01:35.960]  Yeah.
[01:35.960 --> 01:36.960]  And somehow or other that's okay.
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.960]  Like it's f***ing weird what's allowed and what's not allowed.
[01:42.960 --> 01:46.120]  All right.
[01:46.120 --> 01:50.640]  As any regular listener or viewer knows, I could care less about Hollywood.
[01:50.640 --> 01:51.640]  In fact, I hate it.
[01:51.640 --> 01:56.360]  I could care less about a hundred million dollar deals and care less about Spotify stock
[01:56.360 --> 01:59.720]  being up four million dollars if it was just in the normal course of business.
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.560]  But with all the huge news we've got and the fact that I'm supposed to be taken off the
[02:04.560 --> 02:10.240]  show to work on the Bill Gates documentary and take the kids hiking, I'm here at work.
[02:10.240 --> 02:13.560]  I'm on air because of this.
[02:13.560 --> 02:20.520]  Joe called me yesterday and we talked about 45 minutes and I've known him 22 years and
[02:20.520 --> 02:23.600]  he has never spilled his guts to me like he did.
[02:23.600 --> 02:27.880]  And I mean, there's been times when we both had like two bottles of liquor and been up
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.720]  for a day and a half in Vegas and we didn't spill guts like this.
[02:32.720 --> 02:40.000]  So this was over the top and the planet's all aligned and he told me three months ago
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.800]  about the deal, but asked me not to talk about it till it was done.
[02:43.800 --> 02:46.880]  And I said, Hey, I mean, it's great what you're doing.
[02:46.880 --> 02:54.160]  But then when he saw them ban all these medical doctors, prestigious doctors, hospital owners,
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.800]  Cedar Sinai clinic owners that were coming out and exposed to the COVID fraud and he
[02:58.800 --> 03:04.080]  saw the media put out the lies of Bill and Bill Gates and all the fake models and then
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.840]  he saw people he knew demonetized, banned, blocked for having those doctors on.
[03:10.840 --> 03:14.480]  He said that's it because he wasn't ready to do the deal.
[03:14.480 --> 03:19.080]  He wasn't sure about it and he was on the razor's edge and then he did that.
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.080]  Now, why is that so important?
[03:20.080 --> 03:23.000]  This is bigger than Joe Rogan, the number one podcast in the world.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  It's about free expression and it's about the dominoes falling and it's about the fact
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.480]  that Dave Rubin, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, they're all moving to Austin and they're classical
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.680]  liberals not leftist authoritarians and they're trying to escape the left.
[03:38.680 --> 03:43.360]  And with thought leaders like that, we could get the left to finally wake up to a great
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.560]  extent about what schmucks they are.
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.120]  And so a revolution against the globalist from the leftist movement and by liberals
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.520]  is victory.
[03:55.520 --> 03:59.320]  So folks, you know you get next year's news today here, okay?
[03:59.320 --> 04:01.280]  I knew Trump was going to win.
[04:01.280 --> 04:03.120]  It was big when we had Trump on.
[04:03.120 --> 04:04.760]  I wasn't nervous at all.
[04:04.760 --> 04:06.320]  Not nervous when I talk to Trump on the phone.
[04:06.320 --> 04:07.320]  It's important.
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.520]  Trump's important.
[04:08.520 --> 04:14.880]  This Joe Rogan thing is way bigger when I look at the tea leaves and the psychic imprint
[04:14.880 --> 04:20.280]  you could say makes me have not chills up the back, chills in my third eye.
[04:20.280 --> 04:22.600]  I mean, I'm having chills right here right now.
[04:22.600 --> 04:24.560]  I've never had that before.
[04:24.560 --> 04:26.840]  This is a tremor in the force.
[04:26.840 --> 04:30.120]  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.880]  This is a big enchilada.
[04:33.880 --> 04:37.520]  And I said, Joe, you sure you want me to go on there and say all this because he's,
[04:37.520 --> 04:40.400]  I'm getting the big story because I'm in the story.
[04:40.400 --> 04:42.360]  And this is a story about all of us.
[04:42.360 --> 04:43.360]  We come back.
[04:43.360 --> 04:45.000]  We've got so much big news today.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.240]  But believe me, you do not want to miss this transmission info wars.com tomorrow's news
[04:50.240 --> 04:53.200]  today for the pro human future.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.400]  Joe is defecting to the new info war.
[04:56.400 --> 04:58.600]  That's right.
[04:58.600 --> 05:04.760]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020 and within a week or so, many of the best selling
[05:04.760 --> 05:08.800]  items that we're selling at info wars.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[05:08.800 --> 05:13.160]  In fact, last year I said I can't get 50% off anymore because our markup isn't enough
[05:13.160 --> 05:16.520]  for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[05:16.520 --> 05:19.400]  But I want you to get the ultimate crude oil.
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.400]  I want you to get Vaso beats.
[05:21.400 --> 05:23.560]  I want you to get DNA force plus.
[05:23.560 --> 05:26.120]  I want you to experience X2.
[05:26.120 --> 05:29.040]  I want you to get real red pill and real red pill plus.
[05:29.040 --> 05:34.320]  They're all in stock right now and they're 30 to 60% off.
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.520]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.160]  most items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close to selling
[05:43.160 --> 05:46.480]  out like real red pill, real red pill plus and Vaso beats.
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.800]  So take action, be healthier, boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the info war in
