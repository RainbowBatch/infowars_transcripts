[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:10.200]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Sof, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:10.200 --> 00:28.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:28.040 --> 00:34.720]  It is Thursday, October 10th, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34.720 --> 00:42.240]  Now, I'm going to be co-hosting with Will Johnson tonight from 7 past 9 o'clock during
[00:42.240 --> 00:52.000]  Firepower at mfoldwars.com for its last show, covering the live Minneapolis, Minnesota rally
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.040]  that Trump is going to be holding. I'll talk more about that in a moment.
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.360]  As you know, the mayor is trying to keep the president from being able to speak, and that
[01:00.360 --> 01:04.040]  ties into a key point we'll hit in a second.
[01:04.040 --> 01:11.040]  First off, the corporate media is very breathless. CBS News last night ran a story saying,
[01:11.040 --> 01:18.200]  read the second complaint of the second whistleblower. And when I read it, the story is that it's
[01:18.200 --> 01:25.440]  not a story. It's just stunning how they recycle the same thin air as if it's a giant
[01:25.440 --> 01:31.760]  porterhouse steak perfectly cooked on your plate with a side of mashed potatoes and carrots.
[01:31.760 --> 01:39.400]  It is a complete mirage. It simply says, oh, that the person had knowledge of someone who
[01:39.400 --> 01:42.760]  simply was listening to, again, the same phone call.
[01:42.760 --> 01:48.520]  So more hearsay off of the hearsay when we have the transcript of what the president
[01:48.520 --> 01:53.240]  said. They're also hoaxing saying that Mike Pence was involved in bad stuff. He's tried
[01:53.240 --> 01:58.840]  to release his transcript. But here's why this fraud is still successful. It still makes
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.280]  the Republicans get on the defensive and start responding to the Democrats like they're the
[02:03.280 --> 02:09.080]  authority, like they're the boss up on high as they fire up this fake impeachment inquiry.
[02:09.080 --> 02:13.040]  And again, the impeachment's real. They're moving forward, but it's not even through
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.920]  the lawful procedures. It's done through an exploratory committee of an impeachment inquiry,
[02:18.920 --> 02:25.040]  so they don't have to do the investigation with due process. Again, unprecedented criminal
[02:25.040 --> 02:32.880]  activity. They've made a conscious decision to engage in classical fraud, classical criminal
[02:32.880 --> 02:35.960]  activities at every level.
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.200]  Now let's shift gears into why I'm getting into Minnesota and the Trump Prodigy Night
[02:40.200 --> 02:48.960]  being so important. There are articles out every single day. So many reports that I really
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.960]  have gotten to a shell shocked point and hardly ever cover it, where major universities in
[02:53.960 --> 03:00.880]  Europe, in England, in Canada, and in the U.S., and as far away as Australia, this is
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.640]  all a globalized standard system, are telling white students that they have to go to mandatory
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.560]  classes and mandatory film screenings to learn how white people are inherently evil and how
[03:12.560 --> 03:20.000]  basically all sex is rape and just incredibly divisive systems. And I've seen three articles
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.720]  just this week from England and the U.S., where major universities are having anti-racism
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.400]  events, but then saying that white people can't come to those. Paul Watson has an article
[03:33.400 --> 03:40.080]  today about Sheffield England, actually where he's from, and the college there locally engaging
[03:40.080 --> 03:45.760]  in this. They say it's not enough to be anti-racism. You've got to be, you know, quote, actively
[03:45.760 --> 03:52.760]  out there engaging all forms of it. Well, that means whiteness, America, the West, culture,
[03:52.760 --> 03:57.800]  any of that is evil, any of that is bad. Take Sweden. They've announced they're going to
[03:57.800 --> 04:05.760]  ban all teaching in colleges and in primary school of Swedish culture and their history
[04:05.760 --> 04:14.280]  because Sweden itself existing and once being a homogeneous Viking culture is evil. So again,
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.480]  this is a global corporate system to erase any identity in the West so that the new technocracy
[04:19.480 --> 04:24.920]  backed up by the chai comms can take over. And that ties into the mayor of Minneapolis
[04:24.920 --> 04:30.800]  saying Trump is a white supremacist. He shouldn't be allowed to come into Minnesota or Minneapolis.
[04:30.800 --> 04:36.320]  Again, it's all about barring people's speech, barring their action, using a global social
[04:36.320 --> 04:40.680]  credit score to totally control people. And that's why this is so dangerous. They're
[04:40.680 --> 04:45.080]  consciously doing this and they're training our children and others that they have no
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.800]  rights and we can laugh this as adults. But in just another generation, this will be in
[04:49.800 --> 04:55.400]  place if we do not stand up and say no to all of it. Tom Papert's coming up. Huge breaking
[04:55.400 --> 05:09.400]  news at infowars.com.
[05:09.400 --> 05:14.280]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[05:14.280 --> 05:20.160]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years. And now they
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.560]  own our debt. Now they own the Democratic Party. Now they've merged Silicon Valley to
[05:24.560 --> 05:30.240]  censor patriots off the air. Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi Ping,
[05:30.240 --> 05:36.800]  the dictator of China will quote destroy Trump. That's a headline. So infowars has been the
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.640]  Paul Revere of this operation. We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven
[05:41.640 --> 05:46.160]  right. And that's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.440]  their Chai Kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about info wars and check
[05:50.440 --> 05:55.920]  out infowarstore.com. That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded. That's where
[05:55.920 --> 06:06.920]  the tip of the spear is continually being forged is infowarstore.com.
