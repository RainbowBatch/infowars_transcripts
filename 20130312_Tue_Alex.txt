[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.360]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.360 --> 00:38.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 12th day of March, 2013, and I am going to cover
[00:38.480 --> 00:44.760]  all this news today. We have a famous lawyer joining us on the broadcast who has beaten
[00:44.760 --> 00:51.720]  the Food and Drug Administration trying to ban vitamins and minerals seven times. And
[00:51.720 --> 00:58.880]  he's more responsible than anybody else out there with allowing food freedom, what's left
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.200]  of it in this country.
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.600]  Jonathan W. Emord will be joining us in the third hour. Now, you know Professor Griff
[01:07.600 --> 01:12.480]  is in the Obama deception, one of the more famous individuals in hip-hop out there and
[01:12.480 --> 01:16.720]  one of the founders of Public Enemy. And I know that he's an off and on listener, cuz
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.600]  I've heard shows where he's talked about the broadcast. He's plugged the Obama deception
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.200]  in some of his big concerts, cuz I've seen it in the LA Times.
[01:24.200 --> 01:30.640]  And we're talking to one of his managers, cohorts, friends, and reportedly he's on at
[01:30.640 --> 01:34.880]  noon today. But we haven't been in contact with him in a few days, and they're on tour
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.360]  and there's much stuff going on. So we'll see if that happens in the second hour today.
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.960]  Professor Griff, 90% coming on the show. I mean, it's pretty much 100%, but I don't like
[01:44.960 --> 01:46.360]  saying that when you've been out of contact.
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.720]  Plus, I've noticed with entertainment people, whether it's Willie Nelson or whether it's
[01:51.720 --> 02:02.760]  people like Professor Griff or KRS-One, or even getting a few weeks ago, a mortal technique
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.000]  in here. He was supposed to be on the Wednesday, and then they got caught up in another city,
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.680]  I think it was Houston. And so he was on Thursday, he was on another day late.
[02:14.680 --> 02:17.960]  He wasn't on the radio, he was on the Nightly News. So I've just learned about half the
[02:17.960 --> 02:24.640]  time with music people, it doesn't happen. But it's no big deal, we'll see what happens.
[02:24.640 --> 02:28.280]  I'm kind of excited about the interview, cuz he's all about exposing the Illuminati and
[02:28.280 --> 02:33.800]  the rest of it, and really has some interesting perspectives on it, and where the whole world's
[02:33.800 --> 02:34.800]  going.
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.080]  So regardless, we're very close to landing Professor Griff here on the broadcast. And
[02:38.080 --> 02:44.880]  again, it's not a celebrity hunt on the show, I wanna get interesting celebrities on, and
[02:44.880 --> 02:49.520]  interesting people. I mean, I found out about this lawyer, I was like, we talked about the
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.960]  lawyer that Jevity hired back in the 90s and in the 2000s.
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.840]  And then Ron Paul's talked about the guy, he's a big guest on Coast to Coast AM. I said,
[02:58.840 --> 03:05.000]  why don't we get the lawyer who keeps beating the FDA trying to ban vitamins and minerals
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.640]  on? To me, that's a really interesting person. The head of the Small Business League that's
[03:11.640 --> 03:15.200]  trying to keep a few jobs in this country, that's an important person to have on.
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.120]  I'd say it's pretty much whatever I think's important. And a lot of times also what you
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.600]  end up recommending, a lot of the guests you recommend. In fact, we should add an email
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.320]  that goes into the producer's inbox. I know Coast to Coast does this. I mentioned it this
[03:31.320 --> 03:40.000]  years ago, guest at infoawars.com, where you can just email us, can we create that email
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  right now?
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.400]  I'll just ask the IT guys, guest, and then assign it to all your emails, guys, all four
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.000]  of you. And then because I mean, it's a lot of great ideas, and then you can run those
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.520]  past me, who listeners wanna hear on the broadcast. Now, all of that said, this is another one
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.400]  of those days, it's like deja vu, but it's like Groundhog Day, but worse because things
[04:02.400 --> 04:04.440]  are more intense every day.
[04:04.440 --> 04:10.080]  I came in here this morning, and of course last night doing research, and I looked at
[04:10.080 --> 04:18.840]  this news. And it's so crazy, and it's so over the top, and it's so out of control,
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.960]  and I can see exactly what the power structure is doing. I mean, these are the type of crazy
[04:24.960 --> 04:26.960]  things I've got here in front of me.
[04:26.960 --> 04:33.880]  Massive mosquitoes, 20 times normal size, genetically modified, coming to the US, prisonplanet.com.
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.640]  Here's another one, Sky News, that's Fox of the UK. Cinema shooting, judge approves truth
[04:39.640 --> 04:44.920]  serum. They're gonna drug people now. Because when you're under mind control, they put you
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.920]  on those truth serum drugs, it puts you back under the mind control. This guy was under
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.040]  government psychiatric care. I mean, there's the public mind control right there. That's
[04:53.040 --> 05:01.280]  just some of what's coming up. It's all insane in the membrane.
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.280]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[05:05.280 --> 05:10.360]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[05:10.360 --> 05:15.520]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[08:53.400 --> 08:59.360]  the tip of the spear in a desperate attempt to awaken the spirit of liberty, the spirit
[08:59.360 --> 09:13.320]  of 1776 worldwide. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[09:13.320 --> 09:20.840]  Nobody rides for free. Monday through Friday, thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:20.840 --> 09:28.340]  All right, where should I start here today? I tried every day, I fail every day. But we're
[09:28.340 --> 09:36.840]  gonna try to just, just let me not even start with the top stories. Here's one, City Billboard
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.360]  urges Hispanics to revolt in Austin, Texas.
[09:40.360 --> 09:49.740]  It shows a mass of people with black flags running across the Texas-US border saying
[09:49.740 --> 09:59.560]  arriba me gente or basically uprise or rise or revolt my people. And of course, it's paid
[09:59.560 --> 10:06.880]  for by taxpayer money. And they have billboards paid for by Spanish speaking companies, white
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.580]  guys, I've noticed that own them and run them, saying la reconquista or the reconquering
[10:12.580 --> 10:21.040]  or the la infasura, the invasion.
[10:21.040 --> 10:27.760]  And it's all racist. It's all whites are evil, whites are the devil, blacks are evil, blacks
[10:27.760 --> 10:33.960]  are the devil, that's part of it. And I sit here and I'm somebody who's gone out and I
[10:33.960 --> 10:42.120]  don't say this to like, I'm a good white person, I have guilt, I like you, be my friend. It's
[10:42.120 --> 10:44.440]  all mind control.
[10:44.440 --> 10:49.400]  The globalists are running this. I want you to have success no matter what color you are.
[10:49.400 --> 10:55.680]  I want your progeny to touch the stars. I know what comes around goes around. I'm into
[10:55.680 --> 11:03.080]  the spirit and we've all got one. I'm looking way past the color of your skin, but we're
[11:03.080 --> 11:05.240]  forced into this.
[11:05.240 --> 11:11.320]  And it's a forced collision to make, you see the left isn't actually trying to create unity.
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.420]  They're actually trying to create division. And I'm gonna be breaking this down at the
[11:15.420 --> 11:19.840]  bottom of the hour. I'm gonna stop right there, a special report at the bottom of the hour.
[11:19.840 --> 11:22.760]  I'm gonna get into this.
[11:22.760 --> 11:27.120]  Because the Ford Foundation, the big banks, they have imploded Mexico and Latin America
[11:27.120 --> 11:35.380]  and they are going to now have Hispanics or try to force Hispanics to racially identify,
[11:35.380 --> 11:45.040]  to racially identify with socialism and communism in a race-based political system so that Hispanics
[11:45.040 --> 11:47.760]  cannot be reached with the message of liberty and freedom.
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.920]  And the globalists are gonna merge all of our countries in the North American Union
[11:50.920 --> 11:59.540]  and make us all slaves. And then the government will play the part of the arbiter of the referee
[11:59.540 --> 12:02.440]  over all this. So I'm gonna be breaking that down at the bottom of the hour. I'm gonna
[12:02.440 --> 12:08.720]  stop right there. And I'm gonna re-air a short film I did six years ago that's an extra on
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.520]  the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that never got the attention it deserved.
[12:13.520 --> 12:19.520]  And it is titled Battle for the Republic. It's 16 minutes long. And so I'm gonna break
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.720]  all this down at the bottom of the hour and then air that 16-minute film. We're gonna
[12:24.720 --> 12:26.680]  skip that network break at the end of the hour.
[12:26.680 --> 12:32.000]  I'm so out of control, folks. I don't plug my own sponsors. I refuse all this advertising
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.880]  money because I just will not even mention the stuff on air even though we need the money.
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.680]  I skip network breaks even though the network says please stop doing it. I just can't help
[12:40.680 --> 12:44.640]  it. You understand that's thousands of dollars every time I do that.
[12:44.640 --> 12:50.080]  Because I'm just so dedicated to covering info and I get so wound up. I'll just have
[12:50.080 --> 12:55.160]  the show go back to four or five hours. But then I get completely burned out and then
[12:55.160 --> 13:01.080]  can't, it's just it's insane. It's insane wanting to really free humanity and knowing
[13:01.080 --> 13:04.680]  all the globalist tricks and knowing I'm right.
[13:04.680 --> 13:11.080]  And knowing the globalist wheels behind wheels, plans within plans, knowing their playbook.
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.040]  And it's so frustrating. I just want the general public to have the playbook so you can be
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.920]  empowered. I want you to win. When you win, I win. We grow the pie. I love winners. I
[13:21.920 --> 13:28.340]  love success. I love everybody's children. I love innocence and everything good.
[13:28.340 --> 13:34.680]  And that's a weird thing nowadays. I don't get jealous by guys that have super gorgeous
[13:34.680 --> 13:39.320]  wives. I just sit there and admire them. I don't get jealous of men that are incredibly
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.040]  handsome. I just admire them. I don't get jealous of people that are incredible artists.
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.200]  I admire them. I don't get jealous of people who are successful that did it themselves.
[13:47.200 --> 13:53.360]  I admire them. And that's a rare thing now. This is a screwed up society, man. The globalist
[13:53.360 --> 14:01.560]  have really taught us how to fail. I admire amazing people. I want you to be amazing.
[14:01.560 --> 14:09.440]  But I'm not gonna sit here and watch the system brand selective. I mean, I was rereading,
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.160]  you know a judge ruled in California that kids will be sent home for wearing American
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.160]  flags?
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.480]  I have the newscast coming up. The American flag is now said to be evil. Now, of course,
[14:20.480 --> 14:24.280]  America's run by the globalist. So the flag does represent the new world order now because
[14:24.280 --> 14:28.080]  they've taken it, they've captured it. But the fact that at the same time the globalist
[14:28.080 --> 14:30.760]  use it to take over the world and take the blame for everything.
[14:30.760 --> 14:35.960]  And then they're demonizing it where you can't even wear it. Because the quote Hispanic kids
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.680]  say you can't and it's Hispanic kids mainly being sent home wearing American flag. They're
[14:39.680 --> 14:46.200]  going to force Hispanics to join the socialist globalist system to break up the US not to
[14:46.200 --> 14:54.080]  create some wonderful Mexican homeland. Mexico's imploded but to destroy all our countries.
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.300]  And it's so frustrating to know I'm 100% right because the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie
[14:58.300 --> 15:03.160]  Endowment are public about it. And to know that people are so confident in their race
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.680]  consciousness that it's gonna drive whites into their race consciousness group.
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.940]  It's gonna drive blacks into their race consciousness group, Hispanics, all of it. And then there
[15:12.940 --> 15:16.720]  won't be a unifying culture of the Bill of Rights, Constitution, private property, the
[15:16.720 --> 15:23.260]  family, freedom of religion, what really makes us successful. Let me tell you, I can look
[15:23.260 --> 15:31.520]  at all the angles. There's not a lot of good waters ahead. I hope we can make it through
[15:31.520 --> 15:32.520]  it.
[15:32.520 --> 15:41.400]  I hope people can get reality. But we are being converted through massive reeducation
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.080]  and through the prison system and through the schools. America is a giant prison now,
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.960]  biggest prison population in the world. And they segregate everybody into racial groups
[15:49.960 --> 15:55.420]  in the prison and then encourage the race gangs and the rest of it.
[15:55.420 --> 16:00.780]  And then to then feed that culture out on the public, MTV pushes it on record to break
[16:00.780 --> 16:09.760]  up and create division. While at the same time when the crisis erupts saying, give up
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.760]  all of your culture, white people, you're inherently bad and it's your fault all this
[16:13.760 --> 16:15.020]  is happening.
[16:15.020 --> 16:22.580]  While the social engineers are creating the entire witch's brew. And I guess I'm already
[16:22.580 --> 16:27.800]  getting into the subject. It just blows my mind that my taxpayer money in Austin's put
[16:27.800 --> 16:33.420]  up billboards saying, rise up Hispanics, rise up my people. And we've got a link to the
[16:33.420 --> 16:40.840]  video of the artist saying that that's basically, it's okay to be Mexican and it's okay to be
[16:40.840 --> 16:42.940]  for your people in Mexico.
[16:42.940 --> 16:48.780]  Mexico was just a Spanish colony. Mexico only had the United States for a few years of the
[16:48.780 --> 16:53.780]  Southwest. Wasn't long, the French had it too. The Russians had California or the Russians
[16:53.780 --> 17:00.160]  gonna, I mean, can the Spanish come back and take over Texas? It's all baloney. And America
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.940]  isn't perfect. But compared to the government culture in Mexico, it's light years better.
[17:04.940 --> 17:08.900]  And that's why the globalists want this and I'm already digressing. Let me just read to
[17:08.900 --> 17:11.460]  you the headlines as I said I would do.
[17:11.460 --> 17:22.140]  Okay, city billboard urges Hispanics to revolt. Can you imagine if the Austin city said, lights
[17:22.140 --> 17:28.820]  rise up. Can you imagine? I ought to try just to illustrate it, but the media would misrepresent
[17:28.820 --> 17:33.140]  it and say I was serious. I would try to go buy a billboard from Reagan, billboards, that's
[17:33.140 --> 17:34.140]  who this is.
[17:34.140 --> 17:38.940]  I bet this billboard probably cost $10,000 conservatively, just to paint it probably
[17:38.940 --> 17:43.300]  cost three or 4,000. So let's say $15,000 billboard, because I've looked into billboards
[17:43.300 --> 17:49.260]  I've paid for them before. $15,000 giant billboard on I-35 in Austin, hundreds of thousands of
[17:49.260 --> 17:50.860]  people a month will see it.
[17:50.860 --> 17:54.900]  And the great part about it is, Anglos and others who don't speak Spanish will never
[17:54.900 --> 17:58.980]  know. See, my wife grew up in Spain for like six years, so she speaks fluent Spanish. She's
[17:58.980 --> 18:03.940]  like, man, it says we're gonna conquer, we're gonna take over, gringos are the devil.
[18:03.940 --> 18:09.300]  She sees it everywhere, and she's like, man, this is wild. And I'm supposed to go, I am
[18:09.300 --> 18:14.220]  the devil. Thank you for having a, and again, they're gonna force all Hispanics into this
[18:14.220 --> 18:17.340]  as a political tool of control. In fact, I guess I'll just start covering this right
[18:17.340 --> 18:20.980]  now.
[18:20.980 --> 18:25.260]  That's the problem, this is one article out of over a hundred right here. Each one is
[18:25.260 --> 18:32.420]  just as important, each one. Massive mosquitoes, 20 time normal size coming to US genetically
[18:32.420 --> 18:38.220]  modified, prisonplanted.com, incredible. Here's another one, cinema shooting, judge approves
[18:38.220 --> 18:39.660]  truth serum.
[18:39.660 --> 18:43.700]  James Holmes could be subjected to truth serum should his lawyers enter an insanity plea
[18:43.700 --> 18:51.260]  at his pre-trial hearing this week. This is a new level of openly, hey, we'll have some
[18:51.260 --> 18:56.540]  checkpoints. Hey, well, this is mind control publicly. They use truth serum type drugs
[18:56.540 --> 19:01.060]  to put people into highly suggestible states, like Sirhan Sirhan, it came out, was drugged
[19:01.060 --> 19:02.060]  up with this.
[19:02.060 --> 19:08.420]  And that's the police reports in LA, the guy that shot RFK. Some of these other guys were
[19:08.420 --> 19:15.020]  on truth serum type drugs. And someone on mind control, you put them onto this to put
[19:15.020 --> 19:19.560]  them back in the trance. And this guy was on seven drugs, as we told you he would be,
[19:19.560 --> 19:23.340]  it came out a few months ago, seven drugs, the Colorado shooter reportedly.
[19:23.340 --> 19:27.360]  They reported other shooters, other smoke bombs, other, he told people in the jail who's
[19:27.360 --> 19:33.860]  coming off the drugs, I'm under control, I'm under mind control, they set me up. And that
[19:33.860 --> 19:40.340]  all came out. He had a top Air Force psych warfare chief over him. He was getting $37,000
[19:40.340 --> 19:47.060]  a year from DARPA. He was in a mind control program at the university with DARPA. So it's
[19:47.060 --> 19:51.340]  Theodore Kozinski, LA Times, look that up. The Unabomber was in MK Ultra. Don't believe
[19:51.340 --> 19:56.460]  me, just look it up. See, and now he's obviously not cooperating. So they're going to shoot
[19:56.460 --> 20:01.020]  him up again and publicly hide in plain view.
[20:01.020 --> 20:05.540]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[20:05.540 --> 20:10.620]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[20:10.620 --> 20:15.780]  are stockpiling food, gold and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[24:16.320 --> 24:25.520]  flames went higher and it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of fire you know
[24:25.520 --> 24:30.280]  the taste of love is sweet and hearts like ours mean all right let me just try to go
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.280]  over some more of the headlines here they're too insane so i told you this guy was under
[24:34.280 --> 24:39.220]  mind control it all came out in the news a piece here a piece there that was definitely
[24:39.220 --> 24:43.800]  a staged event and just like larry pratt said of gunners of america if they'd stage fast
[24:43.800 --> 24:48.880]  and furious that killed thousands they'd stage anything remember they staged oklahoma city
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.760]  the very same crew the same justice department crew here's bloomberg nice headline for you
[24:54.760 --> 25:01.640]  california seizes guns as owners lose right to bear arms they're now saying misdemeanors
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.280]  they're going to take your guns they're now saying if you ever went to a psychologist
[25:06.280 --> 25:12.840]  who said you had ptsd or depression boom the swat teams come take your guns it's all described
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.080]  and and and now they're going to take basically anybody with a misdemeanors gun all over the
[25:17.080 --> 25:22.520]  country they're coming they're coming for your guns uh colorado sheriffs senate dems
[25:22.520 --> 25:28.480]  threatened to pay freezes over gun control opposition and they've now gone public because
[25:28.480 --> 25:32.560]  in that state uh i guess it's controlled by the state what sheriffs are paid it shouldn't
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.040]  be that way sheriffs should be more independent at the county level what the county wants
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.560]  to pay them it is a division of the state though uh and they were told and they've now
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.320]  gone on record multiple sheriffs you will have your pay cut and so will the deputies
[25:44.320 --> 25:49.120]  if you don't take the guns i mean that is so criminal ladies and gentlemen i mean that's
[25:49.120 --> 25:55.760]  that's bribery right there uh here's another one out of ap enterprise ap uh enterprise
[25:55.760 --> 26:00.720]  whatever that means president nixon wished for total handgun ban this is run in every
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.760]  paper i've seen houston chronicle dallas morning news austin american station right
[26:04.760 --> 26:10.120]  here in austin i looked it up politico ran it they're really pushing this that hey it's
[26:10.120 --> 26:14.520]  conservative nixon wanted you to turn in your handguns nixon was a eugenicist new world
[26:14.520 --> 26:20.560]  order globalist who opened up communist china to get all our jobs and had price controls
[26:20.560 --> 26:26.580]  but because democrats went after him conservatives worship him richard nixon out clinton bill
[26:26.580 --> 26:32.520]  clinton if you really knew who he was now he was uh actually in charge he was a globalist
[26:32.520 --> 26:36.480]  but he was running things so they destroyed him because there's a lot of power uh you
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.240]  know infighting going on but that's why we're in so much trouble and it shows how far we've
[26:41.240 --> 26:47.960]  come though back in the 60s and 70s they almost got all the guns they almost got rid of our
[26:47.960 --> 26:52.360]  military then as well and put it under un then under state department memorandum and
[26:52.360 --> 27:02.920]  public law 7277 so that's the type of stuff going on look up 7277 the manuals online where
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.680]  we have no military our police are disarmed and un troops are here that's why you've always
[27:07.680 --> 27:13.160]  heard oh that's coming but we've held it back the old timers by warning people bought us
[27:13.160 --> 27:17.920]  a lot of time so they've incrementally put a lot of it in but not all of it so that's
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.200]  why you can read what the john birch society said in the 60s people like this is crazy
[27:22.200 --> 27:28.360]  now it's all come true basically we held it back they wanted this stuff by the 70s brazinski's
[27:28.360 --> 27:34.600]  written books on that he's one of their top statisticians so i'm begging you to become
[27:34.600 --> 27:40.640]  aware of all of this and again a un department of peace sounds great but it means everybody
[27:40.640 --> 27:47.720]  else has their guns taken but them including governments okay here's another one share
[27:47.720 --> 27:54.200]  of homes with guns shows four decade decline a new york times bologna piece they have a
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.760]  poll where they call people up and ask if you own guns and they say a record number
[27:58.760 --> 28:04.320]  say they don't but then i have the numbers in the last three years they've seen i meant
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.440]  to cover this we guys print gun sales triples i saw i think was reuters yesterday gun sales
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.440]  have tripled the last three years and they're and they're set to more than triple again
[28:14.440 --> 28:17.680]  when the numbers come out for this year but they're always a few months behind the first
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.080]  few months of this year i mean everybody knows the guns are sold out everybody knows every
[28:22.080 --> 28:26.040]  liberal i know has gone out and woken up and bought guns you know it's coming out that
[28:26.040 --> 28:31.780]  gabrielle giffords husband's buying ar-15s they caught mayor bloomberg's top anti-gun
[28:31.780 --> 28:39.440]  guy you know out buying ar-15s and shooting them i mean it's all coming out you constantly
[28:39.440 --> 28:44.900]  catch michael moore with guns or shooting on his property the photos get leaked or bodyguards

[28:56.640 --> 29:03.860]  carries in their cities they are gun they don't want you to have a gun and that brings
[29:03.860 --> 29:09.520]  me to my next article dh has to purchase more firearms as arm buildup intensifies info awards
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.480]  dot com fords ask if huge ammo buys should become national conversation and again the
[29:14.480 --> 29:17.920]  reason we know this is their chink in the armor one of the big ones they got a quite
[29:17.920 --> 29:22.840]  a few armored scales missing and there's pink dragon belly right there we'll just use it
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.040]  they run screaming saying this doesn't exist but now a lot of mainstream media is going

[33:05.560 --> 33:08.880]  Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:08.880 --> 33:26.440]  arriba mi gente rise up my people with an image of the border being flooded by upraised
[33:26.440 --> 33:34.560]  fist and black flags the mexico pouring into texas you have the globalists that have captured
[33:34.560 --> 33:40.860]  this country financially for 50 years paying for textbooks in mexico saying the southwest
[33:40.860 --> 33:46.120]  belongs to mexico and mexico depending on which part of the southwest it was only had
[33:46.120 --> 33:52.400]  the southwest for between 10 and 20 years and so did five other countries off and on
[33:52.400 --> 33:58.960]  that's why there's the six flags of texas but it's taught mexico is poor because the
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.960]  southwest was taken the truth is spain and mexico couldn't hold the southwest so they
[34:03.960 --> 34:12.720]  invited the anglo settlers predominantly which were experts at taking over and killing everybody
[34:12.720 --> 34:19.460]  into the area okay for giant indian wars and that's what went on and it was pretty much
[34:19.460 --> 34:23.520]  toe to toe it's not like it was just one group ganging up on the other it'd be one native
[34:23.520 --> 34:27.720]  group coming and saying help us kill the other native group so it's just all humans acting
[34:27.720 --> 34:34.440]  the same way barbarism and it organizes around race or culture okay in fact a lot of native
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.160]  tribes would hate the next native tribe a lot more than they hated the uh you know the
[34:39.160 --> 34:45.780]  round-eyed fork-a-tongued uh whites so the worst would rise to the top balkanization
[34:45.780 --> 34:51.100]  and the same reason the natives couldn't unify and hold north america was the same reason
[34:51.100 --> 34:56.840]  that the globalists are engaging in divide and conquer today it's called divide and conquer
[34:56.840 --> 35:00.640]  it's called balkanization the british call it the great game so if you want to actually
[35:00.640 --> 35:05.180]  know how the world works instead of getting in your racial group and feeling powerful
[35:05.180 --> 35:10.400]  then i'm the man for you to listen to if you want to actually be informed here's the article

[36:08.600 --> 36:13.040]  stuff to me and it's just ongoing when i was in high school in art class they said let's
[36:13.040 --> 36:19.720]  take a art uh trip to the university of texas to see an art display it was one of the professors
[36:19.720 --> 36:24.240]  and it was america's bad white people are bad this country's evil and and i knew some
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.760]  history i was a senior in high school and i said well wait a minute i said mexico had
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.960]  a lot of tyranny against the natives as well and there was a lot of oppression and you
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.800]  know santa ana was a dictator i mean guatemala threw him off and yeah there were revolts
[36:39.800 --> 36:44.520]  against him in mexico and and you know over a third of the founders of texas were hispanic
[36:44.520 --> 36:49.360]  and you're not that's not taught what's your agenda here and it was basically communism
[36:49.360 --> 36:55.560]  the guy was up there preaching communism uh you know race-based liberation theology so
[36:55.560 --> 37:01.840]  see i'm against aborting hispanic babies and having forced abortion in mexico which is
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.160]  now going on i'm against hispanics having a what is it three thousand percent increase
[37:07.160 --> 37:13.760]  over that in type 2 diabetes the last 20 years it i mean aspartame wood alcohol just hits
[37:13.760 --> 37:18.340]  hispanics genetically i mean i don't like driving by and seeing hispanics at every bus
[37:18.340 --> 37:22.960]  stop and i've seen this before with with their legs sawed off young ones you know some evil
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.240]  racist white guy i'd like to go tell them how to not have their legs sawed off but as
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.280]  long as i said lori conquista hell i could blow their houses up if i wanted to and they
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.200]  thanked me for it if i gave them a pat on the head and said oh i'm evil white that's
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.680]  right you'll take over now let's saw your legs off it's it's it's social engineers the
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.600]  same ones that took over the black community margaret sanger saying 80 years ago you pull
[37:44.600 --> 37:50.160]  up her letters online we cover my film endgame she says you know these are black weeds these
[37:50.160 --> 37:56.060]  are subhuman but they don't trust whites we've got to hire educated blacks pay them off and
[37:56.060 --> 38:00.040]  get control of these people so we can abort them and kill them and they kill 52 of blacks
[38:00.040 --> 38:06.300]  are never born so actually all the white supremacist people out there you should love the liberals
[38:06.300 --> 38:11.700]  in planned parenthood and i guess you do that's why you hate me so much but again whenever
[38:11.700 --> 38:17.400]  i point this out it's racist hispanics just going crazy in the comments on youtube and
[38:17.400 --> 38:23.120]  info wars i mean i i showed in a piece some guys that'll sing songs for you down on the
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.800]  border through the mountains and i put a clip of that in my big ben thing and i thought
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.060]  it was super romantic i didn't want to leave i wanted to just keep paying the guy five
[38:33.060 --> 38:36.840]  dollars and have him sing i put a clip of that in there that i just thought was beautiful
[38:36.840 --> 38:42.400]  singing and they said look at the racist showing a mexican singing no you're the racist against
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.860]  your own people you're the people that are idiots that have bought into this whole mind
[38:46.860 --> 38:51.880]  control i want you to succeed and i want you to get up off your mind control butts and
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.520]  realize that when the globalist engineer this anywhere they play groups in africa they'll
[38:56.520 --> 39:01.560]  play one group of animus off against the other animus same genetics look almost you know
[39:01.560 --> 39:05.800]  like each other like cousins but they live across the river from each other and they
[39:05.800 --> 39:10.000]  hate each other all day and they'll come and beg white you know mercenaries we'll give
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.740]  you all the diamonds just kill all of them it's it's racial division it's gang mentality
[39:16.740 --> 39:25.800]  it's putting humans in gangs and that's the type of stuff we're talking about here ladies
[39:25.800 --> 39:33.440]  and gentlemen to where to where things are so racially heightened and there's so much
[39:33.440 --> 39:40.720]  tension that if i put a clip of somebody who sings from the side of the mexico border through
[39:40.720 --> 39:47.080]  the boquias canyon and it sounds magic cameras can't pick it up he knows it sounds beautiful
[39:47.080 --> 39:52.140]  i can't show a minute of somebody singing without mexicans saying it's racist i'm making
[39:52.140 --> 39:57.700]  fun of mexicans you have a bad view of yourself you think you're ugly you think you're bad
[39:57.700 --> 40:01.900]  you think you've got a score to settle and as long as you can pull me down you're going
[40:01.900 --> 40:09.140]  to succeed that's not how this world works not in the 21st century especially this is
[40:09.140 --> 40:14.820]  the global technocrats against all of humanity and that's what we're facing you look at the
[40:14.820 --> 40:19.300]  prisons they didn't naturally get like this where we have four plus million people in
[40:19.300 --> 40:25.620]  prison more than communist china has over a billion 300 million people they create the
[40:25.620 --> 40:30.960]  hispanic gangs the asian gangs the white gangs the black gangs and they're run by the warden
[40:30.960 --> 40:36.200]  and the gang racial leaders all report to him and if you don't want to be in a racial
[40:36.200 --> 40:42.580]  gang and get all the tattoos and get bent over and and and and and and submit to this
[40:42.580 --> 40:50.500]  you get thrown in solitary confinement or stabbed to death and again they they let the
[40:50.500 --> 40:54.500]  criminals run fraud out of the prisons so they can then buy drugs from the jail guards
[40:54.500 --> 40:59.420]  i mean this is all on record and this is converting our culture with mtv and all of it to the
[40:59.420 --> 41:04.140]  tough guy you're not tough unless you're a criminal you're not tough unless you know
[41:04.140 --> 41:09.200]  when you become a criminal it's designed to lose your rights it's designed to make you
[41:09.200 --> 41:17.100]  a slave reject the criminal gang banger culture reject the white supremacist uh gang banger
[41:17.100 --> 41:22.220]  culture the hispanic gang banger culture the black gang banger culture the asian gang banger
[41:22.220 --> 41:27.740]  culture reject it all but notice what the globalist attack they attack people fleeing
[41:27.740 --> 41:31.540]  to the countryside black white hispanic believe me i live in the countryside trying to have
[41:31.540 --> 41:35.980]  gardens trying to raise their kids right they just want to raise their kids right you know
[41:35.980 --> 41:39.780]  black homeschoolers live out in the countryside near near where i do they just want to have
[41:39.780 --> 41:43.300]  some horses and chickens and and they know what's going on and they're listeners as i've
[41:43.300 --> 41:46.380]  talked to them ran into them at the store hey we're listeners blah blah blah and then
[41:46.380 --> 41:49.900]  i wonder where they live they're running people like that they're just like me they're just
[41:49.900 --> 41:54.860]  they care about their kids they want a future but they say oh the racist whites are fleeing
[41:54.860 --> 42:01.560]  to the countryside well my gosh if you don't like being stalked and and and having racial
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.620]  epithets yelled at you at the gas station when you go into a minority neighborhood or
[42:06.620 --> 42:11.660]  you don't like being physically attacked or mugged see you're a racist if you're white
[42:11.660 --> 42:16.900]  you should take your kids out and have the have the the the racial gangs kill them to
[42:16.900 --> 42:22.540]  prove you know you're bad you should say i love the city of austin paying fifteen thousand
[42:22.540 --> 42:29.260]  dollars for each billboard that says arise my people showing an army flooding over into
[42:29.260 --> 42:34.720]  texas and then show the young woman being paid to do this saying yes i want us to be
[42:34.720 --> 42:41.260]  proud of our people of mexico and i'm from laredo well why don't you move to nuevo laredo
[42:41.260 --> 42:44.980]  where thousands die every year and there's rocket attacks on newspapers because you won't
[42:44.980 --> 42:49.260]  have to though because we're going to be a narco terrorist state just like mexico and
[42:49.260 --> 42:58.060]  that's the globalist plan you'll never hear la raza which means the race you know imagine
[42:58.060 --> 43:01.660]  if i started a group called the race we're starting a group called the race for white
[43:01.660 --> 43:06.620]  people i mean i have the articles here i have a newscast right here california students
[43:06.620 --> 43:13.780]  sent home for wearing u.s flags on cinco de mayo remember that ap judge back school that
[43:13.780 --> 43:17.600]  sent home students wearing american flag shirts on cinco de mayo and by the way they were
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.860]  hispanic and it turned out most of the kids were hispanic they sent like what is it nine
[43:22.860 --> 43:28.420]  kids home one day and it turned out they didn't even wear them on purpose the american flags
[43:28.420 --> 43:32.420]  on tons of apparel it turned out it was i think one of them was an american apparel
[43:32.420 --> 43:37.120]  shirt i mean i got stuff with american flags on it because i know what the real good parts
[43:37.120 --> 43:41.320]  of america stand for that flag's mine i'm not giving it to the globalist look there's
[43:41.320 --> 43:45.780]  american flag was just behind me and so this is what it's gotten to we're all over the
[43:45.780 --> 43:52.740]  country they pull down american flags and stomp on them at postal service uh post offices
[43:52.740 --> 43:59.580]  and and it's crazed it's crazed racial garbage and then no one's supposed to talk about it
[43:59.580 --> 44:04.220]  as they run tv ads we've shown these on on by the way white owned you know you know big
[44:04.220 --> 44:08.540]  uh spanish uh cable systems and stuff in the u.s you can look these up i think i'm gonna
[44:08.540 --> 44:14.860]  have watson one of the guys wrote a whole article on it going over the fact uh that
[44:14.860 --> 44:24.100]  if you look at it they have these big billboards saying la usa cross out usa mexico remember
[44:24.100 --> 44:31.440]  that a few years ago or big billboards that say la infasora or the the invasion or la
[44:31.440 --> 44:40.260]  reconquista the reconquering and this is what i was taught at anderson high school by actually
[44:40.260 --> 44:50.180]  my social studies teacher and then by the art teacher who by the way were white and
[44:50.180 --> 44:54.980]  they were there as technocrats knowing full well what they were doing you see that's the
[44:54.980 --> 44:59.780]  thing they know they want they do you think they want hispanics who by the way it's done
[44:59.780 --> 45:04.200]  deal for all the white supremacists out there hispanics are the future over half the kids
[45:04.200 --> 45:09.580]  in america are now hispanic in america but you know what the new world order can't have
[45:09.580 --> 45:14.180]  them going i want guns i want private property i want to raise my family i don't want to
[45:14.180 --> 45:20.620]  have forced inoculations i don't want forced abortion uh you're gonna have dirty leg dirty
[45:20.620 --> 45:28.900]  tochi sandal fake hippie beatnik garbage shoved down your throat just like latin america has
[45:28.900 --> 45:33.900]  is communism is the only way you got global corporate monopolies that love communism at
[45:33.900 --> 45:37.680]  the grassroots and that's what you're going to be forced to have and that's your future
[45:37.680 --> 45:43.340]  and that's what you get and folks i've sat there at demonstrations in austin where where
[45:43.340 --> 45:48.060]  they were where where there are guys that look just like shay guevara you know i mean
[45:48.060 --> 45:53.780]  they're they're into it with the hat the the the beard the whole deal and we shot video
[45:53.780 --> 45:58.060]  this we've shown it and they're wearing shirts remember a few years ago that said plan to
[45:58.060 --> 46:05.560]  san diego which was a plan to kill all whites over the age of 16 look up the plan of san
[46:05.560 --> 46:10.100]  diego ut endorses it on their website and i go over and i go you don't care about the
[46:10.100 --> 46:16.220]  abortion of hispanics no i don't we're going to get you uh you don't care about uh about
[46:16.220 --> 46:21.500]  all the the gmo the tyranny no we don't we're going to get you we know you're racist because
[46:21.500 --> 46:26.820]  you're white and and and it's just all part of this imaginary dressed up like soldiers
[46:26.820 --> 46:30.780]  we're gonna get you know get you but then at the same time people say well then why
[46:30.780 --> 46:34.740]  would you have something like a mortal technique on well he says that he understands communism
[46:34.740 --> 46:38.920]  as a system but doesn't think it's good and is part of the control mechanism and he says
[46:38.920 --> 46:43.100]  he wants to empower everybody and that he gets a lot of what i'm saying so i'm trying
[46:43.100 --> 46:49.420]  to reach out to people but the larger issue is is that at a at another level when whites
[46:49.420 --> 46:53.700]  are attacked and whites are told they're scum or white kids are beat up at school and then
[46:53.700 --> 46:59.020]  told by the school that's the way it is they they run not out of even racism and so what's
[46:59.020 --> 47:03.740]  happened is they use the leftist movement to make whites all guilty for social engineering
[47:03.740 --> 47:09.980]  not for general equality and empowerment then whites have figured that out and so instead
[47:09.980 --> 47:15.340]  of realizing the larger game plan they are running in droves and becoming super militant
[47:15.340 --> 47:19.220]  and and can't even call it racist they're just tribal they're like well i want other
[47:19.220 --> 47:24.980]  people to do good uh you know overall on average are sophisticated enough from education and
[47:24.980 --> 47:30.500]  things to get it but it doesn't matter i'm still not wanting and so whites get that and
[47:30.500 --> 47:36.180]  and again that's meant to have them be scared as a main gang with the government who will
[47:36.180 --> 47:41.980]  be the referee in all of this you see the government doesn't want the people together
[47:41.980 --> 47:45.980]  under bill of rights constitution declaration of independence which has never even been
[47:45.980 --> 47:51.140]  fully realized but produced more wealth than anything that earth's ever seen they don't
[47:51.140 --> 47:57.320]  want that they don't want that they want liberation theologies you know i said that to immortal
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.860]  technique i said well a lot of this is liberal liberation theology you're putting out that
[48:00.860 --> 48:05.540]  was put out by the globalist he goes well regardless it still has some good points well
[48:05.540 --> 48:13.060]  anything seductive does but do the globalist want to help mexico do the globalist want
[48:13.060 --> 48:17.260]  to help latin america the answer is no do the globalist want our guns to take care of
[48:17.260 --> 48:20.560]  the kids no they want them to enslave us has mexico taken all the guns and has the highest
[48:20.560 --> 48:26.140]  crime rate in the world yes do the are the globalist funding forced abortions in mexico
[48:26.140 --> 48:29.940]  are they funding forced sterilizations in mexico and you can say well there are too
[48:29.940 --> 48:37.300]  many people okay so i don't want mexicans dead i mean i want you to have kids you would
[48:37.300 --> 48:42.340]  lighten their eyes who love liberty because then they're a human being that's that's that's
[48:42.340 --> 48:47.740]  a soldier for freedom in the future but you know what it is it is an absolute even if
[48:47.740 --> 48:52.860]  i have goodwill even if i have a good heart i still know that this message will not get
[48:52.860 --> 48:57.060]  through to most whites most blacks most hispanics most asians you name it it's just it just
[48:57.060 --> 49:01.500]  feels too good to just say whites are the devil and then whites will say you're all
[49:01.500 --> 49:05.540]  the devil and then the government can play the part of referee it just feels too good
[49:05.540 --> 49:10.320]  to be losers it feels too good to be chumps it feels too good to believe in obama four
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.300]  years ago and have him come in and oh he's going to give me free health care and he doubles
[49:14.300 --> 49:20.280]  the health care cost and and lets insurance companies cut the type of care you get i won't
[49:20.280 --> 49:28.300]  have time to play the entire fall of the republic the extras from endgame battle for the republic
[49:28.300 --> 49:31.380]  unless professor griffith doesn't show up in the next hour which again entertainers
[49:31.380 --> 49:36.820]  are famous he is set so he's coming on so that needs to happen okay so so we'll have
[49:36.820 --> 49:44.020]  to play battle for the republic another day i want to challenge people online to go watch
[49:44.020 --> 49:47.860]  it it's another six years on youtube so it's not high res we're going to re-air it tonight
[49:47.860 --> 49:53.340]  in high res on the nightly news and i'm going to shoot an intro to that it's just this is
[49:53.340 --> 50:00.060]  an absolute paramount issue for you to understand and i'm going to go ahead and do this network
[50:00.060 --> 50:03.220]  break because i've got to stop skipping and when i come back i'm going to play a newscast
[50:03.220 --> 50:07.060]  where they said the kids are sent home for american flags see you're sent home for pointing
[50:07.060 --> 50:11.700]  your finger now of a pastry that isn't even a gun looks like it could be the shape of
[50:11.700 --> 50:16.460]  a gun you get kicked out of school it's it's mind control can't have an american flag can't
[50:16.460 --> 50:21.360]  have a pastry can't have a plastic knife to spread your jam at school your parents can't
[50:21.360 --> 50:26.740]  pack your lunch but you know what the city will pay for a billboard saying rise up hispanics

[54:24.900 --> 54:28.420]  hip-hop and a lot more this is gonna be a powerful interview i'm gonna try to shut up
[54:28.420 --> 54:34.380]  let him roll with his answers um you know on the subject of what's happening the globalists
[54:34.380 --> 54:41.820]  are scared to death of latin america full of really smart hard-working people ever getting
[54:41.820 --> 54:48.480]  a 1776 ever figuring out private property not having el jefe's you know strong men over
[54:48.480 --> 54:52.420]  them that's what everybody fled from europe and then of course they just rebuilt the tyranny
[54:52.420 --> 54:57.180]  they lived under here but still there was that kernel of the enlightenment and the renaissance
[54:57.180 --> 55:04.520]  and freedom and when you when i see the big global corporations and the big white owned
[55:04.520 --> 55:13.220]  it's very interesting uh you know anglo-owned uh jewish-owned you name it major media uh
[55:13.220 --> 55:18.580]  this is different owners but we've done whole reports on it pushing hey la is mexico hey
[55:18.580 --> 55:25.180]  texas is mexico hey revolt hey get white people race sells at a primitive level for everybody
[55:25.180 --> 55:30.220]  and it makes sense and everybody's been wrong one way or the other and so then you start
[55:30.220 --> 55:34.780]  blaming whole groups and they say hey support democratic party support socialism support
[55:34.780 --> 55:39.580]  gun control you know show whitey take his guns that's going to be your guns that are
[55:39.580 --> 55:46.200]  taken the globalist everything they do is anti-human i'll assure you if you're a quote
[55:46.200 --> 55:51.140]  minority which is really the majority now in this country the globalists do not have
[55:51.140 --> 55:54.460]  your best interest at heart and they don't have my best interest at heart and white people
[55:54.460 --> 55:59.060]  do not get a memo saying don't drink hydrofluorosolic acid they don't get a memo saying don't eat
[55:59.060 --> 56:04.080]  gmo soy they don't get a memo saying don't put your kids in public school they don't
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.660]  get a memo they get a memo saying you're evil because you're white if you marry a white
[56:08.660 --> 56:15.220]  person it's because you're racist uh and blah blah blah and and again they forced a gangster
[56:15.220 --> 56:20.540]  culture onto everybody whatever you see done in the black community is a beta test on record
[56:20.540 --> 56:25.060]  they test everything in the black community they don't just inject black people as simple
[56:25.060 --> 56:29.220]  as folks they've been caught injecting everybody that doesn't lessen what happened to blacks
[56:29.220 --> 56:33.700]  they've gotten the the the really bad end of the stick because they were a group seen
[56:33.700 --> 56:39.460]  as inferior and oh it's okay the globalist could get away with more of that everybody's
[56:39.460 --> 56:45.640]  being hit by this we're in this together and i really want to beat the globalist i really
[56:45.640 --> 56:50.700]  do uh and you know i'll be honest with you it wouldn't be such an issue of 30 million
[56:50.700 --> 56:54.860]  illegal aliens were here if they weren't on welfare a lot of them and if they were constitutionalist
[56:54.860 --> 56:58.080]  it would support the second amendment and support property rights the problem is i see
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.200]  the polls they vote over 90 you see all the illegal voting going on but even once they're
[57:03.200 --> 57:08.220]  citizens to take guns for socialism i mean my god they had a whole bunch of the hispanic
[57:08.220 --> 57:13.760]  congress people endorse hugo chavez when he died and shagwa vara and socialism and total
[57:13.760 --> 57:21.760]  gun bans i mean whoa whoa i mean go talk to conservative cuban americans how about all

[57:25.300 --> 57:30.660]  state overnight i mean this is a serious issue they attach communism and socialism it's a
[57:30.660 --> 57:40.060]  globalist control tool on the racial liberation theology agendas i want us all liberated i
[57:40.060 --> 57:45.980]  want everybody empowered i genuinely know you reap what you sow man if i even think

[58:01.220 --> 58:06.460]  thought my brain is looking at different angles i go and actually shake inside that's what

[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:17.820]  dollars a year who think somebody who's rich is making 125 000 individually quarter million
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:27.040]  with the husband and wife or the spouse or significant other and can you imagine can
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:35.420]  you imagine what we're talking about here of the person making thirty thousand dollars
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:41.380]  a year thinking somebody making 125 000 a year is not paying enough at forty percent
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:45.420]  just federal there's all the other dozens of taxes dozens and dozens and dozens some
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.580]  cases over a hundred different taxes depending on the state you live in hundred different
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.820]  taxes fines fees regulations and the average person making you know who they call rich
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.980]  over 125 000 a year is paying over 65 percent in some form of tax and that's not enough
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:03.460]  and then you got people with hundreds of billions a year offshore and they're not paying jack
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:10.060]  diddly squat and they're lobbying for more of the people that make 125 000 a year of

[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.960]  one of the icons one of the founders of rap and what is hip-hop I mean you can't really
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.760]  think of anybody out there except a couple other guys who are up there at the top of
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.060]  the mountain is internationally renowned educator writer producer musician platinum
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:51.080]  recording spoken word artist lecturer and founding member of the pioneering and revolutionary
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.320]  hip-hop group Public Enemy author of the popular music business guide I'm not going to go over
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.000]  his whole bio everybody knows who professor Griff is or they've been hiding under a rocker
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.400]  if they don't they'll recognize his voice but the point is is his website we're also
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:12.040]  going to be giving that out for everybody it's pgriff.info we're going to have that
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:19.380]  up on screen for everybody as well just the letter pgriff.info and they're on tour right
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:24.160]  now they're going into the rock and roll hall of fame this year and I've been following
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.960]  professor Griff since I was about 11 years old as I grew up in Dallas and you know was
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.840]  on the football team a lot of my friends you know we introduced me to you know the first
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.340]  rap that was coming on I really loved it along with rock and roll and everything else out
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:41.640]  there but I really love Public Enemy and just the sound and so then over the years I kind
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.800]  of followed along with what professor Griff was really saying and then would see how the
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.600]  media would spin and distort and also some of the government stuff he's gone through
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.040]  but he can get into that if he wants to we'll get into the Illuminati and hip-hop which
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.640]  is just constantly thrown in our face but also in rock and roll so many hip-hop and
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.040]  rock and roll folks have now gone public and said they're told to do that by the business
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.920]  I've talked to former high-level people from MTV and major rock stars who were in the meetings
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:11.600]  when they said we're gonna stop pushing all this grassroots rock and hip-hop you know
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.720]  rap we're gonna go with gangster kill them you know all this garbage so that was on purpose
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.880]  we're gonna get into all that with him we're gonna talk about so much more here today with
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.320]  professor Griff on the broadcast with us I've got a lot of questions he's got a lot of points
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.840]  he wants to make we were just talking there on the break professor Griff first it was
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.040]  great to hear your voice over the line and it's great to have you here with us today
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:41.280]  oh just thanks likewise um I just want to let you know that um I've been an info warrior
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:47.120]  for a minute uh unbeknownst to a lot of people um I was an info warrior when it wasn't even
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:57.040]  popular to be one in the hood wow wow especially in rap and hip-hop because there's not too
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.840]  many people like myself that was disseminating information and as Malcolm X said by any means
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.640]  necessary but we say by any all that every means necessary well you were an info warrior
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.440]  before I was an info warrior well I was there oh I was there on the scene disseminating information
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.800]  however I could get it um it's just that I didn't have access uh to a lot of information I had to
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.120]  pick it up wherever I could pick it up from well I've been fascinated in my off time listening to
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.160]  a lot of uh underground interviews you do also some big ones uh you know just laying you know
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.480]  down a lot of deep knowledge let's let's give you the floor here uh you know first off you
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.560]  want to get into getting the info out let's talk about it well disseminating the information
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.200]  I think is a three-step process first of all you have to be awake and aware to even
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.000]  want to seek the information out then there comes the time where you you you you don't have to quote
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.760]  unquote believe it I don't get into the whole concept of belief and then faith um and I know
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.680]  some of the religious people that are listening please go look those two words up and then you can
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.080]  call professor griffith directly we can talk but you have to have some courage to disseminate
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:09.440]  information on this certain degree of uh of um of courageousness you have to have in order to
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:17.440]  disseminate the information not only in this uh small group of people that surround us
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.640]  that are ready to listen to it but take it out to the 85% of the masses of the people
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.600]  that really are not checking for it so to speak so we have to be able to put it in a language that
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.000]  the people understand and when public enemy first came out coming out of long island new york
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.680]  people were not checking for a small rap group speaking truth to power talking about the
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.800]  government talking about local and global issues it was very very difficult thing so the threats
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:49.040]  came from sometimes from within the side the black community but the threats came from um
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.560]  some ignorant uh white folks some threats came from from abroad especially when we when we went
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.000]  internationally we started making the connection because as you know uh alex that the news that
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.440]  we get from america is not the same news you get from abroad no it's in it's from all different
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.960]  angles so you start really seeing the propaganda when you see the foreign news exactly so then you
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.800]  start to tie the two together then when you start meeting people from different cultures
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:21.120]  you start to get a well-rounded view on what this thing is actually uh actually about and i've seen
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:27.040]  it at a young age and by the time by the time the public enemy thing happened we went abroad
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.320]  the shocking thing that shocked me as you just admitted that you've been following this thing
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:39.680]  and since 11 12 years old but now it's being older white men bringing their sons and their
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:47.360]  and their grandchildren to the concerts and it's a beautiful thing and as i told you during the
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.440]  break the public enemy it's never been about a white and black thing always been about the human
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:58.800]  family well i want to expand more on that but at its core what is the new world order what is the
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.520]  illuminati what is its end game because it's carrying out as you know eugenics operations
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.760]  against everybody but the apple of its eye is africa uh and that's where in some countries you
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.160]  know they've carried out bioweapons attacks and killed more than half the people and and and and
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.480]  so many quote liberal yuppies are like well there are too many people well wait a minute i thought
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:25.040]  you're this big liberal i mean you're really gonna sign on just make a joke about and tacitly admit
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.800]  that you know this stuff's going on but it's something we're just gonna keep in the back of
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.680]  the room i mean huge things are going on is my point what is at the heart from your research
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.720]  all the books you've written the videos everything you've got on your site uh what is at the core of
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.960]  this the end game i think the end game um once again is this um it's three or four different
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.760]  things but i think the end game is population control and if we can probably if we can control
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:55.360]  the population by controlling certain individuals and certain aspects on what's going on on global
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.040]  scale then i think um they will they will become successful but i truly believe in my heart of
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:09.440]  hearts that they will not be successful at all we um we have set them back several times for
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.960]  them to go back to the growing board so the end game would be population control the end game
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.120]  with um controlling the population would be mind control the end game would be even if we're uh
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.920]  we're existing on the planet that's all we're doing is existing uh we're useless eaters to them
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:32.240]  we're units as they wrote about us in rec 80 for the king alfred plant we're useless we're
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:38.080]  useless eaters we're sheeple business we're just here almost like like zombies and they actually
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.360]  have a drug on the street now i don't know if you've heard of tamale it's definitely happening
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.920]  in the black community where you see these guys it's almost like you meet you're meeting them
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:53.920]  you're seeing them it's like the lights are on but no one's home that's what they want they
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:00.000]  gaze and there's praise over their eyes and you really can't even reach them um with designer
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.920]  drugs like this on the street it buys it buys into the whole idea of the end game these mind
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.400]  controlled kind of uh manchurian candidates so to speak kind of zombies that are operating out here
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:18.800]  you know it's funny you mentioned that trance uh i came across videos that i'd seen at the time when
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:24.480]  they were first leaked 15 years ago or so of clinton when makeup's being put on him or during
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.680]  interviews and i've talked to people that knew clinton had him on the show uh you know had on
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.640]  girlfriends old friends people attacked by him that clinton would like go into these baby-like
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.920]  trances whenever he'd get on the telephone and get orders and that sounds crazy to people that
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.480]  haven't actually watched it but later i'm going to show tv viewers we'll post it on infowars
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.480]  a couple clips of clinton during satellite feeds when he wasn't live shifting into something that's
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:58.480]  not a joke he's clearly in like a three-year-old mind control trance exactly and and now um it's
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.720]  not only with uh the uh bill clinton's of the world uh these are the actual these are actual
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:11.200]  average everyday citizens black white and everyone in between and they're doing it fire
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:18.080]  frequencies fire the music that's right fire the food fire the drugs fire uh these uh these uh
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.720]  literal these frequencies these low frequency they admit that televisions and thousands of studies
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.600]  will literally thousands as you know but for listeners he's not joking here is rewiring kids
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.840]  brains making them highly suggestible and most people are now in a sleep state a a a a a waking
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:41.040]  uh oh what's the proper term sleepwalking state right we did a song called the night of the living
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:48.400]  best hits yes this was when this was when um crack cocaine had hit and it was our answer to it and
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.400]  um it's functional functional zombies functional crackheads you know they're under this a lot of
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.720]  times they don't even know it and when you make them aware of these particular things then they
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:06.320]  call you crazy it's amazing i've done a test where you actually give people commands on the street
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.480]  and if you do it confidently they'll start obeying like robots even police
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.360]  and and it's it's really freaking me out because what you're saying is true the public more and
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.640]  more is going into deeper and deeper levels of a trance how do we break them out of that
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.120]  i think what we need to do is make people awake and aware that we have to put living food in a
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.320]  living body this is the only way we have to put living living information when i say food i mean
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.280]  on a spiritual level intellectual level mental level and a physical level so when i say food
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.400]  i just don't need physical food but you have to put food living food in a living body there's
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.560]  no other way to keep the human being alive we have to feed the human being living living food
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.200]  if this information that you and i and all of the info warriors that are out there trying to
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.760]  disseminate to the people who are not viable and alive um we should not possibly um continue to
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:07.280]  particular work simply because it's dead information it's dead information so today 2013
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.640]  if we're having a conversation on the alex jones show and we regurgitate and do the obama
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.400]  deception remix it has to be viable to today what's going on with eric holder what's going
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.200]  on with drones do we need to talk about this today what does that have to do with the music
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.520]  and the masks of the people i want to get into that let's talk about your book and we'll put it
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:36.160]  on screen dealing with the cia covert war the psychological covert uh war on hip-hop and how
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.280]  they've branded it and how they've taken it over and turned it into the culture killing thing that
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.520]  it is today again the minister of information for public enemy being inducted to the rock and
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:54.000]  roll hall of fame uh this year professor griff is our guest and the website is p uh griff dot info
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.880]  please continue well you didn't there wasn't a 40th but you said it right it's the cia's
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:08.080]  back in 1976 i don't know if you took me with a young lady her name is may brussels yes
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:15.120]  well in her operation chaos as she called it from the monterey pop um to the different festivals that
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:21.280]  went on doing this during the uh during the 60s she said that there was a cia war against the 60s
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.560]  cataculture and after reading that document it said it set something off in my mind i'm thinking
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:34.160]  well that's the same thing that's going on now may brussels said this back then so when i started
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:39.600]  putting together the psychological covert war on hip-hop i had to go back and revamp the book and
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:45.840]  i had to talk about the illuminati's takeover of hip-hop now some people thought i was crazy but
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.920]  when i looked inside of hip-hop and i started seeing some of the information that you talk
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.880]  about on your show some of the information that jordan maxwell michael tesarian and david eich
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.880]  and some other people talk about i'm like wow i'm seeing that those things in hip-hop so i wonder if
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:06.480]  if i could make the connection so when i did make the connection once again it took a lot out of me
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:12.880]  to present it to relatively a group of people that was just close to it so i had to become
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.400]  civil literate and when i started explaining what was going on it landed me in some trouble on some
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.720]  things that i don't care to speak about right now because of a lawsuit but i can just kind of hint
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:29.040]  around it right now they're attacking me simply because i'm pointing out the uh the effemintization
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:36.640]  the effemintization of the african male inside of hip-hop and because of that we have some high uh
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.000]  some people that are on high so to speak they're probably high but they're on high um so to speak
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.680]  that wanna shut professor griff down but they're doing it by trying to attack public enemy as a
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:52.080]  whole and i don't want to threaten the brothers chances of getting into the rock and roll hall of
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.920]  fame to this ask me to handle this kind of conversation kind of like with kid gloves i
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:02.880]  said i don't mind because this is not about professor group it's no big i and little u
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.720]  this thing is a lot larger than professor griff but i can't say this
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.320]  we're walking around today and you're walking through the malls and you you're seeing young
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.960]  people and the effemintization is going on especially among young uh black um kids from
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:28.480]  the ages of 12 to 21 should i not speak on it because if fcd is on the rise if homosexuality
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:33.600]  and bisexuality is on the rise i'm not i don't care what people sleep with in the privacy of
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.440]  their own homes i'm saying if it's affecting the masses of the people the point is when
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.480]  when they're pushing for folks to have 200 sexual partners in a week and that's no joke ladies and
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:48.560]  gentlemen these people are ended up dying of hiv and hepatitis and all this it is extremely
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.960]  destructive the lifestyle of drugs and sex and all of this being pushed and it's everywhere
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.920]  where they are pushing this on little kids everywhere as as is in the documents for
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  population control because once they've gotten rid of masculinity and men the state is now the
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:11.280]  daddy and he can kill mommy and the kids hitler said first you get the women then you've got the
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:17.280]  children so follow the men they've got to get rid of men basically that's why they feed us estrogen
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:22.720]  in the food and the plastics it hyper feminizes women so they're the big you know boss uh you
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.720]  know the house slaves what i call it white women black women it doesn't matter the romans figured
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.040]  it out with their white german slaves you put the women in the house the men as slaves outside the
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.760]  women will oppress the men and then you hyper feminize the the women with the estrogens and
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:44.560]  it turns the men into the little uh uh m uh or or little w women go ahead i got it i just got
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.880]  a text on my other line someone apparently is listening i just got a text and they said
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:55.280]  um just be a little bit more transparent you do have to go ahead so i'm taking the distance
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.680]  someone listening that's handling this case so let me be a little bit more transparent
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:06.400]  these these two people that i'm speaking of are in particularly quincy jones and will smith
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:14.160]  when the information came to me it came to me in confidence and um i gave my words to the individual
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:20.720]  that i will not reveal my story but when i put it out i didn't want quincy jones with mith
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.880]  the faith i was actually attacking them what you just said was beautiful because i seen these
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:34.000]  feminization a process going on in the in hip-hop along with that went through a thing it went through
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.480]  the first phase was you had to be there to understand hip-hop wasn't too many people out
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.440]  in the dark in the park with us do you understand what hip-hop was giving birth to that second phase
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:49.520]  of hip-hop was the golden era the conscious era era which gave birth to four right discussions
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:57.120]  wise intelligent uh brand new beings public enemy big daddy queen kms one some of the other some of
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.840]  the other groups that uh were very positive at that particular time shortly after that
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.440]  gangsta rap kick in the neutralized conscious hip-hop with a neutralized conscious hip-hop
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:13.840]  when we caught an album that dr drae put out um conscious hip-hop was dead at that point
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.320]  this is when we started the city feminization process and bugging and balling and pimping
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:25.680]  and all these negative things entered into hip-hop and we seen hip-hop on the decline
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.080]  now we don't even have hip-hop we just have a rap and i think you're listening to understand
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.120]  the difference between the two hip-hop is the umbrella rap is one of the elements that
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:41.360]  got it yeah and we need to understand that well breaking this down when you said your phone got
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.920]  tapped into we just heard the audio uh change someone is listening in the quality is not as good
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:54.000]  uh are are you saying someone broke into your phone or what's going on no well i just got a
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.720]  message i don't know who the message came from and the messages came through the phone that
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.800]  i need to be a little bit more transparent well that's crazy uh that that actually heard audio
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.480]  change on the phone when you said that somebody broke in on the phone expanding on this uh how
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:19.840]  have you seen uh can i just make just a quick statement number one i don't want the people out
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.760]  there that have that homosexual lifestyle who think that we're attacking them that's not our
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.040]  job we don't do that and that's definitely not what i do um i don't do lectures and beat up on
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:35.600]  homosexual than anyone else through the information that you stated that's already um sure the point
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:41.680]  is is that when i pointed out that that all over the western world the fish are becoming bisexual
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:48.960]  and so are the frogs we are biologically being manipulated and and i don't get up here and bash
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:54.960]  people on race or sex or any of that the point is the point is in women it's accelerating breast
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.560]  cancer on record that's a fact the bisphenol a so so so let's i mean they call me a homophobe
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:06.240]  for saying hey little kids juice boxes are changing their sexual persuasion but also giving
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.680]  them cancer that's in major studies and they're scared to death when i bring that up they don't
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.320]  ever ask why are women dying of breast cancer at record numbers it's always let's find a cure why
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.000]  not let's find out why this is happening exactly and that's precisely my point so when i when i
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.480]  mentioned two of two of music's icons and entertainment icons will smith and pussy
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.600]  jones in my lecture all of a sudden now i'm a hater all of a sudden now i'm all these other
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:39.680]  kind of evil nasty names and then i get phone calls from their assistant saying that they want
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:45.840]  to see me well i'm available you have my number i put my number out on youtube millions of people
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.040]  have my number anyone can call me but i got the phone i received a phone call from their assistant
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.080]  i said well let's get up taste the face i never got a phone call back so this is not anything
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.240]  personal against pussy jones this is not anything personal against will smith i laid out the agenda
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:07.920]  that i put in my book the psychological covert war on hip-hop it is a war going on it's on a
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.840]  covert level and they're using the music to get with the people well look i don't want them
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.360]  teaching six-year-olds in school any type of sex period i mean that is absolutely out of control
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  that's going on worldwide you've heard about where they teach in u.s schools i can pull up
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:29.680]  guys type in six-year-olds taught to masturbate in public schools i mean period that is pedophilia
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.880]  and so you're talking about it i i don't know about the the beef going on uh i hadn't uh you
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.520]  know read your book yet but i do want to read it uh we've been showing it on screen so i'm not aware
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:46.000]  uh of the things you're raising but specifically i am aware of moves that i was told by executives
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.440]  to make it gangster to make it violent to make it uh anti-woman to make it thuggish to make it
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.840]  look like a big joke as a cultural poison things that krs-1 has talked about also in the obama
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.160]  deception what is your take on that professor griff one of the founders of public enemy
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.680]  well you see that is very very key simply because i've written this same document that's been put
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.880]  out there and it's true because some of the same record execs and some of the people that are tied
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:21.520]  into the multi-national corporation apparatus vivendi and other companies are the same people
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:28.080]  that own and invest in and have stock in private prisons so they have to fill the prison cells
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.720]  they have to fill the prison beds stay there we gotta go to break professor griff hard break

[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:39.760]  cut off in the break talking about the agenda of the takeover of hip-hop and rap what the system
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.160]  wants because they're invested in the prison complex with the biggest prison population
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:50.640]  they're now having folks can look this up prison guards from the big companies as guards at public
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.880]  schools literally inducting the kids into prison the new slavery uh everything is geared to get

[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.680]  professor griffin and lay out what you were saying during the break to me about the takeover
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.240]  of hip-hop because this is inside knowledge people need to know because control of music
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.440]  is the control of culture go ahead all right these are the conversations that i that i often have
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:22.400]  um um with chuck d uh when i run into uh mortal technique and uh wise intelligent
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.920]  of poor ranger teachers and other and other uh brothers that are here and that are doing uh hip
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:33.520]  pop that's involved in it that speak truth to power and our eyes are open we had a discussion
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:39.520]  in reference to the uh the anonymous letter that was put out on the internet uh the anonymous
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:46.640]  letter too long to read but in jess or this is it said that these executives had uh owned and
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:53.120]  have stock in uh private prisons and these are the same record execs that green life certain projects
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:38:00.480]  um the up-and-coming artists that you may see uh they control their entire uh careers
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:06.480]  based on these new contracts that's been in place for the last i'd say 10 years which is
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:13.200]  these contracts these deals called the 360 deal and what the 360 deal is is the fact that if you
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:19.440]  continue take a certain major circle and cut it up into eight pieces of a pie um put your cd or
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.480]  your album in the middle of that pie all the other pieces of the pie are ancillary properties based
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:30.080]  on the music that you put out so pieces of the pot would consist of merchandise deal live shows
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:35.920]  endorsements yada yada until you fill up the eight pieces of the pie that is your whole
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:43.280]  entire life that is a 360 deal so regardless of however you have make income money coming in
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:51.120]  they will they get a piece of that thus they control your entire life listen they have you
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:56.720]  for a lifetime because they are the ones responsible for new renewing your contract and
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.040]  then they have not only international rights and domestic rights now they have a new thing in the
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:08.640]  contract that says universal and global rights dealing with the universe so i read an article on
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.000]  how will.i.am is going to record something and send a song down from mars it's kind of magic
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.480]  dealing with holograms and see these people know what they're doing they're putting the things in
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:24.800]  the apparatus in place and they're maneuvering the artists um to buy into these 360 deals
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:31.600]  look at the super bowl it's openly illuminati with madonna and then the other lady this year
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:38.960]  i mean it's openly illuminati uh with janet jackson with all of it now with lady gaga with
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.920]  other women wearing you know people's teeth around their neck talking about killing kids
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:53.360]  666 what is the point behind all this i think to galvanize the uh the energy radiating from us as
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.960]  human beings to get everyone on the same page listen the big new brzezinski made a statement
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:06.080]  he says um in earlier days we could control um a million people as opposed to um killing a million
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.480]  people but i think ben he said then in latter day today we're talking about i think he said that we
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:17.280]  will uh it's easier to kill a million people as it is to control them well that's what he said he
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:23.280]  said exactly i mean the actual quote guys pull up it's something like you know 20,000 people
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:29.040]  20 years ago it was cheaper to to control and buy off a million people now it's cheaper to kill them
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:36.160]  right they felt that they could just control one individual like jay-z and if jay-z has a million
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:43.040]  two million fans then we could control those two to three million people pretty much pretty
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.600]  pretty much so but you have to keep that one individual in check but since the advent of the
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:53.120]  internet and this information out there people are becoming awake and aware to the schemes
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.920]  and the gains and they even said themselves recently that says only six percent of the
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:03.520]  population that believe that the news media is true this madness that comes from the media
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.240]  is multi-ethnic destruction in america because we know there's only a handful of people that
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:14.640]  control the media everything you touch taste smell and see on tv the big screen and the small screen
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:21.120]  is being controlled absolutely and look at the message now gun owners are racist
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.880]  the militia guys are going to start a race war and there's no real proof or truth there believe
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:31.680]  me i know i'm in it uh and it's everybody in it of all races colors and creeds wants freedom and
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.400]  knows the system the man wants our guns but they're running a script just like they did
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.280]  before oklahoma city and they're getting ready to stage false flag attacks in this country what's
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.480]  your take on that professor griff i think it's very very very true and um there's not anything
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.360]  there's not anything that we have to run around and and wear on our sleeves and convince people
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.840]  that this was true because it's happened in history before only thing we have to do is
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:02.960]  study history um and we talked about on the break about the agalian dialectic principle they control
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.320]  both sides they can exacerbate the tensions from extreme to extreme different camps and make it
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:14.560]  appear with a video or as they did in um wag the dog and some of these other movies what was the
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:21.920]  movie that they just got uh an award for the uh last week yeah zero dark easter bunny uh and argo
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.040]  all of it i mean argos more true than zero dark uh easter bunny as i call it but it's all a bunch
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:33.520]  of fiction made up garbage exactly so they can control both sides and then they can they can put
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.920]  it in you throw it in your subconscious mind and trigger it when they want to trigger it and they
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:44.720]  can trigger it with entertainment trigger with food trigger it with uh with the music with the vibrations
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:49.920]  in the music it'll make you think that there's a race role going on and it's nice bright and sunny
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:58.800]  outside and this is sad simply because we thought that once upon a time that we were making progress
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:04.560]  as far as the human family is concerned coming together uh then they made it they made it appear
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:11.280]  that we needed a barack obama but the whole idea of the barack obama was like you said was just
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:18.160]  uh a broad sweep of deception they used barack obama to get back into africa to sign off on
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:25.120]  african multinational corporations can go back to africa to colonize to recolonize africa to get the
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:31.520]  precious minerals they think that they need to continue to make iphones that i've had you're
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.800]  right and it was my own research webster tarp least countless others but we said they're going
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.280]  to take out libya they're going to take out syria africans going to invade at least 10 countries
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.520]  they made up that whole coney thing has been dead for six years to say that they can invade any
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.000]  country in africa now they are and even came out in several african countries last month that
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.560]  the presidents came out and said they're running al-qaeda to attack their own refineries as a
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:44:00.000]  pretext to invade it's totally fake mohammed karzai came out and said the u.s runs taliban
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.520]  al-qaeda two days ago more and more though the facade is falling when you say they're behind
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.960]  they say they're behind their own internal stuff that leaks you're absolutely right
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:14.560]  so how do you see this professor griff unfolding these people aren't god sure they have power as
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:18.960]  long as they're invisible and we don't know they're there but when we throw sand on them
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:23.840]  we can then you know see their outline more and more they're operating like they're invisible but
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.880]  they're not their old lies aren't working anymore where do you and your gut because i've heard you
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.120]  on other shows really roll with it you know me and you know what you're talking about where do you
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:38.720]  see this going in your 25 years of fighting the illuminati uh how do you see it all shaken out
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:46.880]  i think my gut is telling me that the masses of the people are becoming awake and aware we just
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:53.200]  need to get over some of the hurdles we have to begin to start trusting one another and trusting
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:45:00.560]  the information that we share with one another um i can't i can't begin to say to the people
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:06.880]  i mean just just just from my gut and the work i've done with chuck uh flavor and the rest of
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.960]  the guys in the group that we've been reaching out and reaching millions of people in the face
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:20.080]  of adversity we must begin to act like it's impossible to fail and the information how many
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.800]  times do alex shows professor griffith other people have to say same thing for the people
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:29.840]  to understand that this is what's going on in the world and these are the games and the tricks
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:36.320]  that they're playing we must begin we must begin to educate that those next info warriors coming
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.800]  behind us you understand how beautiful would it be if everybody just got that all the fake hip
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.520]  hop and establishment music that they sell us is meant to hurt us the message is obviously
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:53.760]  destructive couldn't people just flip and get it and understand it people say hey we want we want
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:00.240]  um you know easy solutions well politicians are going to tell you that but it is an easy
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:05.360]  solution it's wake up start resisting in little ways it will grow into big things what always
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.520]  frustrates me professor griff and i want to get your take on this is that every time i stand up
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.000]  nine times out of ten the system freaks out and runs in fear because they're not used to anybody
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.440]  standing up to them but but more people aren't standing up it's that the individual who's doing
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.720]  things for the right reason has incredible power and we're like 100 foot tall monsters
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:30.880]  to these new world order people they are scared of us yes they are but if i often said if there
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.480]  was a thousand professor christen we can kind of turn the tide we can say we can change some things
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:44.400]  sure um everywhere i go i meet someone that's like-minded like myself but it's just it's just
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:50.000]  that one person that may be in vegas or the two or three the two or three people in a study group
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:57.440]  in um in wisconsin somewhere um so it's it's not enough of us but i think what they're doing they
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.720]  understand our strategy our strategy is taking advantage of technology and reaching as many
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:09.040]  people as we can you know how many times my local app has been shut down corrupted
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.920]  paul's message is sent sent out in the middle of the night by the time that people wake up
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:19.520]  and they said grip i didn't know you was in the porn i said well i didn't send that message
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.920]  they said well they came from oh i know they do all sorts of dirty tricks and edit things well
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.760]  now we've confirmed i mean we've had it happen everybody in our office you send out a pro gun
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:33.520]  message they ban you or suspend you on facebook twitter starting it and they're doing it to little
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.320]  guys though not big guys so much and the others and under the radar but then they also do the
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.080]  false flags on big guys like yourself when they go after a big guy they do something like a
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.320]  misrepresentation and people don't know you don't know how real the new world order is that's one
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.760]  reason i say get involved get involved and run up against it then you'll know for yourself how real
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:59.040]  it is exactly i released the uh book analytics where i put the obama deception in my book
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:04.240]  i released the psychological covert war on hip-hop which is the next book and my new book the
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:10.800]  acapella revolution i released it a few weeks ago and they're stepping up they're attacked but now
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:18.560]  on different levels websites have been corrupted um like i said the cell phone app people are being
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.600]  they're harder to reach i thought the technology was desirable to reach more people at a faster
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:29.520]  pace well it seems like mines are slowing down for some strange reason i think that's deliberate
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.320]  i think that's deliberate here's an example they've taken speeches i've done and i warned
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:38.560]  of this a decade ago because i mean the technology was already there they'll take speeches that are
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:44.960]  mine my show no music no nothing and claim copyright on particularly powerful things
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.960]  and it'll be like mtv and it's me talking no music no nothing it'll be weird canadian companies and
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.920]  i've got to threaten to sue them and have lawyers actually send them tort letters to stop and it's
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.560]  always key stuff about real unity they know what breaks through and they go completely ape
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.720]  right this this is why i wrote the acapella revolution because the revolution is complete
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.400]  constructive conscious cosmic change we're going to bring about a change but it starts with the
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.600]  individual the individual's spirit and the individual's mind so the whole idea of
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:25.920]  acapella just speaking is without the music let's just have a conversation and start the dialogue
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:33.840]  and i think this is this is um my uh my attempt to put this information out there to slow these
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:40.080]  people and their agenda down this new world order illuminati agenda just slow it down to a grinding
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.280]  halt because if we have the dialogue at least we're coming together to at least have the dialogue
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:52.080]  their part of their agenda is that you and i don't talk have you seen how google admits this now they
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:58.560]  look at what your profile is and only keep you in your little group now yeah yeah i noticed that and
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:05.120]  um not to say anything against flavor slave beautiful beautiful spirited guy but when you
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:11.360]  google public enemy player slave comes up and they looked at public enemy through the eyes of vh1
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.920]  and we know who vh1 is connected to we know we know that we know that agenda vh1 is supposed
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:24.320]  to be video hits one but they never play videos so we know what their agenda is well it's it's
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:31.760]  the ruin fan and the food entertainment television bet well i mean i mean if you look at it you watch
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.800]  any tv i don't care what it is it's to destroy families and hurt little kids and screw people up
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:40.640]  because they know if somebody's got their head screwed on they're going to find the truth
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.320]  they're going to stand for the truth we're going to have a good civilization and a future but if
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.080]  they can screw everybody up i want to talk about their super end game why they want to get rid of
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.240]  most of the population so they can have the life extension technology but professor griff and i do
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:59.680]  have that clip of clinton under clear mind control uh when we come back stay with us professor griff's

[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:18.000]  kind of broad okay here is a clip for me a doc british documentary the compilation of
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  politicians movie stars people going into trances and i've actually been around a lot of
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:29.920]  media people and let me tell you i don't know notice the mickey mouse kids all those women
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:33.840]  that end up being the big stars who were in disney and i mean let me tell you there's something to
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.840]  this i mean now they want to drug the aurora reported shooter with truth serum to make him
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.840]  admit he did the murders so now they're going to drug you till you confess when you're under mind
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:48.480]  control those particular drugs put you back in it but but and again i don't have time to get into
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:53.040]  it'll cut into professor griffith but that whole story under darpa control getting darpa money
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.400]  multiple shooters saying he was under mind control putting him back on the drugs all these guys has
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:04.240]  the same mo i there have been cases of one guy uh in like 99 who killed a bunch of people at church
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:09.040]  in fort worth and neighbors said they saw him dragging him out and putting him in a white van
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:13.920]  two days before and he'd been in navy psyops and then i talked to his neighbors and people i mean
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:20.480]  it's it's it's insane but side issue here's that mind control video uh first it's just video of
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.960]  clinton having makeup put on looks like a doll you know totally in a trance and then next is him
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.000]  acting like a three-year-old here it is in covertly recorded off-air transmissions from the bush
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.960]  clinton presidential election campaign in the 1990s we can see that bill clinton was nothing
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:45.280]  more than a puppet to the puppet masters which placed him in the white house bill clinton's
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:52.320]  demeanor seems to be similar to a person who is under a hypnotic trance no definitely
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.040]  this is great i love it
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:07.760]  any more he's not on drugs there he is under mind control that is hypnotism unbelievable
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.040]  good god that's enough of it it just goes on and on professor griff i mean the problem is is that
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:21.360]  you're going to be leaving us not in this segment the next and you say you'll come back in two weeks
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.720]  which we're very honored to have you to just take phone calls and talk to us and we'll see you
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.800]  in two weeks which we're very honored to have you to just take phone calls but once you're gone from
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:32.000]  here i know you'll think oh i wish i would have said that what else do you want to talk about
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:38.560]  today that's important i was just thinking that because i was i was uh i was talking i was saying
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:45.760]  to myself two seconds ago i wonder if i should uh bring up the whole idea of the people that i have
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.120]  in my laptop that that when you mentioned about putting him in office
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:57.520]  i don't think people understand what dynamic of the uh the city states and i don't think
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:03.840]  they understand the right dynamic of grooming these men to be president and then the people
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:10.240]  that are put in place um to put these people in office so i in my lecture i talk about the black
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:16.880]  pope um who's is who's part of part of the society of the jesuit order i talk about the big new
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:25.200]  brudinski george solos um and other people in rupert murdoch and and we go on and on who is
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:32.560]  joe biden and i talk about these things and how obama barack obama barry gave us whatever you
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:38.240]  want to call him today um he's groomed to be the president but he's not the president of the united
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:45.920]  he acts like he's hypnotized at times i mean i mean something's it's that same programming i
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:52.160]  don't think the programming took too well on bush no it didn't i think it backfired and the whole
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:58.800]  double speak and the whole training him on how to use the english language but to to speak to
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:04.320]  only a certain group of people this is this is david rio um stephen jacobson in his book
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:10.720]  on mind control in america he talked about these particular techniques in depth and uh this is
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.120]  something that stephen jacobson laid out that needs to be studied this whole idea of backward
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:19.520]  masking and double speak and these kind of products that they use in and out of the music
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.800]  industry i think it's a very fascinating interesting read and people could say it's all mumbo jumbo
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:28.160]  but we know the globalists are all into the occult the point is they're getting the power
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:32.800]  just incredible professor griffith final segment with him we're back in one minute third hour

[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:37.520]  all right folks i was just talking to the founder of public enemy professor griff the
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:42.880]  information officer and uh maybe we'll get him to austin for an in-studio interview just amazing
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.880]  he'll be back with us in two weeks again to take phone calls man during the breaks you're really
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:51.840]  laying it on me uh you were bringing up some of these celebrities you're saying look i you know
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.400]  i don't want to have a confrontation i'm not trying to be mean nothing against them individually
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:01.520]  to repeat what you said to me uh and i don't even know about all this so i'm not even involved in it
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:06.720]  but i respect you and believe you said listen i had conversations with bam bam bam bam bam living
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.760]  people and then you said and tupac and they told me about what's going on and i've seen other people
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.040]  talk about this stuff what do you think happened with tupac personally speaking my gut feeling is
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:22.160]  the fact that tupac knew too much when he came back out of prison and um some people that i
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:28.640]  could probably mention i probably probably won't get in too much trouble but i invited um jada jada
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:34.000]  pinkett smith will smith's wife laid out money uh sugar knight and a few other people laid out
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.800]  money tupac was free tupac went to california tupac was propositioned by quincy jones dealing with
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:46.560]  this the sexual rituals that go on in these secret societies shortly after that tupac dead
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:56.240]  wow now you now you do the math man this is wow i did not know this was gonna happen today here
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:01.840]  on the air uh man wow so i'm asking questions that's all i'm doing because i'm asking the
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.880]  questions and i'm putting it out there all of a sudden they want to attack me and confront me
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:12.000]  but i'm saying okay i'm going to bring my information here is the information now the
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.480]  conversations i've had with certain individuals that don't want to be revealed i can't tell you
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:21.520]  about that but i can tell you what tupac told me that quincy jones propositioned him all right well
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:27.680]  i did not sure sure sure specifically just you know man i tell you i i mean all i know is every
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:33.280]  time i study any group the french the the chinese the russians the you know what's happening at the
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:39.280]  vatican everywhere it's all the occult and it's what's going on and that's what the illuminati
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:46.400]  is into is these uh sex cult rights uh as you know and that's what the phalluses in dc all of this
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:53.440]  it's just so crazy exactly and and so we shouldn't be fortunate to think that it's not going on
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:59.600]  in an industry like hip-hop and like the music industry that that controls people live but i
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.560]  mean look at lady gaga look at all of it it's rituals on the television i mean they're doing it
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:09.280]  openly and they think they're getting power from it well well is there any way that tupac could
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.760]  have been wrong about what he was telling you there's about no chance that he could have been
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:20.000]  wrong but the events that happened after tupac's death especially with the synonymous letter and
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.800]  making the connection with private prisons to hip-hop and to rap music and the criminalization
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:30.400]  and the nicorization of rap music i think he was right what about dave chappelle he said of stuff
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.120]  like this and then disappeared and then later said it was a joke then said it wasn't i mean
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:41.120]  why did dave chappelle said similar stuff about mafias and things exactly dave chappelle went
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.840]  so far to give back 50 million dollars now what black man you know gonna give back anybody 50
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:53.200]  million dollars and go to africa what are you running from so we need to understand he didn't
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:58.080]  say that when he was on oprah no i i listen i've been told stuff i've been told stuff by some
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:03.920]  pretty big movie stars off record that just it's every it's it's totally insane if people knew who
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:10.560]  ran things just and by the way satanic rituals is the tip of the iceberg exactly and so everyone
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:18.160]  from bob dylan down to damn uh little wayne so they're confession they can't keep it a secret
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:22.640]  too long we know the cat is out of the bag wait even bob dylan i mean he speaks out against the
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.200]  new world order and uh sundown on america but how did he know that back in the 80s
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.800]  their whole new order plan it's it's in the songs wow that was right something was going on then
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:39.920]  that we didn't know about he put in the song some of the songs well i know some folks that know bob
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:44.240]  dylan and they say he's he knows about the new world order that's well i'm not gonna man i tell

[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:59.440]  uh well what do you make of the attack uh i mean i know you talk about all the attacks on liberty
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:06.480]  not just uh vitamins and minerals what is the state of our republic right now oh it's horrendous
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:13.680]  i mean we're looking at uh around 2022 a circumstance in which medical care in this country
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:19.840]  will be very hard to get as far as quality care is concerned and of course with a 16 and a half
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:24.800]  trillion dollar debt and with the 23 trillion by the time obama leaves office it's not far
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:32.160]  before we experience a collapse in the ability of government to supply services the good news about
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:37.200]  that of course is that we may have a chance of restoring a limited federal republic and a
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:43.280]  constitutional system of government we now have a bureaucratic oligarchy ruling this country when
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:49.200]  nine-tenths of all federal law is not the product of those we elect but rather the product of the
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:57.440]  unelected heads of these agencies like the fda we no longer have a republic you're right and
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.760]  we're having more and more of this imperial rule where congress is told hey the u.n and
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:07.440]  nato's over our military hey obama's over the fda and epa is going to shut down the power plants
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:11.520]  obama you know mayor bloomberg he's going to tell you what you can drink and do they're really
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:16.800]  trying to get us used to really stuff that's like dark satire out of a kurt vonnegut novel
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.360]  well that's true there's been a fundamental shift in sovereignty at the time of the founding of the
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:27.040]  republic the core value of the constitution meant to be protected by it was liberty
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:33.120]  an individual liberty and sovereignty was said to be paramount government was to be our servant not
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:39.520]  our master and here we are in the 21st century we're acting like we're in the 16th century we've
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:47.280]  got an environment in which the sovereign is the king or the government and we are the serfs again
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:54.080]  i mean we really are victims of circumstances beyond our control and increasingly every decision
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:17:00.560]  we make no matter how intimate is being affected by a decision made in washington by someone we
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:06.640]  can't affect because they're unelected congress since the 1930s has delegated governing power
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:12.560]  to the administrative agencies there used to be a concept in the law known as the non-delegation
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:18.320]  doctrine and the supreme court in the 1930s struck down many pieces of legislation
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:23.920]  because they violated this doctrine which is consistent with article one of the constitution
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:31.920]  that congress make all law and now it is the case that since the 1930s not a single piece
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.200]  of legislation that has delegated power from congress to the agencies has ever been held
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:42.480]  unconstitutional for violation of this doctrine it's essentially a dead letter that and the
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:49.280]  separation of powers which is gone agencies are both the accuser the the trier and the and the
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:54.640]  prosecutor so when you have an ahead of an agency that says okay let's go get this company let's go
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:02.960]  get this person that agency head will ultimately also decide your fate so you don't have a
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:08.720]  separation of functions essential for liberty and then you see the senate trying to act like that
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:14.640]  as well not calling a hearing but uh we've seen lieberman and others say we should be able to
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:20.640]  send a senate order to youtube to have videos we don't like taken down where they're staffers
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:28.480]  now are judge jury and executioner no due process no uh you know restraint just off with their heads
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:33.520]  take them away to the dungeon where do you see all this going because i see a new poll out today
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:38.560]  most americans see government as threat to their rights for first time trust and establishment
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:42.960]  institutions continues to plummet and the system's answer is to buy two billion bullets
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:48.160]  armored vehicles and put cameras up on every street corner and get citizen spies i mean it
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:54.400]  looks like the system is on a power trip well it is as i explained in restore the republic
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:59.840]  all of the essential checks on the expansion of government have been eroded away to nothing
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:05.840]  all the constitutional checks all of the structural checks inside our government that were
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:13.280]  required by the constitution to restrict government have been eliminated and so you have
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:18.720]  unfunded mandates to the states absorbing the states into this mass federal entity you have
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:25.280]  no separation of powers with all the power that is difficult to wield out of the hands of congress
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:31.440]  and into the agencies by act of congress you have people you elect to office who are virtually
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:37.760]  powerless to affect any change except with a super majority and all of the day-to-day changes
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:43.840]  are taking place by those who really have the control the agents all right stay there attorney

[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:37.920]  that and you can't pack your lunch i mean it's a giant prison america is turning into a prison
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:46.000]  jonathan w uh emord uh you know famous uh lawyer beating uh the fda let's talk about let's bring
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.680]  in dr peter glidden who recommended you to the show and i'd already wanted you on and forgotten
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.360]  about it you know that is you're driving listening to somebody late night you know coast coast am one
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:57.600]  of my favorite shows and i heard you on there a while back a few months ago then forgot about it
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:03.600]  and then dr glidden said you got to get this guy on dr glidden tell us about i mean you know
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:09.520]  tooting this guy's horn so people realize there's folks fighting for us and that we can win tell us
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:15.040]  about the guy we've got on the line right now dr glidden well i can't say enough about jonathan
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:20.080]  emord alex i mean of all of the lawyers in the united states right you know there's the old joke
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.960]  you know what what's uh what do you call 100 lawyers in a bus at the bottom of the ocean a
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:31.120]  good start right everybody hates lawyers but not jonathan emord jonathan emord is the exception
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:37.520]  that proves the rule and he is the guy more than anybody else in the united states who has gone to
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:44.480]  bat for holistic medicine for uh vitamin companies to keep health freedom alive he's one of the main
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:51.440]  speakers at the health freedom expos that are in los angeles and in chicago and emord has done more
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:00.240]  for the pragmatic lawful practice of non-drug medicine in the united states than anybody else
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:06.080]  i'm telling you i knew you're going to love this guy you you you too you and uh jonathan are like
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:12.160]  you know twin sons of different mothers coming at the same uh subject from different angles i
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:17.600]  just really can't say enough about him and and the game is still afoot gentlemen the game is still a
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:22.560]  foot there is so much more that needs to be done here and we have a long segment coming up where
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:26.560]  we can break down the current attacks that's why we've got him on today so people know it's coming
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.800]  down the pike so we can defeat it as we've done in the past but now because we have been defeating
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:35.680]  them with the constitution they're just as the attorney was saying as jonathan was saying just
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:41.600]  bypassing that how do you expect this to play out i mean i know the future is fluid it's up to us but
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.720]  if they're going purely to a dictatorial mode is there anything we can do to stop them now that
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:54.720]  they're setting up an imperial uh federal uh bureaucracy and presidency well my firm is
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:27:01.120]  attacking them at every juncture wherever they take a move to violate the rights of people or
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:06.960]  to create a guild protect one industry over another my firm has been very aggressive in
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:13.120]  filing comments on behalf of clients that are injured by those activities and uh particularly
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:17.920]  in the area of free speech in the past but more so now on the structural regulations i think what's
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:22.720]  going to happen is that they're going to break the back of the private sector thomas jefferson
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:28.560]  referred to government as a parasite and uh in the early days of his administration when government
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:34.880]  really was virtually nothing compared to today he was worried that the seeds of its own destruction
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:40.960]  lay in its ability to sap from the private sector it's like blood and that's what's happening we're
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:48.080]  over taxed and over regulated which is another form of taxation this is largely responsible for
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:55.440]  the enormous difference in in wealth the extreme poverty and extreme wealth the absence of an
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.480]  upwardly mobile middle class is largely due to structural barriers the government puts in place
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.040]  through regulation they just make it too costly for people to open a business and keep it going
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:13.280]  um over time as the debt increases as regulation pours down upon the american people and makes it
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:20.240]  apparent to them that they are having difficulty functioning unemployment rises and continues to
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:27.760]  rise and then what happens ultimately is that the welfare state entitlement programs which are now
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:34.080]  continue to which continue to be so attractive to people will be unaffordable for the government to
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:40.720]  maintain they'll break down doctors won't provide medicare services because they can't afford and
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:44.480]  that's already happening it's doubling the premiums this year my dad is in health care
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:49.600]  management he said my god this is written to wreck america i mean do they know what they're doing
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:56.400]  they assume that the private sector will carry more burden than it actually will but as we
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:03.280]  approach that tipping point when people start realizing gee i can't reliably get medical care
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:10.400]  gee my social security check is simply inadequate to afford even basic sustenance gee all these
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:18.640]  promises government has made to me over the years are simply untrue because they can't be fulfilled
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:24.960]  well at that point of necessity people start turning back to the private sector this is like
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:30.160]  this is like the collapse of the former soviet union well i agree with you stay there the author
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:33.920]  is with us i've got to read his books and i don't know how i didn't know about this guy for the last
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:38.400]  few months and we've also got peter glidden there so so so we'll finish up with where he sees it
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:43.840]  going solutions but also the big current attacks this is key information and i'm going to ask the
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:50.720]  lawyer the attorney about the attacks on our free speech here in austin stay with us we're on the

[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:37.520]  least eight times in big lawsuits in court one of the key guys in there also working with congress
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:41.680]  the few times they've done a good job to block outright bans of vitamins and minerals but he's
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:46.080]  also a big free speech lawyer and i want to talk to him about that dr peter glidden's with us to
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:51.120]  bring up some of the current stuff and where we're going with this but let me raise this to you now
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:55.680]  sir you can't see it you're on video skype with us but we're not sending you video so that we don't
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:01.920]  degrade the quality of your video we found but i handed out and had a street crew that i hired
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:07.520]  hand out 10 000 copies of my info wars march magazine that is about the police state takeover
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:15.520]  and selectively anywhere downtown and i'm showing photos to people right now police gave tickets
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.880]  tickets but but notice they were warning so it made it even more racketeering because
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.000]  it was just all intimidation they said next time you'll be ticketed for real
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  and then arrested for blocking right-of-way which they weren't doing just handing out
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:35.680]  just handing out magazines and so here are the photos we actually were able to get these
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:40.480]  of our street team then south by southwest had shaved head nothing against guys with shaved heads
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:46.240]  but you know big bouncer type guys come over and say get off the streets it's a big corporation
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:51.360]  owned by the chronicle local newspaper big successful film music festival we decide to
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:55.840]  hand out 10 000 magazines just one small part of what we do and i've always heard these stories
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:01.280]  about them and they literally had the police code enforcers and then goons who claim they were with
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:05.360]  them we don't know that's the case come up and the news went down there on saturday and they
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:10.320]  admitted it to them then the police backed off and the code enforcers backed off so my question
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:15.280]  to you is they they're conscious about this you can't feed the homeless we'll arrest you
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:21.680]  homeless can't dig in dumpsters and get apples we'll arrest them uh you you can't you can't hand
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:27.760]  out uh uh magazines then when we fight back okay you can but then they just come right back it's
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:33.520]  a conscious uh always moving against us against basic rights what would you do about something
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:39.600]  like this and why are we seeing things like this across the board sir well i think there's a
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:45.280]  general disregard for rights that comes with the growth of government and the assumption of greater
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.960]  government power it's inevitable and we're at a point now where it's become an epidemic across
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:55.920]  the country but in your case there's an unquestioned right first amendment right to
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:03.920]  distribute which uh is recognized since the turn of the 20th century in supreme court precedent
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:09.760]  and it is there are many cases including johovah's witnesses cases in which the right to distribute
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:15.520]  information is fully protected there's a time place and manner restriction that the courts
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:21.600]  recognize in instances where it would have an effect on obstructing traffic or preventing
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:28.000]  ingress or egress to buildings but if people are in the streets particularly and they're not
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.520]  obstructing traffic they're on the sidewalks and so forth they have an undoubted right to distribute
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:39.840]  pamphlets other literature of any kind provided it's not pornographic or otherwise not protected
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:44.800]  by the first amendment but clearly political views are entitled to the strongest first amendment
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:51.040]  protection supreme court has said and the right to distribute them is fully protected so what
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:55.280]  would you do well i would get an injunction against the local authorities that would preclude
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:01.840]  them from taking those actions to stop the distribution of these publications and they
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.200]  really should be mindful of the fact that that can happen in short order this is a federal question
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:12.560]  you're dealing with the first amendment and they can be enjoined from preventing you from doing it
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:17.520]  and of course i still would do that sure exactly the issue i'm getting at is there's the
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:23.920]  consciousness of that every time they do this they back off and when the media shows up then
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.120]  they come back and do it again and then play stupid and the police i ran into later apologized
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:34.160]  and said we didn't want to follow orders but high up said do this and it was selectively only
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:39.200]  against us because it's basically it's hardcore free speech stuff about everything you and i are
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:44.640]  talking about and also the people that own the south by southwest have a long beef with me
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:50.560]  because they're basically collectivist fake liberal tyrants it's just that how do you respond when
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:56.240]  they like the mafia back off when you stand up to them but as soon as you then leave the field
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.760]  they come back how do you deal with something like that well i think you're doing a wonderful
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:07.440]  job by exposing it as you are right now but in addition i would make clear to the authorities
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:12.000]  what's going on and that it is their duty to protect your right of free speech that's what
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:17.920]  i did yeah and they should be uh signing officers to prevent these people from interfering with your
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:23.040]  right to distribute that literature that's their obligation well that is how it ended what was
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:27.760]  actually us calling the police over or the ladies we hired the local street team uh we had to get
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:33.200]  the cops over to stop those guys so so when the cops and others uh stopped following their little
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:38.400]  orders and then the code enforcers wouldn't fall on constitutional orders then they actually sent
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:46.880]  goons out showing the essence of this well it's uh sounds like an awful situation but uh i think
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.200]  the law is plainly on your side at least in this instance exactly but i think it just shows the
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:58.240]  mindset of chicago or new york style muscling now is even in texas i mean how bad is the tyranny
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:04.960]  growing well it's horrendous uh for example with obama care the promulgation of regulations under
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:09.440]  obama care you thought the statute of over a thousand pages was bad take a look at what's
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:16.480]  coming out of the regulatory agencies particularly hhs and cms and and the rent seeking or uh
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:21.920]  corporate protectionism activity is just running rampant with more lobbying than i've ever seen
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:28.720]  scenes because this is going to create an army of tens of thousands of new bureaucrats and huge
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:36.800]  opportunities for protectionist uh regulation and so for example there's a new regulation out by cms
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:43.440]  that would make registered dieticians the only people in hospitals that can prescribe medical
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:50.000]  nutrition therapy and they can do that independent of physicians under this thing it's a plum that
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.480]  they were able to snatch through lobbying the cms and this will have dire consequences because
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:02.400]  registered dieticians have uh oftentimes just a bachelor's degree that's all that's required
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.040]  in science and a bachelor of science but it creates a monopoly guild as you were saying
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:12.880]  earlier but i mean what about the fact they now admit it does have the death panels right that's
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:18.240]  uh that's an amazing uh horrific aspect of this too and it's going to come to pass it's not going
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:24.080]  to come to pass not only because of the inherent power to allocate resources that they've assumed
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:32.640]  but also because uh we're going to see a shortage of both physicians and of specific uh
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:41.360]  services for example the 2.3 excise tax on medical devices under obamacare is destroying the medical
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:47.520]  device industry that is comprised largely of small and medium-sized companies that cannot afford the
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:54.720]  enormous tax it's on gross receipts not on profits so unbelievable it's it's really ruinous so that's
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:59.760]  more like 10 15 of their profit and most people are operating on a five ten percent profit and the
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:04.000]  bureaucrats just want more more more and we've seen this in hundreds of cases the last two
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  centuries with collectivists they will wreck the society is there anywhere to reverse the cancer
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.560]  i mean they've got payroll taxes on poor people and the poor are now learning they're going to
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:18.480]  be hammered what did they think insurance companies were going to do of course they
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.480]  compel people to buy their product and then the product goes up in price
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:29.520]  well cbo is estimating that medicated ranks are going to grow by about 16 million people in the
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:35.280]  short term and up to 30 million people in the long term when you look at the long-term prospects for
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:40.800]  insurance companies many companies can't afford the requirements that are being placed upon them
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:47.040]  for under obama care and are dropping insurance entirely cbo estimates that that will result in
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.080]  30 million people being uninsured so what do we have a system of obama care that was designed to
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:57.040]  take uninsured people to the tune of some 30 million and give them insurance what it's really
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:04.080]  doing is uh redistributing the right to insurance so that middle-class people who had health
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:07.840]  insurance through their employers are going to lose it to the tune of 30 million people
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.880]  and 30 million people who had who were in poverty stricken are now going to be on the insurance
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:18.640]  rolls uh largely through medicare and medicaid but largely through medicaid and that will bankrupt
[02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:24.640]  the system then they fully nationalize it right and that's really consistent with the overall
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:30.960]  underlying plan here they wanted a single-payer system they built into obama care means to achieve
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:37.040]  that and uh their expectations are coming to pass the exchanges are being rejected by many
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:44.080]  states medicare is expand medicaid is expanding as a result uh and the people are falling off of
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:49.520]  this system are ending up on public systems of support that the federal government is operating
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:53.600]  and that's uh creating the socialized medicine system they wanted after all they really looked
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:43:00.000]  at this uh insurance system as an interim measure the ultimate measure was all along
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.840]  to create socialized medicine in its purest form and by the way there's really not much difference
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:12.080]  between an insurance company bowing to the will of hhs as to coverage and socialized medicine
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:18.880]  anyway we we really do have presently a cancer of socialism that's running throughout the medical
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:25.920]  system and is destroying quality care it's just accelerated to a massive degree with obama care
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:31.680]  and i hear this mindless meme that oh european health care is so great that i watched c-span
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:37.520]  of parliament where they admit it's 18 months to get a brain surgery that's 100 fatal basically if
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:42.400]  you don't get the surgery within six months for a tumor and they just admit it and and then they
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:47.120]  have old people just dying and they're now practicing euthanasia and then bill gates goes
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:52.160]  well that's needed kill grandma hire 10 teachers we're now in this collectivist pot where they're
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:57.360]  going to tell us what to eat insurance companies are getting from the grocery stores what we eat
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:03.040]  to then put it into a database i mean they really know what they're doing i want to bring in dr peter
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:09.520]  glidden uh to to to to comment on this because and they get your take on it uh jonathan because you've
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:15.040]  got the perfect storm here of as they socialize medicine as they bring in death panels as they
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:19.200]  lower quality of care which is what the insurance companies want a government guaranteed to do this
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:23.840]  so they lower care now they can uh you know nix out the doctors and say you don't get that eye
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:28.400]  surgery as daschle wrote in his book you know that's a great thing as all this happens they're
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:34.080]  coming in against the supplements the vitamins the nutrients in the health revolution that can
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:39.200]  keep you out of these hospitals so at the same time and they're trying to shut down the free
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:44.640]  speech of doctors and others who are wanting to expose what's happening so let's bring in
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:49.440]  dr glidden dr glidden uh break down what i was just talking about there give me your take on that
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:54.800]  well here's the way that it is alex you know i could have a thousand patients who had definitively
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:00.880]  diagnosed type 2 diabetes a thousand patients and i could treat them with non-drug therapeutics with
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:05.760]  science-based clinically verified that's science-based clinically verified medical
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:10.800]  nutrition and they could all recover from their diabetic condition no more type 2 diabetes it's
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:17.040]  gone and i can't post that testimonial on a website i can't make a testimonial about that
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:22.480]  i can't make a testimonial about that i can't even say it in public that we can cure the illness
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:26.080]  because according to the food and drug administration the only thing that can cure
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:32.560]  anything is a drug this is a big bad voodoo daddy you know and quite frankly alex i couldn't be
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:38.640]  happier if the medical system collapses because we have taken the wrong dog to the hunt i mean the
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:44.320]  medical system doesn't need to be streamlined the drug companies don't need to be reined in
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:49.360]  there doesn't need to be more checks and balances less regulation or more regulation the reason that
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:55.440]  our health is going to hell in a handbasket is because we've taken the wrong dog to the hunt
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:02.560]  md-directed uh pharmaceutical centrist allopathic reductionistic treatments for chronic disease
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:08.000]  don't work this is the trillion pound gorilla in the middle of the country that nobody is talking
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:15.200]  about the best possible thing that we can do for our health is not to tweak the system not to try
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:21.680]  to perfect the system not to try to streamline the system it's abandoned the system the only thing
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:27.520]  that md-directed medical therapeutics are good for is surgery when surgery is absolutely necessary
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:33.840]  and emergency care medicine but the alternative practitioners the nature past the the homeopaths
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:39.600]  the herbalist the acupuncturist everybody who's not an md has been kicked off of the bus of
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:44.880]  medicine for goodness sake the state of illinois sued me for five thousand dollars because i used
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:50.400]  the word doctor on my website you can't do that now i've been a licensed physician for 20 years
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:55.280]  but it's not okay for me to use the word doctor let's stop right there let's stop right there
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:02.080]  i remember having dr blalock who's a retired brain surgeon but other people on 16 years ago
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:06.640]  saying you're going to see giant increases in diabetes as they put aspartame in thousands
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:12.160]  of products not just soft drinks equal nutra sweet brand names we knew this the studies were
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.120]  there in the 70s when they couldn't get it approved until 80 and here here it is cbs news
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:22.960]  last week new study is wake up call for diet soda drinkers and let's punch this up for tv viewers
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:29.760]  cbs news and it goes over all of it artificial sweeteners tied to obesity type 2 diabetes
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:34.320]  it's an excitotoxin it makes you more hungry and tricks your brain and fries your pancreas
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:39.920]  they knew it they know it's deadly poison diet soda associated with higher type diabetes no
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:44.560]  one's asking why is it up by two three thousand percent why are hispanics dying left and right
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:48.560]  especially because genetically it really targets them because it's wood alcohol we know what that
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:52.880]  does in native americans that's what hispanics are spanish mixed with native americans it's
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:59.280]  killing them in mass but you can't come out and say nobel prize for medicine linus pauling mega
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:05.040]  dosages of vitamin c massively kills cancer is a great treatment you can't say that even though
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:11.440]  it's nobel prize but they can push 10 000 plus products with aspartame in it that kills people
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:21.280]  deader than a hammer 500 million people die from vioxx 500 000 500 000 a half a million people die
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.240]  from vioxx nobody goes to jail the leading cause of death in the united states right now to the
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:31.680]  tune of 780 000 people a year is md directed medical therapeutics it's the leading cause
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:36.400]  of death it's the leading cause of bankruptcy while the mds have been driving the bus of
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:41.840]  medicine autism is skyrocketing alzheimer's is skyrocketing life expectancy is flatlined
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:48.480]  it's unbelievably poor outcomes and nobody bats an eyelash wow going back to jonathan w
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.160]  emord sir you know i've been throwing a lot of questions yeti a lot of points what are some of
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:56.160]  the big attacks we've got on the supplement front going on i mean i know they've been pushing
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:01.600]  that as well because big medicines in there what patenting you know fish oil changing a molecule
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:07.280]  and then they want their competition that's 20 times cheaper banned well one thing that people
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:14.240]  need to really understand is that the censorship regime that the fda operates is profound and
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:20.160]  there it is absolutely prohibited by federal law to make any treatment claim for a dietary
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:26.320]  supplement even if it's true so for example if you put on and that's true of foods as well if
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:34.240]  you put on the label of water treats dehydration you've just transformed the water by operation
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:40.080]  of law into an unapproved drug and it is illegal to sell you sell it you can be thrown in jail you
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:47.920]  put on uh any other thing prune juice you put on there treats chronic constipation you just
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:53.440]  transform the prune juice into a drug and you're thrown in jail that's so even if the statements
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:59.120]  are true if you say cranberries are good for the stones in your bladder or your kidneys you can't
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:06.240]  do it can't do it and the reason why this regime is in place is that it is an anti-competitive
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:12.080]  system that ensures a monopoly on the right to make therapeutic claims for drug companies
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:18.160]  they're the favored regulatee the whole food drug and cosmetic act is designed to put the government
[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:26.160]  in the place of protecting the drug approval process and thereby protecting an exclusionary
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:32.960]  system that limits to drugs the right to make therapeutic claims a drug is not defined as a drug
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:40.080]  based on its chemical composition it's defined as a drug based on the claims that are made that is
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:45.920]  therapeutic claims so anything that makes a therapeutic claim is automatically categorized
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:51.120]  as a drug so it's a pharmaceutical monopoly wow jonathan w emord we're going to come back with

[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:56.560]  his books and then carry him obviously because i'm i heard him on coast to coast blew me away and
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:01.200]  then actually research wow this is the guy that has had so many victories i'm going to continue
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:05.600]  on with dr glenn for at least 30 minutes in the next hour if your local station doesn't carry it
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:11.440]  audio streams at infowars.com and video streams at prisonplanet.tv but in the three or four minutes
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:19.760]  we have left sir why have you been so successful against the fda not epa fda why have you been so
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:24.880]  successful when other people have it because you know i cover the news i know how hard it is
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:29.280]  if you actually have a case and go to court against them the feds have like a 97 percent
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:34.000]  conviction rate just to show how corrupt things are and when you're suing them it's i mean i saw
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:38.880]  human experimentation we exposed and broke here with researchers north carolina where they were
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:44.240]  gassing college students and not telling them just two months ago we broke that and the obama
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:48.880]  administration said we're allowed to do this we're going to stop the program but nobody gets in
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:55.200]  trouble that's nuremberg stuff i mean you know it's amazing so so where is it going
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:07.360]  where is it going yeah well i think on the question about success i think uh the reason
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:14.480]  for the success is entirely one of strategy we were very careful in how we position these cases
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:22.240]  and how we chose to take them we didn't take every case that came along and we we really had
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:30.000]  two things working for us excellent argument and then also a persuasive ability with the judges
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:36.480]  that we had it's it's very hard to win against the federal government i would say that 99 percent
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:41.200]  of all cases involving the federal government the federal government wins these days
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:46.480]  so defeating the an agency as powerful as the food and drug administration does require
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:51.360]  considerable amount of work and sometimes the amount of time for example with pearson versus
[02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:57.680]  chalala which was a landmark decision that held fda censorship of the folic acid neural tube defect
[02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:04.560]  claim and omega-3 fatty acid coronary heart disease claim and other claims unconstitutional
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:11.920]  unconstitutional that case took a decade to build and to present uh through the administrative
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:19.120]  process onto the courts so it's a it's very hard to defeat the abuses that the government
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:26.080]  puts on the american people well i love that uh little life ring you have behind you says

[03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:27.920]  wow i'll tell you we just started getting into the intriguing stuff where he was bringing up
[03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:31.920]  the court cases that was the first question i had written down i wanted to ask him talk about some
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:37.760]  of the cases you won where you know you can't say folic acid has been shown to cut back on
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:42.080]  birth defects and you need it that you know that it's not drugs it's a lot of simple nutrients
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:47.040]  so this is the time we have left um jonathan please break down a few of the other victories
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:51.840]  you've had just so people get an idea of how serious this is because you know i get excited
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:57.280]  about tyranny taking over i get excited about resisting it and i think people need to find that
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:02.160]  instinct again of really being territorial about our liberties that thomas jefferson talked about
[03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:06.160]  but spend a few more minutes i mean not tooting your horn it's been a long time since we've
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:12.480]  talked about these rare victories you've had well i think i might mention uh one that is
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:18.240]  really an example of just how far the government goes and then also once you get the tiger by the
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:24.640]  tail how you can succeed in flipping it and we had we had a client that wanted to say that
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:32.880]  vitamin b6 b12 and folic acid could reduce the risk of vascular disease and that is backed by
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:39.360]  enormous science that combination of vitamins has the effect of lowering a caustic amino acid
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:46.080]  called homocysteine and the cdc had announced uh to the physicians of the united states that
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:53.040]  they ought to test for homocysteine in addition to cholesterol because homocysteine was determined
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:59.920]  by cdc to be an independent risk factor for vascular disease so we presented this petition
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:06.400]  to the fda for approval of the claim showing the evidence and the cdc's position on lowering
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:14.880]  homocysteine and the fda made the extraordinarily arrogant statement common with this agency that
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.840]  it is the the agency of the federal government that will decide what constitutes an independent
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:26.160]  risk factor not cdc that even though cdc made this determination it had no bearing on its own
[03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:31.680]  assessment that it didn't think that homocysteine was an independent risk factor that it didn't
[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:36.480]  think that all this science showing the lowering of homocysteine with these three vitamins
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:43.280]  was necessarily uh proof that it would lower your risk ultimately of vascular disease so it denied
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:51.120]  the claim and that came on the heels of about six victories that we won over them in cases of
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:58.800]  censorship and the courts were very uh willing at that time to strike the agency for failing to
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:04.960]  abide by these orders so we pursued a different strategy in that case with a client willing to
[03:03:04.960 --> 03:03:11.840]  support it where we went after the commissioner of the fda directly and laid a foundation for
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:20.400]  a contempt action where the commissioner could be uh held responsible directly to the
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:27.680]  for violating these court orders these are constitutional mandates and so uh immediately
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:32.240]  after it became clear that that was our direction the government capitulated allowed the very
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:38.080]  claims we had asked for and uh disappeared because they didn't want to be hit well that's what i was
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:43.040]  about to say i'm no superstar lawyer like you but 17 years on air and fighting a lot of corruption
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:48.320]  i'll go after the people who have conflicts of interest i'll go after the people that are getting
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:54.400]  the payoffs i'll go all the way around and then suddenly they leave you alone and and so it really
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:59.760]  just shows uh that there's more than one way to skin a cat that's true you know one thing one
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:07.040]  example i think characterizes the corruption and the control of the drug industry over the fda
[03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:12.880]  perhaps more than any other there are many many instances but in the case of sanivy eventus's
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:20.720]  drug keytech that company was found by the fbi and by the medical reviewers at fda to have come
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:28.960]  up with a fraudulent clinical trial as a principal basis for its drug and despite the fact that the
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:36.160]  fbi prosecuted the investigators who for the sanivy eventus who did the trial and despite the
[03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:41.840]  fact that there was no question that the evidence did not exist of there ever being that the
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:48.640]  clinical trial the fda commissioner overruled the medical reviewers and approved keytech incredible

[03:08:43.280 --> 03:08:47.520]  of ride shotgun but i wanted to go into overdrive today which some stations do carry and some days
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:52.480]  we do live sometimes it's the first hour re-aired for stations that have to miss that uh upon the
[03:08:52.480 --> 03:08:57.760]  different satellite systems we have but you just heard the lawyer that's beaten them eight times
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:05.280]  in court in sometimes decade-long litigations and you heard him criminally about 98 of the times the
[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:12.480]  feds convict it was about 95 of years ago it's like 98 now 99 of the time you heard him you lose
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:18.560]  because it's so rigged the only reason he wins is he'll show the conflict of interest and judge
[03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:24.080]  don't you own a bunch of stock in blah blah blah you know or uh you because it is a bunch of crooks
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:28.720]  up there and i love the fact we got that lawyer on i mean i could have guessed that's how they're
[03:09:28.720 --> 03:09:32.880]  winning because that's pretty much only way you win with these crooks now because they're so busy

[03:09:59.920 --> 03:10:05.840]  there's no law i'll never forget about six seven years ago everyone's cnn to the big pr thing with
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:10.240]  the kids made to take the shots in maryland baltimore they had 2 000 kids and their parents
[03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:14.720]  lined up with barking dogs and swat teams because the right wingers were saying don't take the shots
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:19.280]  and the judge is like it's the law he had him outside gaveling and i had the state attorney
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:24.080]  on who ran it all and i go you know that isn't the law and you tricked him the truancy isn't the law
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.640]  you triggered truancy by kicking him out which you can't do and then charge him with truancy
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:36.960]  plus you couldn't kick him out because it's only policy it's not law and the guy goes you ought to
[03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:42.000]  be a lawyer like me that's right my kids don't take it i ought to find that radio interview

[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:45.360]  and screws everybody around them and doesn't think it's going to come back on them i mean even if
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:51.040]  they're not moral people don't they know that if you go to a city pool and excuse my french crap in
[03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:57.120]  it that pretty soon nobody can get in the pool i mean don't they don't they get that uh sir
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:02.560]  well it's been an experience alex there's basically two types of people in the world
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:06.800]  there are people that are self-centered and there are people that are other centered
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:11.280]  and generally speaking the people like you and the people like me the people that are involved
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:15.840]  with actually helping people right where other people centered and we'd never even consider
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:21.360]  doing that i mean we'd we'd be the ones the first ones through the door to get bloody right helping
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:26.560]  to shake down some type of tyrannical thing helping to stand up for the little guy but there's
[03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:31.440]  a whole contingent of society that they're self-centered and it's just the way that they
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:36.880]  look at things and you know like the fella said he can't fix stupid and this is just the way that
[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:42.240]  it is in the world and by the way jonathan emoord oh my god this is one of the reasons alex i've been
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:47.920]  involved with holistic medicine for over 20 years he's the reason we can have info wars health.com
[03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:55.280]  he's the people don't know it would all be banned right now and this is why i love dr wallach so much
[03:12:55.280 --> 03:13:02.160]  and dr wallach's company young jeopardy by the way emoord didn't tell you yeah he dr wallach
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:07.280]  introduced to jonathan emoord to his current wife for goodness sake because they've gone out of
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.240]  their way dr wallach's got out of his way to sue the food and drug administration on your behalf
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:17.360]  for goodness sake and he's one of wallach's lawsuits yeah he won he won a qualified health
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:23.360]  claim petition around the nutrient selenium which allows us to legally say and i want you to think
[03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:28.720]  long and hard that we had to sue the food and drug administration so that we can say this legally
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:34.240]  one selenium capsule at 200 micrograms a day which is cheaper than dirt for goodness sake
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:40.160]  because it's made from dirt selenium is a mineral supplement like calcium 200 micrograms of selenium
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:46.560]  reduces the occurrence of breast cancer by 82 percent reduces the occurrence of prostate cancer
[03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:55.680]  by 69 colon cancer 64 and lung cancer 39 even if you're a smoker and we had to sue the food and
[03:13:55.680 --> 03:13:59.840]  drug administration it's on record they admit now because the lawsuits were able to say
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:05.200]  what about the big university study on what beyond tangy tangerine and ultimate
[03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:10.560]  the different longevity products here for the colon it kills cancer cells kills cancer cells
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:15.680]  but the only people that can treat cancer in the united states are oncologists the people that
[03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:21.200]  screw it up i want you to think about this long and hard medical doctors bless their hearts are
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:26.160]  not trained in how to cure disease it's not in their wheelhouse for goodness sake they don't
[03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:31.200]  even know how to cure heartburn right they can't cure heartburn they can manage it with a little
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:36.640]  purple pill they can manage it but they can't cure it to the profession that does not even know how
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:42.720]  to cure cancer to cure heartburn we have given a trillion dollars of money to come up with a cure
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:48.480]  for cancer and now they're coming out with cancer vaccines which they admit will actually give some
[03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:54.960]  people cancer it's crazy i mean the chemotherapy and the radiation treatments that they give for
[03:14:54.960 --> 03:15:02.560]  cancer give people cancer chemotherapy from mary taylor moore who had lung cancer beat it but now
[03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:08.320]  the chemo is giving her brain cancer exactly right nobody goes to jail can you imagine what would
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:14.800]  happen if dr glidden or dr wallach or an herbalist or an acupuncturist or a chiropractor or a homeopath
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:19.360]  somewhere in the world gave one patient one herb and it killed them we'd be pilloried in the town
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:25.520]  square but the fda the pharmaceutical companies do it all the time and we give them a pass this is
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:30.880]  how deeply down the rabbit hole we have gone here in this country we have become culturally
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:35.760]  conditioned to believe that when it comes to medicine the md is the executed king and it's
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:40.720]  simply a lie it's not true there's room in the world for mds and you know in a perfect world
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:45.840]  we'd go to see them for emergency medicine and for surgery when surgery is absolutely necessary and
[03:15:45.840 --> 03:15:51.840]  for everything else you'd use longevity because as god is my witness wallach's therapeutics make
[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:57.440]  produce more consistent physiological change produce better results than anything i've ever
[03:15:57.440 --> 03:16:02.160]  seen it is the best kept secret in medicine it's the best thing to happen to medicine since the
[03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:06.480]  sterile technique quite frankly you know what the only way i'm gonna be able to shut up and let you
[03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:10.080]  actually cover all this was to give you the floor you want to host the rest of the hour i know you
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:15.280]  got your own show coming up today at four you want to host the hour yeah i've never done it before
[03:16:15.280 --> 03:16:20.960]  i'll give it a whack i love doing this sometimes in overdrive just throw it over to somebody
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:25.840]  that's real radio there let me cover a few news items we're gonna come back from break and give
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:30.800]  me the last 40 minutes of the show uh but but let me throw a few other news items at you real quick
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:36.480]  i hope people will go to mfallwarshealth.com i hope they will call the number i look i always
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:40.080]  wrote what i believe in you know you'll hear some ads in the network i'm not saying they're good or
[03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:44.240]  bad i just haven't endorsed them i turn stuff down all the time every once in a while i catch ads that
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:47.760]  go through that i don't totally agree with it i get hopping mad like i did yesterday i caught one
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:52.800]  in the magazine but the point is somebody lost their job over it by the way but the point is is
[03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:57.680]  that we really try to do the right thing because that's what i want that's that's the karma i want
[03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:02.960]  reap what you sow i want good mojo not bad mojo and it's not because i'm even superstitious i
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:09.440]  like i am really in to promoting what i believe in and i'm telling you mfallwarshealth.com all
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:14.480]  the longevity products the lowest prices there and the multi-level marketing vehicle is just what
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:18.560]  they used 16 years ago for the computer program to have affiliates and salesmen they don't even
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:23.040]  promote that angle but it's one of the top rated ones in the country you know some of the bad ones
[03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:28.640]  give stuff bad names this is incredible products great things to sell super buzz going on out there
[03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:33.440]  so sign up at mfallwarsteam.com if you want discounts to be a distributor that's the way to
[03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:36.960]  do it and it really is a life-changing event now here's a few other news items we're gonna go to
[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:41.360]  break and come back and throw the rest of the hour to dr dr glidden i'm gonna be gone until tomorrow
[03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:45.760]  or until uh the the nightly news like i'm gonna go shoot a special video for it right now but i
[03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:51.920]  want him to be able to roll with health news what's going on and to tell you about mfallwarshealth.com
[03:17:51.920 --> 03:17:56.720]  and shoot if he wants to we go out the network number and take some calls uh but school calls
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:03.440]  cops on water pistol vows to track down owner using surveillance cam superintendent you can't
[03:18:03.440 --> 03:18:08.160]  take any of that stuff lightly and again if your if your pastry looks like a gun you're arrested
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:13.360]  or kicked out of school now here it is free speech ban reversed in by city of austin when
[03:18:13.360 --> 03:18:17.280]  i told people about this saturday in a video when i learned of it they said it couldn't be true
[03:18:17.280 --> 03:18:23.360]  they said no info wars bumper stickers allowed in parked cars downtown this is some of us we've
[03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:26.400]  even caught on tape which the guys have been encoding getting ready to air we've already
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:32.720]  heard some and and giving people tickets for handing out my magazine but everybody else was
[03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:39.120]  allowed to free speech ban reversed in austin that's up on info wars.com and they actually
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:45.920]  caught the cop riding one of the info war street team uh there's local companies people that hand
[03:18:45.920 --> 03:18:49.920]  out stuff and it turned out they were fans we hired them they were handing out our stuff a team
[03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:54.960]  of five women and one man one man and they literally first said move down the street we
[03:18:54.960 --> 03:18:59.520]  won't ticket you and then okay now we're going to ticket you and then next we're going to arrest you
[03:18:59.520 --> 03:19:04.160]  and then by the time i got there the cops were already refusing to follow the orders of the city
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:09.280]  so they tried to have code enforcers out there who i named on air but for anybody listening on radio
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:15.920]  go to info wars.com and it is the top story because we finally got the photos off the cameras
[03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:22.800]  from the ladies and we've also tweeted those out at real alex jones on twitter go to any article
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:32.320]  page and click on the little twitter icon and follow us there that is right there on the site
[03:19:32.320 --> 03:19:39.840]  so everybody can see what happened with the street crew but as i was saying uh it is absolutely
[03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:43.120]  essential that everybody realized that we stood up for our rights so they backed off
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:48.560]  but the point is they tried to say we couldn't have a bumper sticker on our car i mean that is

[03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:24.000]  network check out my website fireyourmdnow.com that's fireyourmdnow.com now let's continue this
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:29.120]  line of thought that we were talking about with jonathan emord and alex in the last hour
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:34.880]  like the fella said folks you don't know what you don't know right i mean i know that i can't speak
[03:24:34.880 --> 03:24:40.720]  french i know that i know that i can't fly an airplane i know that but there's some stuff that
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:45.840]  is so far outside of my wheelhouse and yours that you know i didn't know i didn't know that and it's
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:54.400]  the same with you that that's just life well i've got to tell you after 20 plus years of boots on
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:25:00.480]  the ground primary care holistic medical work is god is my witness the stuff that you didn't know
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:09.120]  you didn't know concerning your health is either going to kill you or heal you and my job and i'm
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:15.920]  happy to do it is to educate people about the stuff around medicine and health that so far
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:21.040]  outside of their wheelhouse they didn't even know they didn't know that because it's very very very
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:27.040]  important like the fella said you know if you're lost in the wilderness you go to a survival school
[03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:30.720]  what's the first thing they're going to tell you you're lost in the wilderness what do you need
[03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:36.720]  perspective you got to climb to a high tree climb to a high hill get perspective on where you're at
[03:25:36.720 --> 03:25:42.160]  to try to plot your course out of there well we desperately need perspective when it comes to our
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:48.160]  health and our well-being and well-being and we don't have any in this country we do not for the
[03:25:48.160 --> 03:25:53.200]  last 100 years the medical theater in the united states has been completely dominated and
[03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:59.440]  monopolized by the mds now i'm not md bashing i'm not i have a lot of friends who are mds
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:05.040]  and i have respect for the md medical profession but the md medical profession is just one piece
[03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:10.240]  of the pie of medical science but the drug companies and the insurance companies and the
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:18.320]  illuminati and the powers that be who own the world have convinced you for the last 100 years
[03:26:18.880 --> 03:26:24.000]  that the only person to pay any attention to when it comes to anything medical is the md
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:28.400]  and that everybody else is a back-of-the-bus alternative quack right that's the party line
[03:26:28.400 --> 03:26:34.400]  right oh don't see that chiropractor heaven forbid oh no don't go to see the nature path
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:39.280]  oh don't take those vitamins you're going to get sick and die right well it's nonsense
[03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:46.800]  perspective shows us that met the medicine that mds practice is just one small piece of the greater
[03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:52.800]  pie of medical science and the piece of the pie that mds are trained in is referred to as
[03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:58.800]  allopathic medicine mds don't practice medicine nobody does i don't practice medicine i practice
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:04.400]  naturopathic medicine right there's osteopathic medicine homeopathic medicine chiropractic
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:10.880]  medicine acupuncture ayurveda traditional chinese medicine and what mds do which is referred to as
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:17.280]  allopathic now look republicans have their own philosophical view democrats have their own
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:22.080]  philosophical view libertarians have their own philosophical view buddhists have their own
[03:27:22.080 --> 03:27:27.840]  philosophical view born again christians have their own philosophical view somebody's philosophy
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:31.560]  informs how they move through the world. The philosophy of
[03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:36.120]  healing that MDs are trained in, is referred to as reductionism.
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:43.960]  And reductionism argues that the human body is a soup, a machine
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:48.040]  made of parts. And that it is the doctor's job and the human
[03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:51.640]  body has no inherent healing capacity. Once you're sick,
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.520]  you're screwed according to the MD. And it's the doctor's job
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:59.640]  once you're sick to march in and deliver to your body, man made
[03:27:59.640 --> 03:28:03.480]  synthetic drugs, the intention of which is to suppress and
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:08.800]  manage your symptoms. This is MD allopathic philosophy. Your body
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:12.200]  is a machine, there is no inherent soul force present in
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:15.560]  your body. Why? Because nobody's ever dissected the soul out of
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:17.960]  the corpse. If nobody's ever dissected the soul out of the
[03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:20.880]  corpse, therefore doesn't exist. Because according to
[03:28:20.880 --> 03:28:23.440]  reductionistic medical philosophy, if you cannot
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:27.320]  measure it, it doesn't exist. So according to the MD, your
[03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:31.520]  consciousness is a function of biochemistry. And your body has
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:34.440]  no innate ability to fix itself. And once you're sick, you're
[03:28:34.440 --> 03:28:38.160]  screwed. And so your only option when you're suffering with an
[03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:43.600]  illness is to let the MD the allopathic drug centrist MD
[03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:47.120]  delivered to your body medicines which suppress your symptoms,
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:52.800]  override and control the workings of the human body. Now,
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:58.520]  I want to talk about this, what political system believes that
[03:28:58.520 --> 03:29:01.120]  the people are not smart enough to take care of themselves, that
[03:29:01.120 --> 03:29:04.160]  every aspect of society must be controlled by the state
[03:29:04.680 --> 03:29:08.080]  communists, right? And you know, you can argue we're going that
[03:29:08.080 --> 03:29:11.640]  way here in the United States, but communist regimes, their
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:15.240]  whole thing is people are not smart enough to take care of the
[03:29:15.240 --> 03:29:18.640]  state to take care of themselves, the government knows
[03:29:18.640 --> 03:29:22.280]  best. You know, it's the nanny state, the government has to do
[03:29:22.280 --> 03:29:26.000]  everything for you. Well, this is the MDs philosophy of healing.
[03:29:26.640 --> 03:29:29.720]  Your body doesn't know how to fix itself. The only person that
[03:29:29.720 --> 03:29:32.960]  can is your medical doctor by suppressing and managing your
[03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:35.720]  symptoms with drugs. I'm going to tell you the other side to

[03:32:00.120 --> 03:32:02.600]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid
[03:32:02.600 --> 03:32:05.440]  gland? Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes
[03:32:05.440 --> 03:32:08.480]  off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your
[03:32:08.480 --> 03:32:11.600]  body. Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells
[03:32:11.600 --> 03:32:14.200]  from functioning normally. Animal studies show that mercury
[03:32:14.200 --> 03:32:18.200]  causes kidney function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited into
[03:32:18.200 --> 03:32:20.760]  your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in
[03:32:20.760 --> 03:32:23.440]  function. The number one method by which your body detoxifies
[03:32:23.440 --> 03:32:25.920]  itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one
[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:29.640]  superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your body
[03:32:29.640 --> 03:32:32.960]  to produce glutathione is non denatured whey protein from
[03:32:32.960 --> 03:32:36.440]  grass fed cows. After investigating most high end
[03:32:36.480 --> 03:32:39.920]  whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non denatured
[03:32:39.960 --> 03:32:42.760]  the most active the most complete and in our opinion, the
[03:32:42.760 --> 03:32:46.160]  most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh

[03:33:57.800 --> 03:34:01.520]  people are destroyed by lack of knowledge lack of knowledge,
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:05.840]  right? I mean, before we knew how to purify water, we didn't
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:09.360]  have long life expectancies before we knew how to eliminate
[03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:12.960]  our sewage, we didn't have long life expectancies. Before we
[03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:16.120]  knew how to shelter ourselves from the elements and heat our
[03:34:16.120 --> 03:34:19.280]  homes and cool our homes, we had relatively short life
[03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:22.800]  expectancies, right? These are things that we've all had to do
[03:34:22.840 --> 03:34:26.120]  in order to just survive on planet Earth. We got to find
[03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:29.560]  water and purify it, we have to eliminate our waste responsibly.
[03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:33.120]  We have to shelter our our bodies live in houses and heat
[03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:35.120]  them and cool them. Well, there's one more thing we need
[03:34:35.120 --> 03:34:38.960]  to do that your medical doctor failed to tell you in order for
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:43.200]  your body to maintain and to regain and maintain optimal
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:48.240]  health. Your body needs 90 essential nutrients 90 essential
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:53.280]  nutrients, 60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids and two
[03:34:53.280 --> 03:34:59.320]  essential fatty acids. The only problem is unless the 90
[03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:03.040]  essential nutrients are not present in the food, they're
[03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:07.200]  just not the lion's share of our body's nutrient needs the stuff
[03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:10.280]  that your body needs to keep its heart healthy, keep its joints
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:12.560]  healthy, keep its kidney healthy, keep its gallbladder
[03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:15.600]  healthy, keep its skin and brain and everything healthy. Our
[03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:20.440]  minerals 60 of the 90 essential nutrients are minerals. That's
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:24.960]  two thirds that 66% of your body's nutrient needs are
[03:35:24.960 --> 03:35:28.360]  minerals things like calcium and selenium and sulfur and zinc.
[03:35:28.680 --> 03:35:32.400]  The only problem with minerals is the only person that can make
[03:35:32.400 --> 03:35:36.680]  minerals is God. Plants can't make minerals. Animals can't
[03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:40.000]  make minerals for goodness sake. If plants could make minerals,
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:44.320]  we could bio engineer lettuce to make gold and we'd all be rich.
[03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:47.680]  Minerals are only found in the soils. They're they're found in
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:50.680]  the water table also, but that's because they've washed there
[03:35:50.680 --> 03:35:55.680]  from the soil right minerals come from rocks. Erosion grinds
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:58.120]  down the rocks and then the minerals are in the soil. The
[03:35:58.120 --> 03:36:00.880]  only problem is the minerals are not evenly distributed in the
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:04.320]  soil. They're spread out in veins, you know, like the
[03:36:04.320 --> 03:36:07.320]  chocolate and chocolate ripple ice cream. There's nowhere on
[03:36:07.320 --> 03:36:10.680]  God's green earth where all 60 minerals exist in the soil and
[03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:14.480]  farmers aren't paid to mineralize the soil, especially not in the
[03:36:14.480 --> 03:36:17.560]  industrial agriculture world that we live in. Thank you very
[03:36:17.560 --> 03:36:23.360]  much Monsanto. I don't think so. The 90 essential nutrients that
[03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:27.040]  your body needs simply to maintain its function are no
[03:36:27.200 --> 03:36:31.440]  longer present in the food that you're eating, period. They're
[03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:36.320]  not there. So that means unless you are actively supplementing
[03:36:36.320 --> 03:36:39.120]  your diet with vitamin and mineral and nutritional
[03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:42.720]  supplements, unless you were doing this, it's only a matter
[03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:46.120]  of time until something in your body breaks until something
[03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:50.120]  wears out until something goes south. And then you have a
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:52.400]  health concern you have a chronic disease, you've got
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:55.480]  asthma, you've got type two diabetes, you've got high blood
[03:36:55.480 --> 03:36:57.960]  pressure, you've got congestive heart failure, you have
[03:36:57.960 --> 03:37:03.160]  fibromyalgia, you're infertile, your children have down syndrome
[03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:07.200]  or autism, you have insomnia or fibromyalgia or eczema or
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:12.240]  eczema or whatever, you're in the weeds. So what do you do?
[03:37:12.520 --> 03:37:15.720]  Well, you go to the only medicine that's practiced in
[03:37:15.720 --> 03:37:19.480]  your town, you go to the only medicine that's legal in your
[03:37:19.480 --> 03:37:22.720]  state, you go to the only medicine that your insurance
[03:37:22.720 --> 03:37:26.360]  pays for that's MD directed medicine. The MDs and the
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:30.760]  pharmaceutical companies have a lock on medical practice in the
[03:37:30.760 --> 03:37:33.960]  United States, we don't have a free medical market here. We do
[03:37:33.960 --> 03:37:37.720]  not have a free medical market. My profession naturopathic
[03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:41.160]  medicine is only licensed and regulated in 16 states. And the
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:45.080]  stuff that I know, Big Pharma does not want you to know,
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:49.160]  period. For goodness sake, your body needs 90 essential
[03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:51.440]  nutrients. All right, you didn't have them. So now something
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:55.400]  breaks. And let's say you've got asthma. So you go to your MD and
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:37:59.880]  he throws a drug at it. Now from our point of view, asthma has
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:03.120]  its roots in nutrient deficiency, the deficiency of
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:06.960]  essential fatty acids, Omega three, six and nine, Omega three,
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:10.600]  six and nine. You don't have asthma or chronic disease
[03:38:10.600 --> 03:38:14.840]  because you have a bad gene. You don't have a chronic disease
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:18.240]  because you have a voodoo curse. You have a chronic disease
[03:38:18.240 --> 03:38:22.080]  because you have the wrong doctor. Your body has simply run
[03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:25.200]  out of the nutrients necessary to maintain and regulate its
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:29.480]  health. It's that simple. For goodness sake, if your car runs
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:32.920]  out of oil, what happens? The engine seizes, right? Does that
[03:38:32.920 --> 03:38:35.080]  mean there was anything inherently wrong with the
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:39.840]  mechanics of the engine? No, you just ran out of oil. You run out
[03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:42.480]  of transmission fluid, the transmission seizes. You run out
[03:38:42.480 --> 03:38:45.600]  of power steering fluid, you can't turn the wheel. You run
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:49.280]  out of air in the tires. Well, forget it. And it's no different
[03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:53.120]  with the human body. The biggest problem that we have here in the
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:55.760]  United States, though, is because medicine has been
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:58.360]  monopolized by the pharmaceutical industry and the
[03:38:58.360 --> 03:39:04.760]  MDs for the last 100 years. Your medical doctor has no training
[03:39:04.760 --> 03:39:08.760]  in nutrition, no respect for nutrition, no appreciation for
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:11.880]  nutrition, and certainly no clinical experience with medical
[03:39:11.880 --> 03:39:14.840]  nutrition. Your medical doctor, bless his heart, is trained in
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:18.200]  drugs and surgery. Now, drugs and surgery are great if you
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:21.240]  have a bullet in your arm, if you have a bad tooth, if you get
[03:39:21.240 --> 03:39:23.720]  your leg blown off, heaven forbid in Iraq, if you have a
[03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:27.560]  third degree burn, if you have some type of trauma, that's the
[03:39:27.560 --> 03:39:31.240]  wheelhouse of the MD. That's the domain of the MD. That's what
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:35.000]  they are excellent at. For goodness sake, if you were
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:38.040]  wounded in Vietnam, you had something like a 17% chance of
[03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:41.480]  survival. If you're wounded on the battlefield today, over 80%
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:43.880]  of our soldiers are going to come home because that's the
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:48.360]  domain of MD directed allopathic reductionistic medicine. But
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:51.880]  where they stink is everything else. Everything that you go to
[03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:55.720]  the doctor for, obesity. You want to know the solution to
[03:39:55.720 --> 03:40:00.760]  obesity that not even Oprah knows? Here it is. Your body has
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:05.480]  wisdom. This is the fundamental difference in the philosophies
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:09.240]  of holistic medicine, which is what myself and my colleagues
[03:40:09.240 --> 03:40:12.120]  are trained in, and the philosophy of reductionistic
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:15.800]  medicine that your MD is trained in. The MD believes that your
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:19.960]  body is a coincidental combination of biochemicals that
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:23.720]  happened back in dinosaur days, and that was excited by a
[03:40:23.720 --> 03:40:26.760]  thunderbolt from a passing thundercloud. You've got to be
[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:30.760]  kidding me. According to the MD, there is no inherent vital
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:34.200]  force. There is no inherent soul force in the human body. Once
[03:40:34.200 --> 03:40:37.720]  you're sick, you're screwed. Your body cannot fix itself.
[03:40:38.360 --> 03:40:41.320]  It's the doctor's job to manage things with drugs until they
[03:40:41.320 --> 03:40:45.000]  get so bad that you have to march in and get a new knee. And
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.480]  then three years later, when that knee fails, you get a
[03:40:47.480 --> 03:40:51.000]  refund? No, you get another knee for goodness sake, if you can
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:58.120]  afford it. For goodness sake, obesity is caused by the wisdom
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:01.640]  of your body, the wisdom of your body. And here's what I mean by
[03:41:01.640 --> 03:41:05.240]  that weight gain, obesity, obesity is weight gain on
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:11.480]  steroids. Your body knows how to fix itself. Your body wants to
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:15.480]  fix itself. For goodness sake, your body was so smart. It grew
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:19.960]  itself all by itself from a single celled organism into you.
[03:41:19.960 --> 03:41:22.600]  You think if it could do that it can fix itself? Well, you're
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:26.680]  darn right, it can fix itself. It also knows how to regulate
[03:41:26.680 --> 03:41:30.920]  its affairs. So your body knows that it has the need for
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:34.280]  nutrients. It knows it needs calcium and zinc and sulfur and
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:38.200]  vitamin A and vitamin B and vitamin C. It knows it needs the
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:43.240]  90 essential nutrients. It knows it. But because the nutrients
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:48.600]  are not in the food that we eat, your body is running out of
[03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:53.000]  nutrients. Now, after a time, your nutritional tank gets so
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:57.320]  low that your intelligence of your body freaks out. Your body
[03:41:57.320 --> 03:42:00.280]  knows that if you continue to run on nutrient fumes, your
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:03.080]  heart's going to break. Your gallbladder is going to break,
[03:42:03.080 --> 03:42:05.320]  your joints are going to break, your brain's going to break,
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:10.520]  something's going to break. So your body freaks out and forces
[03:42:10.520 --> 03:42:16.360]  you to eat. Your body forces you to eat in the desperate
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:20.040]  attempt to fill its nutritional tank up. But holy smokes, the
[03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:23.960]  food that you're eating doesn't have the nutrients you need. So
[03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:28.360]  you go to Olive Garden, you eat 3000 calories. Two hours later,
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:31.560]  you're hungry again. So you eat, you eat, you can't stop eating
[03:42:31.560 --> 03:42:34.520]  and then you go to your medical doctor, you're 150 pounds
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:37.720]  overweight and they tell you you're lazy. Even though a
[03:42:37.720 --> 03:42:40.200]  United Nations study done a couple of years ago showed
[03:42:40.200 --> 03:42:47.640]  there's no relationship between exercise and weight gain. It has
[03:42:47.640 --> 03:42:50.680]  nothing to do with it. It has nothing to do with it. Your
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:53.800]  medical doctor tell you, oh, you need to have your stomach cut
[03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:56.280]  out. That's your problem. Your stomach's too big. We need to do
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:43:00.600]  a gastric bypass. Oh, you have the fat gene. That's your
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:05.240]  problem. It's nonsense. Again, because your medical doctor
[03:43:05.240 --> 03:43:08.120]  blesses hard as a colorblind art critic. He does not know what
[03:43:08.120 --> 03:43:11.560]  we know. Your medical doctor has no understanding and no
[03:43:11.560 --> 03:43:14.680]  appreciation for medical nutrition. The only thing that
[03:43:14.680 --> 03:43:18.600]  makes people gain weight is that we eat too many calories.
[03:43:19.160 --> 03:43:21.800]  But was there anybody in the death camps of World War II that
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:25.240]  was overweight? Anybody? I don't care what their pre-existing
[03:43:25.240 --> 03:43:28.280]  medical condition was. I don't care what their age or their
[03:43:28.280 --> 03:43:33.560]  sex or their race was. When you don't eat, you lose weight. The
[03:43:33.560 --> 03:43:37.560]  only thing that makes people gain weight is we eat too many
[03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:42.040]  calories, period. The only thing that makes you eat too many
[03:43:42.040 --> 03:43:45.640]  calories is the wisdom of your body. Your body knows it's
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:49.960]  running on nutrient fumes. So your body forces you to eat in
[03:43:49.960 --> 03:43:52.360]  the desperate attempt to fill that tank up, but the food that
[03:43:52.360 --> 03:43:55.480]  you're eating doesn't have what you need. It just doesn't. So
[03:43:55.480 --> 03:43:58.440]  you eat and you eat and you eat and you eat and then you eat
[03:43:58.440 --> 03:44:02.280]  some more and you never feel full. And then your medical
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:05.080]  doctor tells you your stomach's too big. You've got to be
[03:44:05.080 --> 03:44:10.920]  careful. This is a tragedy of biblical proportions. No pun
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:14.840]  intended. Now you want to know how to fix this? Well, it's
[03:44:14.840 --> 03:44:18.520]  easy. So in order to get on the other side of obesity, the other
[03:44:18.520 --> 03:44:21.560]  side of weight gain, you need to support and promote the
[03:44:21.560 --> 03:44:24.040]  nutritional status of your body. That's all that you need to
[03:44:24.040 --> 03:44:27.640]  do. You need to fill your body's nutritional tank up to the
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:32.760]  brim. Fill it to the brim with the 90 essential nutrients. Now,
[03:44:32.760 --> 03:44:36.360]  not all vitamin supplements are created equal. Vitamins are
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:39.800]  like wine. There's a great deal of difference between Annie
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:43.640]  Boonsprings, green apple wine and a nice, you know, California
[03:44:43.640 --> 03:44:46.680]  Cabernet. Well, they're all made from grapes. What's the
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:50.120]  difference? The recipe is the difference. I've been involved
[03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:52.760]  with naturopathic medicine, the clinical application of
[03:44:52.760 --> 03:44:56.120]  naturopathic medicine as a primary care naturopathic
[03:44:56.120 --> 03:45:00.520]  physician for over 20 years. And as God is my witness, the
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:03.400]  recipes of the vitamin supplements offered by the
[03:45:03.400 --> 03:45:07.640]  Younggeviti Company, formulated by Dr. Wallach, eclipse anything
[03:45:07.640 --> 03:45:11.560]  else in efficacy that I have ever seen. Dr. Wallach's
[03:45:11.560 --> 03:45:15.560]  nutritional supplements produce more consistent results than any
[03:45:15.560 --> 03:45:18.520]  other nutritional supplements. Why? Because their recipe is
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:22.440]  better. It's that simple. Yeah, well, you're going to spend
[03:45:22.440 --> 03:45:24.680]  hard-earned money on vitamins. You got to buy them somewhere.
[03:45:24.680 --> 03:45:26.840]  You might as well get the best ones in the world. For goodness
[03:45:26.840 --> 03:45:30.040]  sake, if your kid wanted to be coached in basketball, you're
[03:45:30.040 --> 03:45:33.080]  going to be coached in basketball and you had the
[03:45:33.080 --> 03:45:36.360]  option to get him coached by Michael Jordan or by your high
[03:45:36.360 --> 03:45:39.880]  school basketball coach for the same amount of money. You'd go
[03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:44.200]  with Jordan, right? Why? Because he's the best. If Albert
[03:45:44.200 --> 03:45:46.600]  Einstein was still alive and your son wanted to learn
[03:45:46.600 --> 03:45:49.800]  science and you could hire Albert Einstein as a tutor or
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:52.440]  your high school science teacher, who would you hire? You
[03:45:52.440 --> 03:45:57.480]  would hire Einstein. Well, if you want advice with nutritional
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:45:59.640]  supplements, quite frankly, you're a knucklehead. If you
[03:45:59.640 --> 03:46:04.360]  want to know more about my Forgettable Science,
[03:46:04.360 --> 03:46:07.640]  Dr. Wallach's clinical experience and Dr. Wallach's
[03:46:07.640 --> 03:46:12.040]  research resume. Dr. Wallach's knowledge base about science
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:16.200]  based clinically verified non-drug treatments that
[03:46:16.200 --> 03:46:19.800]  eclipses anybody else. Dr. Wallach is the Michael Jordan,
[03:46:19.800 --> 03:46:24.120]  the Wayne Gretzky, the Albert Einstein of holistic medicine.
[03:46:24.120 --> 03:46:29.160]  His stuff works better than anything I've ever seen. So
[03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:33.540]  nutrients in one package. It's called the Healthy Start Pack. It's available here
[03:46:33.540 --> 03:46:39.620]  at InfowarsHealth.com. It's called the Alex Pack. InfowarsHealth.com. The
[03:46:39.620 --> 03:46:46.260]  recommendation is one Alex Pack per 100 pounds of body weight per month. If you
[03:46:46.260 --> 03:46:51.260]  take one Alex Pack, one Healthy Start Pack per 100 pounds of body weight per
[03:46:51.260 --> 03:46:56.020]  month into your body, into you add that to your diet every day, it's a game
[03:46:56.020 --> 03:47:02.580]  changer. Because when you do that, guess what happens? It's the first time in your
[03:47:02.580 --> 03:47:09.180]  life your body has been nutritionally satisfied. The first time. Switches start
[03:47:09.180 --> 03:47:13.460]  turning on in your brain that have been turned off for decades. If you're
[03:47:13.460 --> 03:47:16.980]  struggling with weight gain, you take the 90 essential nutrients every day and all
[03:47:16.980 --> 03:47:22.060]  of a sudden you go to Olive Garden. There's 3,000 calories on your plate. You
[03:47:22.060 --> 03:47:27.980]  eat 800 and you're full. You take the rest home in a doggy bag. It's as simple
[03:47:27.980 --> 03:47:33.660]  as that, ladies and gentlemen. Give your body the raw materials necessary to fix
[03:47:33.660 --> 03:47:39.100]  itself. Get out of the way and let the body fix itself. You have no idea what
[03:47:39.100 --> 03:47:43.780]  you're missing. By the way, this isn't old-fashioned medical nutrition. This is
[03:47:43.780 --> 03:47:50.660]  new-fashioned, science-based, clinically verified stuff delivered by holistic
[03:47:50.660 --> 03:47:57.500]  physicians who are licensed and trained in how to do this. As God is my witness,
[03:47:57.500 --> 03:48:01.220]  this is the best-kept secret in the wonderful world of medicine. It really
[03:48:01.220 --> 03:48:06.180]  is. Our basic premise here is your body knows how to fix itself and your body
[03:48:06.180 --> 03:48:10.540]  wants to fix itself. And that most chronic diseases have their roots in
[03:48:10.540 --> 03:48:15.540]  nutrient deficiencies. Did you know that there are over 275 illnesses caused by
[03:48:15.540 --> 03:48:18.780]  not enough calcium? High blood pressure is one of them.
[03:48:18.780 --> 03:48:23.100]  Menstrual cramps, bad menstrual cramps, that's often a calcium deficiency.
[03:48:23.100 --> 03:48:28.860]  Inability to fall asleep at night is a calcium deficiency most of the time. It has
[03:48:28.860 --> 03:48:32.780]  its roots in a calcium deficiency. High blood pressure has its roots in a
[03:48:32.780 --> 03:48:37.340]  calcium deficiency. Muscle ticks and twitches have their roots in calcium
[03:48:37.340 --> 03:48:42.180]  deficiencies. Ringing in the ears has its roots in a calcium deficiency. You don't
[03:48:42.180 --> 03:48:47.420]  have a bad gene. You don't have a voodoo curse. You have the wrong doctor. You've
[03:48:47.420 --> 03:48:51.580]  taken the wrong dog to the hunt. Why? Because your medical doctor and your
[03:48:51.580 --> 03:48:54.660]  insurance company and your pharmaceutical companies have told you
[03:48:54.660 --> 03:48:58.820]  that I'm a quack and that I should be avoided. Oh, don't go to those nature
[03:48:58.820 --> 03:49:05.620]  paths. Irony of ironies. Leading cause of death in the United States, MD directed
[03:49:05.620 --> 03:49:08.940]  medical therapeutics. Leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States,
[03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:15.100]  MD directed medical therapeutics. You want to change your life? You want to get
[03:49:15.100 --> 03:49:18.900]  on the other side of health? You want to support and promote your body's ability
[03:49:18.900 --> 03:49:23.220]  to fix itself with science-based clinically verified stuff that you can
[03:49:23.220 --> 03:49:30.940]  get at the wholesale price? And in so doing, support Infowars and the mission?
[03:49:30.940 --> 03:49:35.340]  Well, this is the best day of your life. Go to InfowarsHealth.com. That's
[03:49:35.340 --> 03:49:44.860]  InfowarsHealth.com. Or call 888-789-9277. That's 888-789-9277.
[03:49:44.860 --> 03:49:48.300]  Talk to someone there. They will hook you up with the Alex Pack, with the
[03:49:48.300 --> 03:49:52.900]  Healthy Start Pack. That's a good place to start. Now, there's two things that
[03:49:52.900 --> 03:49:57.580]  we recommend people do in order to support and promote the health of their
[03:49:57.580 --> 03:50:01.260]  bodies. Number one, fill your tank up with the 90 essential nutrients every
[03:50:01.260 --> 03:50:06.380]  day. Fill it up with the Alex Pack, number one. Number two, eliminate from
[03:50:06.380 --> 03:50:13.180]  your diet 10 foods that we have determined as bad for you. Bad dog, no
