[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27.680 --> 00:32.440]  The United States has come out and publicly admitted that they did attack drills yesterday
[00:32.440 --> 00:37.600]  practicing dropping nuclear weapons on the DMZ.
[00:37.600 --> 00:41.680]  That is the official headlines here.
[00:41.680 --> 00:45.800]  The left all over the place is now publicly celebrating the death and destruction.
[00:45.800 --> 00:47.520]  Houston saying good.
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.080]  You're all white supremacists in Houston even though it is the most diverse city arguably
[00:52.080 --> 00:53.080]  in the United States.
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.400]  Even though it's a great example of people coming together truly sickening, now even
[00:57.400 --> 01:03.040]  Nancy Pelosi came out and more strongly criticized the Antifa and said they are equivalent to
[01:03.040 --> 01:05.120]  the Nazi groups.
[01:05.120 --> 01:10.240]  And Joe Scarborough has come out and said that Antifa is fascist.
[01:10.240 --> 01:11.440]  It blew up in their face.
[01:11.440 --> 01:12.680]  They are collapsing.
[01:12.680 --> 01:13.680]  Trump's been proven right.
[01:13.680 --> 01:15.880]  Here's a key report by John Bown.
[01:15.880 --> 01:17.280]  And so it goes.
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.160]  When disaster occurs, criminals find an opportunity to ply their nefarious trade.
[01:23.160 --> 01:29.600]  Houston police chief Art Acevedo says he has arrested 14 looters since Sunday who face
[01:29.600 --> 01:35.640]  five years to life for preying on the victims of Hurricane Harvey while online fishing scams
[01:35.640 --> 01:38.520]  robbed the charities intended for the victims.
[01:38.520 --> 01:44.440]  Price gouging at gas stations and hotels has been rampant and worst of all, fake firefighters
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.480]  and fake homeland security agents are committing acts of armed robbery on the vulnerable.
[01:50.480 --> 01:56.080]  Meanwhile, arrogant wannabe mainstream media sycophants sell the American public on the
[01:56.080 --> 02:02.360]  blatant untrue fantasy that our duly elected president has fumbled this major crisis.
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.200]  You think the president's language missed the mark emotionally and tonally.
[02:06.200 --> 02:11.360]  If you think the president was undignified, then you might also want to think about what
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.320]  the president was wearing.
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.720]  That hat is for sale.
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.640]  Tonight, the Washington Post puts it this way in its headline, even in visiting Hurricane
[02:21.640 --> 02:27.560]  Ravage, Texas, Trump keeps the focus on himself and Politico wrote, it was a presidential
[02:27.560 --> 02:32.480]  trip to a deluge state where the president didn't meet a single storm victim, see an
[02:32.480 --> 02:35.840]  inch of rain or get near a flooded street.
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.200]  When it comes to the president's conduct, Lawrence, I had the opportunity to travel
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.400]  with President Obama on numerous occasions, unfortunately, to communities across this
[02:43.400 --> 02:46.840]  country that had sustained significant damage from a storm.
[02:46.840 --> 02:49.040]  That trip was not about Barack Obama.
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.200]  The third thing that presidents usually do and human beings do is just have some kind
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.960]  of human empathy and warmth with people who have lost everything.
[02:57.960 --> 03:02.640]  And the fact that Donald Trump didn't even try either of these latter two things to speak
[03:02.640 --> 03:03.640]  for the country.
[03:03.640 --> 03:05.200]  Obama didn't even visit the hurricane last year.
[03:05.200 --> 03:10.480]  There is something unusual about him as a person that I think we saw today.
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.240]  But in reality, it's never been organized by a president better, according to all of
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.280]  the rescue services involved.
[03:17.280 --> 03:23.360]  I got to tell you, I give FEMA a grade of A plus all the way from the president down
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.880]  as I've spoken to the president several times to his captain members, such as Secretary
[03:28.880 --> 03:34.080]  of Homeland Security, such as the administrator FEMA, such as Tom Price, the Secretary of
[03:34.080 --> 03:36.000]  Health and Human Services.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.840]  And so, all across the board, from the White House to the federal administration to FEMA.
[03:41.840 --> 03:52.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this just broke from the un-American enemy of the country, CNN.
[03:52.880 --> 03:55.240]  They're saying Houston got hit because of global warming.
[03:55.240 --> 03:56.800]  We've had record low hurricanes.
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.760]  Houston's always been hit by hurricanes, just the city's so built up now, so the scale
[04:01.760 --> 04:03.240]  of any disaster is going to be bigger.
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.840]  It is a record storm.
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.960]  This is the voodoo they push, sacks, says Texas Governor Greg Abbott.
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.560]  These are resigned, and that we should apologize for having Houston being an oil town while
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.400]  all these liberals fly around in private jets and have carbon footprints.
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.760]  But hey, we understand, mainstream media, that it's your job to act like a sniveling
[04:22.760 --> 04:24.180]  spoiled child.
[04:24.180 --> 04:27.680]  You have to get on your knees to keep your elitist-funded paychecks.
[04:27.680 --> 04:31.400]  But see, I'll sit here, y'all trying to interview people during their worst times.
[04:31.400 --> 04:33.480]  Like, that's not the smartest thing to do.
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.320]  Like, people are really breaking down, and y'all sitting here with cameras and microphones
[04:37.320 --> 04:39.440]  trying to ask us what the f*** was wrong with us.
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.600]  And you're really trying to understand it with the microphones still in my face, with
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.320]  me shivering cold, with like kids wet, and you still putting a microphone in my face.
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.320]  Sorry.
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.360]  Russell Flores, it sounds like you've got a very upset family there.
[04:53.360 --> 04:54.360]  We're in a-
[04:54.360 --> 05:07.840]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books,
[05:07.840 --> 05:10.640]  great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.560]  We've got a new humongoid sale, not a number of things that are on massive sale, but on
[05:15.560 --> 05:16.560]  what's on sale.
[05:16.560 --> 05:21.080]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months, we've never offered super-melvitality
[05:21.080 --> 05:26.520]  known concentrated herbs, cold-pressed, super-melvitality, 57% off.
[05:26.520 --> 05:28.120]  It's never been the price.
[05:28.120 --> 05:33.600]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.600]  Unprecedented.
[05:34.600 --> 05:35.880]  And it's cold-pressed.
[05:35.880 --> 05:37.720]  That's why super-male is so different.
[05:37.720 --> 05:40.640]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science, and these
[05:40.640 --> 05:43.960]  are other- what you sell, they- BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[05:43.960 --> 05:46.040]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.320]  Why these aren't anything new?
[05:47.320 --> 05:51.480]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best butt cold-pressed?
[05:51.480 --> 05:52.480]  Do.
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.480]  Do.
[05:53.480 --> 06:02.720]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[06:02.720 --> 06:04.960]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:04.960 --> 06:06.760]  Research across the board is clear.
[06:06.760 --> 06:10.720]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[06:10.720 --> 06:12.120]  clots and heart attacks.

[06:16.720 --> 06:19.480]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[06:23.960 --> 06:26.600]  iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.

[06:31.160 --> 06:33.680]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[06:38.280 --> 06:43.240]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver and more, due to requests from listers who found that
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.680]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[06:45.680 --> 06:49.680]  We have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint-free.
