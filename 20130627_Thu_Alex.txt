[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.400 --> 00:40.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.400 --> 00:46.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the kickoff. It just happened for another live worldwide
[00:46.280 --> 00:51.200]  broadcast. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be here for the next three
[00:51.200 --> 00:52.200]  hours.
[00:52.200 --> 00:59.200]  Coming up today, we have James Lane and Richard Grove, who were in overdrive with us yesterday
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.740]  in the second hour. We're gonna get into the nature of propaganda and manipulation, not
[01:04.740 --> 01:09.280]  just classical mind control, drugging somebody or torturing them, but programming them to
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.600]  the television and through the messages in the weaponized culture, as I call it.
[01:15.600 --> 01:26.600]  And then Telly Blackwood, who has a very popular YouTube channel, has been deleted after entering
[01:26.600 --> 01:36.860]  the Paul Revere contest and getting 500,000 plus views for a video that they did where
[01:36.860 --> 01:47.680]  George Washington, it's a comedy, comes back from the past. And basically, in a joking
[01:47.680 --> 02:01.840]  way, confronts Piers Morgan and Michael Moore. Michael Moore responded to this.
[02:01.840 --> 02:08.000]  And we believe, had the video taken down, so we're gonna be getting to all of that.
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.040]  And then Matt Dubiel, who's always shooting amazing videos with the TSA and FEMA Corps
[02:15.040 --> 02:21.360]  coming to his door in Chicago. He's also the general manager of 1530 there in Chicago.
[02:21.360 --> 02:24.240]  He's gonna be in studio with us in the last 30 minutes today. He's down here visiting
[02:24.240 --> 02:28.520]  friends and family in Austin, Texas, so he's gonna be popping by.
[02:28.520 --> 02:37.720]  We're going to have open phones as well. Obviously, they are hyping up, big time, the new civil
[02:37.720 --> 02:46.440]  rights movement, quote, gay rights. And the Chicago mob boss, speaking of Chicago, Rahm
[02:46.440 --> 02:58.680]  Emanuel, said that, quote, we'll raise more money off people with alternative lifestyles
[02:58.680 --> 03:00.600]  than we will off of Jews.
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.640]  He said gays are the next Jews of fundraising. And that's all this is, is hey, come to the
[03:07.640 --> 03:12.400]  red carpet, be part of this, here's your new civil right. We're gonna put fluoride in your
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.140]  water, we're gonna force feed your GMO, we're gonna have the government kidnap over a million
[03:16.140 --> 03:17.940]  kids a year.
[03:17.940 --> 03:21.360]  We're going to launch all these illegal wars against all these nations. But as long as
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.880]  we have big gay parties, and as long as we get peace prizes, and as long as we act trendy,
[03:26.880 --> 03:32.400]  why it's all liberal, it's all loving. And that's all it is, is a cover to act like they're
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.880]  doing some type of big civil rights movement. It's incredible.
[03:36.880 --> 03:44.820]  And last night, I took my wife to see a movie that itself was almost unwatchable with Will
[03:44.820 --> 03:52.040]  Smith and his son. It looked like a made for TV movie from the 70s or something after Earth,
[03:52.040 --> 03:53.040]  but I wanted to go see it.
[03:53.040 --> 03:56.120]  And so we went to see it and we got there about 20 minutes early. So they were running
[03:56.120 --> 04:03.920]  all these ads for TV shows before the trailers even started. And they had an ad for the Fosters
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.720]  that I guess premiered in early June, but it was an ad for its premiere in early June.
[04:08.720 --> 04:16.840]  And it was a cop, two lesbian, one was a blonde, one was a black lady. And they've got a house
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.820]  full of all these kids that have obviously been kidnapped from their parents because
[04:20.820 --> 04:28.880]  that's where the heterosexual kids are hunted and then sent to predominantly these foster
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.220]  homes that are just making money off of them and a lot of them are quote gay.
[04:33.220 --> 04:38.940]  And then in the show, it's like the heterosexual parents or the biological parents know where
[04:38.940 --> 04:45.400]  they are and it shows the cop with their gun dealing with them. So the message is, we're
[04:45.400 --> 04:51.120]  coming for your kids, like Planet of the Apes, we're gonna harvest your kids. And that's
[04:51.120 --> 04:53.140]  the end of it and that's what this whole agenda is.
[04:53.140 --> 05:00.580]  This is not about freedom. This is about harming political clicks that are going to destroy.
[05:00.580 --> 05:05.300]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[05:05.300 --> 05:10.340]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[05:10.340 --> 05:17.500]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[05:17.500 --> 05:23.180]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[05:23.180 --> 05:28.980]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[05:28.980 --> 05:33.860]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[05:33.860 --> 05:40.320]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit Infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and

[07:01.140 --> 07:05.920]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[07:05.920 --> 07:11.600]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[07:11.600 --> 07:17.180]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[07:17.180 --> 07:21.500]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[07:21.500 --> 07:26.460]  be a problem? e Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you

[08:02.380 --> 08:08.420]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. In the heart of the resistance,
[08:08.420 --> 08:25.260]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Show. I am going to open the phones up again for first
[08:25.260 --> 08:32.500]  time callers on any subject or any topic you wish to discuss here on the broadcast today,
[08:32.500 --> 08:41.180]  and I'm going to go over a ton of news. Obviously, Telly Blackwood is an accomplished comedian
[08:41.180 --> 08:48.220]  and professional wrestler, and he had a very popular YouTube channel with over 9 million
[08:48.220 --> 08:55.660]  views on it. The YouTube channel is Google account that you have to have via email to
[08:55.660 --> 09:02.980]  have a YouTube now, which really violates monopoly laws, but that's another issue. And
[09:02.980 --> 09:11.460]  all of his other Google related accounts were suspended and no notice was even given to
[09:11.460 --> 09:16.860]  him of why his account was suspended. You don't get three strikes. You don't get any
[09:16.860 --> 09:23.740]  of that now. They just delete you because he did a satire piece where George Washington
[09:23.740 --> 09:27.260]  comes back from the past to the future.
[09:27.260 --> 09:36.700]  And in a comedy skit, waterboards and obese Michael Moore and Piers Morgan. We're going
[09:36.700 --> 09:42.180]  to air part of this censored video here that is extremely tame. We've had, it's very funny
[09:42.180 --> 09:52.780]  we've had over 500 good entries for the Operation Paul Revere video contest, and I said we would
[09:52.780 --> 09:56.940]  begin to announce the winners after July 4th.
[09:56.940 --> 10:01.440]  And by the end of July, I should be able to announce the first place winner. I knew this
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.940]  would be a big deal, but it has basically dominated probably 20, 30% of our time around
[10:06.940 --> 10:11.700]  here, which is a good thing. Just trying to watch all of these and trying to categorize
[10:11.700 --> 10:16.500]  them and trying to post them on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[10:16.500 --> 10:21.900]  There's only 30 or so up on the YouTube channel. We need to add all the new ones on there.
[10:21.900 --> 10:26.500]  It is a monumental task and we're building a special page that'll have maybe the top
[10:26.500 --> 10:36.180]  50 or so of these videos, but it's so hard to judge them because some people either didn't
[10:36.180 --> 10:40.780]  email the right address or the spam filter blocked it because we're finding people that
[10:40.780 --> 10:49.640]  made the deadline of getting them posted on YouTube and one other video site.
[10:49.640 --> 10:55.220]  But we didn't see them until later, so we're trying to find all the entrants as well to
[10:55.220 --> 11:03.000]  make sure. And let me tell you, if you think judging a beauty contest or a baking contest
[11:03.000 --> 11:16.240]  or a acting contest is hard, imagine having 500 at least good videos. Over 100 of them
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.380]  are incredible. Some of them are better than what you see on mainstream television, like
[11:21.380 --> 11:23.020]  a lot of them are.
[11:23.020 --> 11:28.380]  And my head is spinning. So the Operation Paul Revere has been an incredible success.
[11:28.380 --> 11:33.100]  David Knight's trying to head up, collating and getting it all together with some of the
[11:33.100 --> 11:40.500]  other crew, like Max Cabrera. But again, not only wants this contest in about a month,
[11:40.500 --> 11:43.140]  the winners have been announced.
[11:43.140 --> 11:50.580]  Not only will you have it announced by then, we will then for months after be having people
[11:50.580 --> 11:57.240]  on as guests that were entrants and trying to talk to people that are not just the top
[11:57.240 --> 12:03.580]  three winners for $120,000 in prize money, but others about what are their ideas to try
[12:03.580 --> 12:06.740]  to make films within fallwars.com.
[12:06.740 --> 12:12.500]  And all of this is going to be going on while I put together, which is really shaping up
[12:12.500 --> 12:17.500]  to be my greatest film ever, Obama Deception 2. That won't be its technical name, it'll
[12:17.500 --> 12:24.820]  be Obama Deception something, part two. But we're in the midst of working on that, and
[12:24.820 --> 12:29.260]  we're in the midst of finishing up the new studio, and we're in the midst of obviously
[12:29.260 --> 12:34.460]  trying to run the operation here to fund ourselves, and I'm not complaining.
[12:34.460 --> 12:41.740]  It's just that it's a full time job. I mean, what I could do if I just had the money sitting
[12:41.740 --> 12:45.560]  there like the private Federal Reserve does that can make up any amount of money it wants
[12:45.560 --> 12:52.260]  and give it to itself. What I could do if I didn't have to go out in the destroyed,
[12:52.260 --> 12:59.340]  crippled, dying free market in the middle of a global depression slash recession depending
[12:59.340 --> 13:06.340]  on what region you're in, and just battle to try to morally find the right products
[13:06.340 --> 13:13.180]  and sponsors to then make money to put it all, all into this operation.
[13:13.180 --> 13:21.500]  It is definitely historical and to see what's happening and to realize that Google delisted
[13:21.500 --> 13:27.060]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com about four years from the news aggregators. Google says
[13:27.060 --> 13:32.180]  their mission is to be the web and they are becoming the web and they are above the law.
[13:32.180 --> 13:36.900]  They're allowed to illegally spy when nobody else can. They're allowed to run monopolies
[13:36.900 --> 13:40.060]  and violate copyright when nobody else can.
[13:40.060 --> 13:44.360]  They're allowed to spy on people illegally and then not even get in trouble because they
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.900]  are a front for the global corporate government. The global corporatist don't want governments
[13:49.900 --> 13:55.260]  that can change hands with all the power. They want a government as a front with a global
[13:55.260 --> 14:00.300]  corporate government above it that's above the law with diplomatic corporate immunity,
[14:00.300 --> 14:03.500]  which is now being established.
[14:03.500 --> 14:12.220]  And to see them all over YouTube now, you search our videos, you can't find almost all
[14:12.220 --> 14:19.020]  of them on the Alex Jones channel and some of our other backup channels that have 400
[14:19.020 --> 14:22.620]  million views just on them and then hundreds and hundreds of millions of views on other
[14:22.620 --> 14:31.180]  channels. But you can find them on other people's channels who have listened to me over the
[14:31.180 --> 14:35.740]  years and don't put my name in any of the search functions.
[14:35.740 --> 14:41.740]  Not in the title, not in the description. And then those videos will get 100,000, 500,000
[14:41.740 --> 14:50.380]  views. And it is totally freaking the globalist out because we have just been taking over
[14:50.380 --> 14:55.300]  YouTube owned by the Pentagon and the globalist in the offshore banks. We have absolutely
[14:55.300 --> 14:57.440]  been using it against them.
[14:57.440 --> 15:10.420]  And so now they're going in using any excuse to, you do a joke of waterboarding. Michael
[15:10.420 --> 15:15.900]  Ford. It's okay to show that on all the TV shows. It's okay to show that on the family
[15:15.900 --> 15:26.540]  channels on ABC. And they show all sorts of violence. And they're doing all sorts of things
[15:26.540 --> 15:32.740]  where if we search secrets of World War Z leaked, and they didn't get us for copyright.
[15:32.740 --> 15:36.580]  They didn't ban the video, because all we did was show stills of it.
[15:36.580 --> 15:43.400]  And it's fair use to critique it even if we show the video. It says no videos found when
[15:43.400 --> 15:49.740]  it turned out there's over 100 copies of it on there. So they are delisting us right now
[15:49.740 --> 15:56.980]  every way they can, like we're a cancer. When in truth, we are trying to cut out the cancer.
[15:56.980 --> 16:02.820]  So understand, ladies and gentlemen, when you hear this broadcast, they are testing
[16:02.820 --> 16:18.020]  their systems of censorship and control against infowars.com. And just as you see police all
[16:18.020 --> 16:23.280]  over the United States come over and tell people don't videotape me in public.
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.500]  And then break their cameras and arrest them and charge them with false charges. And as
[16:28.500 --> 16:38.260]  you see police tasering people that simply ask for a warrant at their front door. This
[16:38.260 --> 16:46.060]  is because the police are being twisted and basically mutated into what police have been
[16:46.060 --> 16:48.340]  in every other authoritarian regime.
[16:48.340 --> 16:53.700]  And there's a battle within the police as well, where a lot of police are actually waking
[16:53.700 --> 17:00.620]  up. The problem is so many departments are under federal guidelines and have been federally
[17:00.620 --> 17:05.500]  programmed that when you say, no, you can't search my car, you don't have a warrant, that
[17:05.500 --> 17:10.300]  they flip out on you and in some cases physically attack you or verbally berate you.
[17:10.300 --> 17:15.180]  There's a new video small town cop throws tantrum in response to knowledgeable citizen
[17:15.180 --> 17:23.500]  that's up on infowars.com. So these are the type of issues. We know what tyranny
[17:23.500 --> 17:28.440]  looks like. And we know that it's here. And we know that if we don't speak out against
[17:28.440 --> 17:32.740]  it and wake up as a society, things are just gonna get more and more decadent, more and
[17:32.740 --> 17:39.260]  more obscene, more and more corrupt, more and more ridiculous.
[17:39.260 --> 17:46.880]  As the aberrant tyrants act out against the public, subconsciously begging someone to
[17:46.880 --> 17:53.780]  stop them. This is the nature of criminology. And if you look at the government and the
[17:53.780 --> 18:02.460]  bureaucracy and the way that they behave, they are a group of control freak sociopaths,
[18:02.460 --> 18:11.700]  psychopaths and mental patients who are trying to sell their system of corruption as trendy
[18:11.700 --> 18:17.900]  to the general public. And trying to create government special interest groups that are
[18:17.900 --> 18:28.380]  given special protection by the government to make up the cult gang guilds that will
[18:28.380 --> 18:34.140]  be the enforcers of their tyrannical system.
[18:34.140 --> 18:40.260]  But it's very important to understand the globalist are doing everything they can show
[18:40.260 --> 18:44.860]  that you can't hear this show, so that you can't watch this show, so that you can't go
[18:44.860 --> 18:52.260]  to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And as their big cyber command system goes online,
[18:52.260 --> 18:59.020]  that's on record to shut down the free web and to sabotage websites and to create Internet
[18:59.020 --> 19:02.800]  IDs where you're just banned from the web.
[19:02.800 --> 19:09.620]  This is their open plan and this is what's happening. And we are seeing a massive intensification
[19:09.620 --> 19:14.780]  of it going on right now because we are effective, but they're doing it to many other people
[19:14.780 --> 19:19.780]  as well. That's why it's so essential for every freedom lover out there to do your own
[19:19.780 --> 19:24.980]  YouTube videos and on one other alternate channel cuz they may delete you or ban you.
[19:24.980 --> 19:30.940]  That way they don't destroy what you've built. That's why it's vital to start your own blog
[19:30.940 --> 19:31.940]  or website.

[20:01.620 --> 20:06.420]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[20:06.420 --> 20:12.100]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[20:12.100 --> 20:17.700]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[20:17.700 --> 20:22.020]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[20:22.020 --> 20:26.960]  be a problem? E Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you

[24:20.900 --> 24:31.900]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we're here live. Back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[24:31.900 --> 24:37.780]  live. And then of course back weeknight 7 o'clock central then Fall Wars. Nightly news,
[24:37.780 --> 24:44.620]  I am your host Alex Jones. All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls here because
[24:44.620 --> 24:47.780]  I'm trying to kind of switch the show up a little bit because I never seem to get to
[24:47.780 --> 24:53.780]  calls and then I'm going to get into the news. I'm going to give you my take from deep research
[24:53.780 --> 24:58.660]  on what's really going on with this whole civil rights movement as Chuck Schumer calls
[24:58.660 --> 25:08.820]  it for quote gay and lesbian rights and what's happening on that front.
[25:08.820 --> 25:13.780]  I'm going to break down exactly what's happening. You can turn on the television and tell what's
[25:13.780 --> 25:21.220]  going on there. You can turn on any Hollywood television show and you can see the agenda.
[25:21.220 --> 25:31.140]  And by the way, on record the agenda is admitted to be a UN official global program working
[25:31.140 --> 25:37.760]  with national producers of every major country part of UNESCO to stabilize population by
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.820]  reducing fertility, using soap operas and sitcoms. This is directly from the United
[25:43.820 --> 25:44.820]  Nations.
[25:44.820 --> 25:48.220]  Going to be getting to that. I just want to let you know what this is all about. And then
[25:48.220 --> 25:53.100]  they make it a civil right and avant garde and really cool. And then they make it the
[25:53.100 --> 25:59.060]  year hateful if you're not for it. And so by all means, teach our five year olds not
[25:59.060 --> 26:00.060]  just about sex.
[26:00.060 --> 26:08.100]  Well, that would be pedophilia. Teach them about same sex relationships. And it's a civil
[26:08.100 --> 26:16.500]  right. Just ask the BBC with their top hosts continually caught with dead bodies of children.
[26:16.500 --> 26:23.060]  I mean, it's not enough to have sex with children. I mean, you got to have sex with dead bodies.
[26:23.060 --> 26:28.900]  I mean, every week, some new BBC reporter, it comes out, is pleading guilty to sex with
[26:28.900 --> 26:33.140]  small children or sex with dead bodies or Satan worship.
[26:33.140 --> 26:42.900]  But again, I'm being hateful. The truth is the ultimate thrill for these people is to
[26:42.900 --> 26:47.100]  force this on everyone. I said I'd get to this later. I went to a movie last night with
[26:47.100 --> 26:54.580]  my wife. We got there about 25 minutes early. I told her I didn't want to get there early.
[26:54.580 --> 26:59.540]  I said they play TV ads for TV shows before this. I said the trailers are too long. We
[26:59.540 --> 27:08.540]  get there and we're subjected to one ad after another for current ABC shows.
[27:08.540 --> 27:24.380]  Where the dads are all idiots and they cut to another show. Called The Fosters. And it's
[27:24.380 --> 27:28.620]  two women. One of them is a cop, of course, the authority figure. The message is the state
[27:28.620 --> 27:35.580]  is your husband and she's the man. She's the boss. And they've got a house just full of
[27:35.580 --> 27:38.420]  foster kids they've taken from their biological parents.
[27:38.420 --> 27:42.140]  And they say that the bad guys, I went and looked it up last night, but I could see it
[27:42.140 --> 27:46.920]  in the ad. The bad guys in every episode, I guess, they've had four episodes so far,
[27:46.920 --> 27:54.240]  are biological parents. But don't worry, the female cop, she goes and takes them out. Daddy
[27:54.240 --> 28:02.420]  takes them out. And then they say real aggressively in the voiceover, it's a new kind of family,
[28:02.420 --> 28:05.660]  America's new family.
[28:05.660 --> 28:12.780]  And it's the blonde woman, the house slave with the other people of the state and she
[28:12.780 --> 28:19.740]  wears the uniform and she crushes the parents, the biological parents. And then the son,
[28:19.740 --> 28:24.900]  who is the biological son, they say, you're the biological son. He goes, there is no biological
[28:24.900 --> 28:31.180]  son here. It's like, see, the only way to prove you're good is to get rid of masculinity,
[28:31.180 --> 28:32.340]  get rid of the family.
[28:32.340 --> 28:39.580]  Because the family is hateful. And I've shown you textbooks on air that they give the CPS,
[28:39.580 --> 28:44.540]  that they teach at the University of Texas, where it says the family belongs to an arcane
[28:44.540 --> 28:53.860]  age. It needs to be done away with. We've done whole shows reading these quotes and
[28:53.860 --> 28:58.140]  we're going to get rid of it and we're going to do all this.
[28:58.140 --> 29:03.280]  And all this is really about at a scientific level is so they can euthanize you and you
[29:03.280 --> 29:09.460]  won't have any family stand up for you. And when you read the UN programs on this, it's
[29:09.460 --> 29:16.100]  not about you're dancing around together and your gay love and all this. I mean, I'll be
[29:16.100 --> 29:20.080]  honest with people, quite frankly, this isn't even on my radar screen.
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.420]  People think, you hate what I do, that makes it more fun. No, come on, give me a break.
[29:24.420 --> 29:27.060]  Let's talk about the real world here. Let's talk about chemicals that are put in the food
[29:27.060 --> 29:32.820]  and water to sterilize people. Let's talk about how they shot up the gay community in
[29:32.820 --> 29:38.060]  New York with the HIV and the hepatitis vaccines. Is that because they loved you? No, they use
[29:38.060 --> 29:44.220]  your promiscuity as the vector to spread it. Now, if you think being murdered by the government
[29:44.220 --> 29:48.780]  is cool, then I understand. Naturally, they have bug chasers. They do some of them. They
[29:48.780 --> 29:53.580]  want to die. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:53.580 --> 30:03.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Now is the perfect time to spring clean your

[33:12.620 --> 33:38.220]  it's Alex Jones. Again folks, we are here back live. Thank
[33:38.220 --> 33:43.420]  you so much for joining us. I am your host Alex Jones and I'm about to go straight to
[33:43.420 --> 33:50.980]  your phone calls. And then coming up, I'm going to get into some of this incredible
[33:50.980 --> 33:51.980]  news.
[33:51.980 --> 33:56.900]  St. Louis police chief wants drones to patrol high crime areas and that's where they've
[33:56.900 --> 34:02.940]  had the military doing open martial law drills as well. UAVs would also track suspicious
[34:02.940 --> 34:09.980]  vehicles. Drone spies on sunbathing woman looks through apartment windows, then falls
[34:09.980 --> 34:17.740]  out of the sky. That's a prisonplanet.com article. You see video of all of that happening.
[34:17.740 --> 34:24.260]  And then continuing with some of the other news that we're going to be getting to that
[34:24.260 --> 34:34.900]  is just incredibly important, obviously, to say the least. If you go up to infowars.com,
[34:34.900 --> 34:40.820]  you can actually see some of these headlines. What's happened is, is I had the stack of
[34:40.820 --> 34:48.060]  news here in front of me and now I can't find it, so I'm going to the website myself. Friend,
[34:48.060 --> 34:53.580]  Michael Hastings marked for death. And what I did was, is I actually changed that headline
[34:53.580 --> 34:58.100]  to make it a little bit more accurate to what the guest said on the show yesterday.
[34:58.100 --> 35:07.420]  Michael Hastings told he would be hunted down and killed over McChrystal story. So that's
[35:07.420 --> 35:17.700]  a pretty darn important piece of news right there. Because I'll be honest with you, I
[35:17.700 --> 35:22.460]  hadn't followed Michael Hastings too closely until he died. I mean, I knew who he was and
[35:22.460 --> 35:26.660]  what he'd done. But I didn't know all the details that in his book he said the army
[35:26.660 --> 35:28.780]  told you, we will kill you for this.
[35:28.780 --> 35:38.220]  You are a dead man by multiple officers. I didn't know that he told his friends in country
[35:38.220 --> 35:42.740]  in Afghanistan that he was told he was gonna be killed. I didn't know he told them right
[35:42.740 --> 35:50.580]  before he died that I've been told they're coming to kill me. I didn't know the details
[35:50.580 --> 35:57.260]  that he was about to break a big CIA story or that the family's scared to talk and that
[35:57.260 --> 35:59.740]  they believe he was killed.
[35:59.740 --> 36:08.220]  And now that's been in the news for two days. I saw that in an RT article at the bottom
[36:08.220 --> 36:24.420]  of the story on Tuesday night. So we called Staff Sergeant up and got him on the broadcast,
[36:24.420 --> 36:31.780]  Biggs. And he went to the funeral, talked to the wife, talked to the family.
[36:31.780 --> 36:36.340]  I mean, they believe he was murdered. They believe the evidence points towards that.
[36:36.340 --> 36:45.540]  And that's big news that his wife said, quote, I'm gonna take down whoever did this. And
[36:45.540 --> 36:50.540]  now we have a new article out today. Michael Hastings told he would be hunted down and
[36:50.540 --> 36:53.220]  killed over McChrystal's story.
[36:53.220 --> 36:57.640]  Friends and family called for independent investigation. I mean, that's bombshell news.
[36:57.640 --> 37:05.300]  And the controlled corporate media is so cowardly that this has been out now on my site for
[37:05.300 --> 37:13.260]  over a day. And it's been out total for two days. And even RT didn't think it should be
[37:13.260 --> 37:15.980]  the headline, just buried in there.
[37:15.980 --> 37:19.460]  The family, by the way, thinks he was probably murdered and he was death-threaded. They said
[37:19.460 --> 37:23.880]  they were coming to kill him and he was told by army officers. I mean, the family should
[37:23.880 --> 37:28.440]  be being interviewed. We're trying to talk to them right now and they just say they have
[37:28.440 --> 37:32.660]  too much grief and they're scared.
[37:32.660 --> 37:40.180]  But in a month or something, this will just be swept under the rug. This will all just
[37:40.180 --> 37:48.580]  be swept under the rug. And this is the type of overwhelming information that we're covering
[37:48.580 --> 37:52.820]  on this broadcast. I mentioned this yesterday, I've since watched the local newscast about
[37:52.820 --> 37:55.000]  it where they report on it with a straight face.
[37:55.000 --> 38:03.180]  And it's so incredible that the young man who wore a pro-Second Amendment NRA shirt
[38:03.180 --> 38:08.600]  that said, defend our rights, was arrested. And now they've done a gag order saying he
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.460]  and his family can't talk to the press about their right to keep and bear arms. I mean,
[38:13.460 --> 38:15.540]  that's completely illegal what the judge did.
[38:15.540 --> 38:23.500]  In California, Judge Order's First Amendment outlawed in bank graffiti case. And with a
[38:23.500 --> 38:31.860]  straight face, they're like, he wrote anti-federal reserve messages in water soluble chalk. Like
[38:31.860 --> 38:39.940]  kids go out and draw pictures of flowers in a house and clouds, or a puppy dog or Superman.
[38:39.940 --> 38:45.020]  They don't arrest them, they only arrest you if it's political, the most protected speech.
[38:45.020 --> 38:49.980]  And then the judge says, the First Amendment, not only are we gonna throw the book at you
[38:49.980 --> 38:56.420]  for something that's clearly protected speech, but we're going to not let you use the First
[38:56.420 --> 38:58.100]  Amendment as a defense.
[38:58.100 --> 39:03.260]  And that's on the news like it's a good thing. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you understand
[39:03.260 --> 39:10.020]  that this is like opening the portal on a spaceship to space and letting the atmosphere
[39:10.020 --> 39:21.940]  out of the capsule. This is politically, societally, culturally, suicide. And I wanna be clear
[39:21.940 --> 39:32.660]  whenever I get into this whole situation with the quote gay rights in the media.
[39:32.660 --> 39:38.660]  This is all designed so that when you say, hey, what about a man and a woman? What about
[39:38.660 --> 39:42.660]  this institution? What about it in toward they can say, you're hateful. You don't want
[39:42.660 --> 39:52.100]  totally open borders. You're hateful. Well, nobody else has totally open borders. I don't
[39:52.100 --> 39:53.300]  want government run health care.
[39:53.300 --> 39:57.380]  Well, you're racist and hateful. Well, I don't wanna turn my guns in. You're racist. You
[39:57.380 --> 40:03.900]  see this and it's simply meant to say you're a demon, you're a criminal, you're bad. They
[40:03.900 --> 40:11.460]  have a national poll out where a large percentage of Democrats say they believe the Tea Party
[40:11.460 --> 40:14.020]  are terrorists that should be arrested.
[40:14.020 --> 40:19.540]  Well, Mark Dice went out on the street and every person but one person he talked to.
[40:19.540 --> 40:25.620]  That's not edited, folks, except for Brevity. He's not just showing you the people that
[40:25.620 --> 40:30.200]  said arrest the Tea Party, arrest all gun owners, put them in FEMA camps. That's what
[40:30.200 --> 40:36.540]  most Californians agreed with. They all spoke English clearly. They were black, white, Hispanic,
[40:36.540 --> 40:37.780]  Asian, you name it.
[40:37.780 --> 40:40.780]  And they would stop and say, I agree with you. You don't have to convince me they need
[40:40.780 --> 40:47.620]  to be arrested. They're ready to arrest us, folks. I know about this from working on family
[40:47.620 --> 40:53.040]  court cases for people as a media person who has folks come to me. I've been to the family
[40:53.040 --> 40:56.460]  court, I've looked at the statistics, I've talked to whistleblowers.
[40:56.460 --> 41:03.700]  A large percentage of the children being taken from families, good families, are being done
[41:03.700 --> 41:17.780]  by weird gangs, sex gangs, weird sex cults. I mean, in ancient Rome and ancient Babylon,
[41:17.780 --> 41:22.780]  usually things were run by strange sex cults. And they did different things, but the point
[41:22.780 --> 41:29.760]  was it would be sex cults, heterosexual, whatever. It was all sorts of weird ones.
[41:29.760 --> 41:41.180]  Look it up in history and you find out that the sheriff and her wife, who's also a sheriff's
[41:41.180 --> 41:47.820]  deputy, I've seen this all over the country, will have four foster kids. And then you're
[41:47.820 --> 41:52.060]  told by inside sheriff's departments, you know those were taken from families. Right
[41:52.060 --> 41:59.200]  here in town and given to them. It's things like that. And then you go and observe it.
[41:59.200 --> 42:03.400]  And then you go and find out families, they'll even brag and go, man, you got some really
[42:03.400 --> 42:07.420]  good healthy kids, you know, ages two and five, they're ours.
[42:07.420 --> 42:15.980]  And then the courts are run in more than a third of the cases by kind of Janet Reno big
[42:15.980 --> 42:21.560]  sis ladies. And the fact is that's what it is. And then they take your kids and give
[42:21.560 --> 42:27.560]  it to their friends who are a female cult. Just like in the Justice Department, they
[42:27.560 --> 42:33.640]  would call in the FBI top guys, they call in the Justice Department men and say, take
[42:33.640 --> 42:40.200]  your clothes off, scum, drink water out of the toilet, move your stuff to the bathroom.
[42:40.200 --> 42:46.580]  I can't say a lot of it on air, you can go read the lawsuits they settled. And it turned
[42:46.580 --> 42:50.360]  out they weren't even really lesbians, they were just dominators. So they would also demand
[42:50.360 --> 42:52.960]  sex from the men, cuz that's a big part of this.
[42:52.960 --> 42:59.240]  It's about power and they take testosterone. These are just like supercharged crazy women.
[42:59.240 --> 43:06.080]  And man, they're just taking everybody's kids. I mean, it is devilish. And I gotta say, and
[43:06.080 --> 43:13.480]  there are a lot of women that are gay or whatever who are nice people. I'm not saying this as,
[43:13.480 --> 43:20.960]  I'm talking about what is there, what is a fact. And then they use the nice gay community
[43:20.960 --> 43:22.760]  as fundraisers.
[43:22.760 --> 43:28.240]  This is your civil right, you better give 10, 20, 30% of your earnings. And that's what
[43:28.240 --> 43:33.120]  the mayor of Chicago, the godfather, is in the news saying, gays are the new Jews, that's
[43:33.120 --> 43:43.280]  a quote. Because they don't have family, they don't have anything. All they have are these
[43:43.280 --> 43:47.600]  dinners, all they have are these banquets.
[43:47.600 --> 43:51.600]  And then at the banquets, they teach them, no, you need kids, don't you want kids? Actually,
[43:51.600 --> 43:57.160]  I do want kids, we're going to get them for you. Gays are the next Jews for fundraising,
[43:57.160 --> 44:04.480]  there's the headline out of the news. What is that, Politico? That's the examiner, Washington
[44:04.480 --> 44:05.880]  Examiner.
[44:05.880 --> 44:11.440]  So I'm telling you how this really works, folks. Just like in a small town, you get
[44:11.440 --> 44:19.020]  old white guys getting together, boss hogging the mainly white population or the black population.
[44:19.020 --> 44:23.240]  Or you'll get black gangs feeding on black gangs, or you'll get Hispanic gangs feeding
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.360]  on Hispanic gangs, or Jewish gangs feeding on Jewish gangs.
[44:27.360 --> 44:33.600]  I mean, people put themselves into gangs, and I'm going to your calls. It's just that,
[44:33.600 --> 44:37.720]  what about the civil right of not having foreign banks steal $85 billion a month from the American
[44:37.720 --> 44:44.400]  people? What about the civil right of not having General Electric above the law and
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.240]  able to shut down all the power plants that they don't own, so only they make giant profits
[44:50.240 --> 44:51.400]  out of artificial scarcity?
[44:51.400 --> 44:57.000]  What about the civil right of not having hydrofluoroelastic acid that on record lowers IQs added to the
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.160]  water? What about the civil right of not being taxed on property taxes so much you can't
[45:02.160 --> 45:05.280]  afford to send your children where you want to school so that you've got to send them
[45:05.280 --> 45:07.960]  to a government training camp?
[45:07.960 --> 45:11.880]  What about the civil right of not having illegal wars carried out in our name all over the
[45:11.880 --> 45:20.060]  world? What about the civil right of not having the NSA sitting there illegally spying on
[45:20.060 --> 45:28.660]  all of us? No, no, no. Instead, it's the civil right that you get free housing, which means
[45:28.660 --> 45:32.600]  the government doles everything out, and they can bankrupt the middle class.
[45:32.600 --> 45:37.760]  Or you get the civil right if you get to come to America and get welfare and free tax refund
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.820]  checks and everything. It's really a corporate supplement, so you'll work for wages that
[45:41.820 --> 45:46.960]  nobody else could live on to lower the overall wages.
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.400]  Or you read the official Earth Policy Institute, and the UN has official programs on this.
[45:52.400 --> 45:58.920]  Look up the UN's use of sitcoms and dramas produced by Hollywood companies for worldwide
[45:58.920 --> 46:08.900]  distribution. Eco-economy building an economy for the Earth. Chapter 10, stabilizing population
[46:08.900 --> 46:12.680]  by reducing fertility using soap operas and sitcoms.
[46:12.680 --> 46:18.960]  And they're now putting homosexual messages in these, and that's why Obama was in Africa,
[46:18.960 --> 46:27.280]  and the Africans got real upset about it. Because they understand, just like GMO food
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.060]  being shipped in, GMO seeds, it is an attempt to break down the only thing these poor people
[46:32.060 --> 46:34.000]  have is their families.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.780]  They get the fact that they take care of grandma, somebody's gonna take care of them. They get
[46:38.780 --> 46:44.900]  the fact that they got their people, their peeps. They understand that, folks. And this
[46:44.900 --> 46:54.240]  is purely, these messages are not about the 30s and 40s and 50s in areas of New York where
[46:54.240 --> 47:03.760]  people in their own gangs were mean to conspicuously consuming homosexuals.
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.240]  And so some people got beat up, all because it was culturally seen as okay to beat up
[47:08.240 --> 47:17.400]  gay people. Because again, that's predatory. See, now it's just flipping it predatory,
[47:17.400 --> 47:22.200]  where the abused have been taught how to abuse, so now they go out.
[47:22.200 --> 47:25.440]  And everybody's been taught to be politically correct, so people don't even care. But then
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.320]  it doesn't matter when your kids are taken, and then they won't tell you where they went.
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.200]  They went to groups in many cases that can't reproduce, whether that's heterosexual couples
[47:35.200 --> 47:36.920]  or homosexual couples.
[47:36.920 --> 47:41.720]  And you also have this destruction of language that's going on that I find to be extremely
[47:41.720 --> 47:49.500]  frustrating. Where they arrest people in Europe now for using the word homosexual because
[47:49.500 --> 47:52.520]  someone feels like it's hurtful to them.
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.040]  Just like they'll arrest you in Europe if you use the name for someone from Africa,
[47:57.040 --> 48:02.960]  the scientific name. I mean, the word Caucasian is not a racist slur. If someone starts using
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.260]  it as a racist slur, should we ban it? This is an attack on language. And if you go look
[48:08.260 --> 48:11.440]  at the man on the street interviews we do in Austin, or the man on the street interviews
[48:11.440 --> 48:17.160]  in LA, most of these people do not know what planet they're on.
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.400]  But they know politically they better do whatever the television says. And in closing, and I'll
[48:22.400 --> 48:29.440]  go to your phone calls. As I saw last night when I went to a movie, and they have this
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.460]  stuff on before family movies too. They are bombarding with every message where males
[48:34.460 --> 48:38.120]  are bad, fathers are bad.
[48:38.120 --> 48:44.200]  It's rare to see a pro-father message. Mother-father changed to parent one, parent two on passport
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.440]  applications. The federal government has said that it's a EEOC violation in the federal
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.680]  government. If you talk about your husband or your wife or a wedding you're going to.
[48:55.680 --> 49:01.120]  You see, those of us that are attracted to women, men, we're bad. Women are attracted
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.680]  to men, you're bad. And that's not saying the entire group of people cuz I will not
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.120]  give you the power, some of you want, to think I don't like you so that makes your lifestyle
[49:11.120 --> 49:12.120]  more fun.
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.840]  I mean, give me a break. I'm light years past all this, okay, for people out there that
[49:16.840 --> 49:23.120]  are obsessed with this. Sexuality for me is a very small part of my life. And it's all
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.180]  part of this arrested development of people shoving their sexuality in front of you. It's
[49:28.180 --> 49:33.920]  like people at work throughout my life, now you've seen who will kiss in front of each
[49:33.920 --> 49:39.720]  other or grab on each other or stand in front of the window and sit there and hug and kiss
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.220]  and rub on each other in front of everybody. They're doing it in front of everybody because
[49:44.220 --> 49:48.760]  it's just a form of getting in your space.
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.220]  And that's what this is. I mean, I am sick of, I can't watch television because it's
[49:53.220 --> 50:04.560]  all anti male, anti family, absolute bias and then shoving in the face 24 seven. Well,
[50:04.560 --> 50:08.960]  I mean, I don't like how they are, Nickelodeon bragged a few years ago that they were gonna
[50:08.960 --> 50:16.040]  sexualize under 10s with both heterosexual and homosexual messages. And then you look
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.360]  at the clothes they try to sell for little girls. It's like hooker outfits for seven
[50:20.360 --> 50:21.360]  year olds.
[50:21.360 --> 50:28.000]  I mean, and again, that is offensive. That's sexualizing. It's soft child porn. You look
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.440]  at the billboards and the ads to sell some of the biggest designers and it's soft child
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.400]  porn. This is the decadence of the ruling elite projected onto us. But it's more than
[50:39.400 --> 50:44.680]  that. Above that, there's a method of the madness to break up the family. So the state
[50:44.680 --> 50:48.740]  is the mommy and the daddy and shows like the Fosters.
[50:48.740 --> 50:54.000]  The man of the house is a cop woman and they literally go out and grab people's kids. And
[50:54.000 --> 51:01.040]  the bad guys are the biological parents trying to get their kids back. I mean, it's incredible.

[54:22.960 --> 54:28.860]  By the way, I get them all mixed up. Yesterday I was saying Nero and Caligula like to dress
[54:28.860 --> 54:34.540]  up like werewolves and tie children up and rip their throats out, mainline history. Actually,
[54:34.540 --> 54:39.720]  it was Caligula like to dress up like the werewolf and tear the throats out. Nero like
[54:39.720 --> 54:40.720]  a lion.
[54:40.720 --> 54:45.560]  Can we put the Daily Mail up for people, please? From the official Roman histories. We actually
[54:45.560 --> 54:52.000]  had the article up during the break just now, your Daily Mail on Nero. And we'll go to that
[54:52.000 --> 55:00.320]  in just a moment here today. No, E Foods Direct is not the lion. I just had it during the
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.680]  break on that monitor right there. And then I said, I saw you go to another page. I said,
[55:04.680 --> 55:10.160]  no, we're going to go to that right now. It's not a big deal. I just want to show TV viewers,
[55:10.160 --> 55:16.920]  people that are watching out there on prisonplanet.tv that info. But you know what? I can search
[55:16.920 --> 55:20.600]  it during a break and put it on my screen for everybody. The point is, is that this
[55:20.600 --> 55:27.780]  is the type of corruption and decadence and things that go on over and over and over again
[55:27.780 --> 55:29.160]  in societies.
[55:29.160 --> 55:36.860]  Please don't forget to support this broadcast. We have some of the very best deals out there
[55:36.860 --> 55:41.200]  for folks who would like to filter their water and not drink what the globalists are putting
[55:41.200 --> 55:48.000]  in there. We have the ProPure water filtration system with 10% off with promo code water
[55:48.000 --> 55:57.240]  available at Infowarsstore.com. We have the new July issue of the magazine that has 10
[55:57.240 --> 56:02.320]  high quality Infowars.com bumper stickers inside of it and things like listen to the
[56:02.320 --> 56:08.040]  Alex Jones show at Infowars.com. That is available. You can buy these at cost in bulk of magazines
[56:08.040 --> 56:15.560]  of 10 up to 100. And so 100 magazines would be a thousand bumper stickers to put up in
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.720]  legal lawful areas. And it covers the fact that you are the target of the NSA spying.
[56:19.720 --> 56:23.920]  Great way to wake up friends and family. You can also give a 12 month gift subscription
[56:23.920 --> 56:31.640]  to Infowars magazine as well. Right now, let's go ahead and go to Eric in Massachusetts.
[56:31.640 --> 56:32.960]  Go ahead. You're on the air.
[56:32.960 --> 56:41.680]  Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah. You want me to talk to you, bro, or what do you want to do?
[56:41.680 --> 56:47.440]  Sorry. Um, my idea, I have a suggestion. People are always looking for solutions and what
[56:47.440 --> 56:52.080]  we can do. And I know you always tell your listeners, we need to spread the word and
[56:52.080 --> 56:57.520]  that sometimes feels like a few attempts. However, you know, we do our best. I had an
[56:57.520 --> 57:03.400]  idea though that maybe you could possibly, only you could possibly put together. Back
[57:03.400 --> 57:12.120]  in 1776, I'll spare people the history lesson, but we had to have to create a declaration
[57:12.120 --> 57:19.120]  of independence. And I think if you put together all your guests, like Gerald Cilenti, Ron
[57:19.120 --> 57:26.680]  Paul, you all came together and helped come up with real solutions, because you guys are
[57:26.680 --> 57:31.760]  aware you're not compartmentalized. You're aware of what the plan is. Basically like
[57:31.760 --> 57:36.760]  an antique Bilderberg. They have their Bilderberg event where they get together and have their
[57:36.760 --> 57:38.760]  meeting. Why don't we have that?
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.800]  Well, I mean, just because we have a meeting, I don't know what that's going to do. People
[57:43.800 --> 57:47.800]  just seem to have meetings after meetings. In most corporations, the army admits they
[57:47.800 --> 57:53.040]  spend most of their time now having PowerPoint meetings. I'm not poo-pooing your idea entirely.
[57:53.040 --> 57:58.260]  It's just that, I mean, the big thing is for people to stand up and say, no, is this society
[57:58.260 --> 58:01.840]  is the main thing that I'm basically trying to get at here?
[58:01.840 --> 58:08.840]  No, I understand and I agree. It's just that in order to really come up with some solutions
[58:08.840 --> 58:14.400]  and some plans and stuff like that, we would really need a team of people that are aware
[58:14.400 --> 58:21.560]  and are up at the level that you, Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, Peter Schiff, Mark Kaiser.
[58:21.560 --> 58:29.440]  I mean, even if you really televised it, as a viewer, I would gladly pay $10 to view such
[58:29.440 --> 58:33.200]  a meeting where you guys sat around and brainstormed ideas.
[58:33.200 --> 58:38.760]  Well, I mean, that is an idea to have big conferences with public brainstorms. That's
[58:38.760 --> 58:39.760]  a good idea.
[58:39.760 --> 58:51.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.400 --> 58:56.640]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[58:56.640 --> 59:01.480]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping
[59:01.480 --> 59:06.500]  or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's a new

[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:29.360]  I'm continuing with your phone calls right now, and I will continue into the next hour
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:39.300]  with them as well. We're going to go to your phone calls right now, and we have some special
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:44.960]  guests in studio coming up in the next segment. Let's go to Joshua in California. You're on
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960]  the air, Joshua.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:52.560]  Hey, Alex. I like what the caller was saying before about an idea of a meeting. I was thinking
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:58.360]  in terms of what she's probably thinking in terms of what kind of a meeting would you
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:05.200]  have that would be of magnitude like a Bilderberg that could really incite some fear into the
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.840]  globalist elite that basically wanted to destroy everybody. That kind of ties into my question
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.920]  is that you were talking about the other day things like religion really sell any kind
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:26.840]  of holes from this. I was doing my own studies, and I noticed that you seem to fit the perfect
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.200]  description of what biblically is described as Elijah, the guy that turns everybody basically
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.960]  back to their fathers and then their fathers to them, kind of like the founding fathers.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.000]  So I was kind of wondering, what is your take on doing some kind of a thing like that?
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.360]  Well, it's funny we've had two calls in a row doing this. I hear what the caller is
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.440]  saying, and I'm flattered. I hear what you're saying. Really, we're having a public meeting
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.280]  right now with this radio TV show, and I'm trying to get people to realize the different
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:06.320]  crimes that are being committed against them and just how out of control all of this is.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:12.520]  And we just have to continue to grow the real media so that we could have Continental Congresses
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:18.720]  down the road that the public is able to actually see and hear about. I mean, so much of this
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.120]  is that the globalists still have not even so much the dominant media, but even people
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.400]  that are awake still kind of think it's dominant, one of the final dominoes to fall.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:36.160]  And so that's a big subject to have, but I think conferences are good. I think people
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.440]  having big debates are good. But so much of it is about getting the public in their area
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:49.080]  to speak out and stand up and not comply. I mean, a free people, uninformed people,
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.520]  is what it takes to have liberty.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.840]  And that's what Thomas Jefferson said. He said, inform the whole of the people and tyranny
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:03.040]  will vanish like phantoms at dawn. And that's exactly what we need to do. And so it's a
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.440]  process more than it is some big, giant event that will happen. I mean, you could have an
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:14.360]  event, a moment in television where something catches the public's attention and the establishment
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.040]  will declare that it's a defeat for liberty when really it's a big victory.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.960]  That's why they don't want me back on Piers Morgan. They don't want me back on any national
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.340]  TV show, because I will get people out of their trance by pointing out how outrageous
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:32.280]  it is that a foreigner is here lecturing us about taking our guns when it's the serotonin
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.580]  reuptake inhibitors that are linked to most of the mass shootings.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:41.800]  And how dare you try to blame us for what individuals do? How dare you as a collectivist
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.960]  try to put collectivist guilt on me? And how dare you say that if I don't support five
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:54.600]  year olds being taught how to masturbate at public school, I mean, they might as well
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.520]  just let the pedophiles out of jail then.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.800]  How dare you say that I hate gay people or something if I don't wanna teach kids how
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.480]  to masturbate? You see, they just sell their sick agendas just to see what they can get
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.100]  away with by breaking our will and making us feel like we're guilty and have done something.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:21.560]  And we just have to point out how crazy all of this has gotten. You hear what I'm saying?
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.800]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I figured I was muted there. But no, I totally know what you mean, especially
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.560]  with the whole pushing the agenda of almost like a pedophilia, like the sexualization
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.640]  of little children. I was at a meeting with what they call the women's lib movement and
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.040]  they were kind of pushing that agenda.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.360]  And I just straight up said something and the people that were with me were like, yeah,
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.760]  we don't want this for our kids or grandchildren or whatever.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.000]  So you went to a women's lib meeting trying to be nice and this is what was going on.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.640]  It's like the White House at a gay lesbian deal having like seven-year-old girls up there
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:00.560]  or whatever. Why? Why at an event that's about sexuality do you have kids? It's incredible.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.200]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.080]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.760]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.320]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.880]  on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.200]  now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.880]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.280]  shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.280]  has fallen.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.480]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.440]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.080]  of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.440]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.480]  us destructive storms. Twenty-four hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.920]  wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.680]  problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.000]  will really be a problem?

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.480]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.620]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:15.360]  of information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:22.120]  to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:27.120]  machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.880]  somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.080]  it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast, you need
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:41.080]  to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:08:05.920]  would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:12.920]  Great brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:41.160]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the rest of the hour, we are joined by two gentlemen that
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.440]  are here in town, working with us on several films. And of course, getting ready for the
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.480]  promotion of State of Mind, The Psychology of Control, a great new documentary they've
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480]  made.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:01.120]  We have the historian and researcher, Richard Grove, here with us. And then of course, we
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:07.040]  also have James Lane of freemindfilms.com. And they're also going to be taping with us
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.840]  tonight for intros and outros and a breakdown of State of Mind that is going to be premiering
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:21.880]  July 17th next month on Infowars Nightly News for all prisonplanet.tv viewers and subscribers.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.720]  They also made the film A Noble Lie.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.240]  And we're almost sold out of the good deal I got on the animated documentary about the
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.640]  history of the private Federal Reserve being far and owned. Riveting film, we'll still
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.200]  carry it, but I'm not gonna be able to get as good a deal as I got on it to where I can
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.400]  give it away free.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.800]  So we'll still be selling it, but we won't be able to offer it free very, very soon.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:51.000]  Probably today or tomorrow, cuz we're selling out of the free DVD American Dream when you
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.840]  get on Blu-ray or on DVD State of Mind at infowarsstore.com. We are the exclusive distributor
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.640]  for the next three months of the film.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.000]  But I didn't mean to start this hour with a plug. The point is that's why they're here.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.960]  But we were talking during the break, guys, and I had you on Overdrive yesterday. And
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:13.000]  again, I've done a lot of deep research in the New World Order, reading their own writings.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.200]  And so I know what their real game plan is, which you can learn too if you just do the
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.720]  research.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.400]  But talking to Mr. Grove and Mr. Lane, who I've known off and on over the years, they
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.600]  really have done their research and have a fix on what's happening. So I asked them during
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:35.760]  the break, I said, what do you think is at the underlying push for saying two men together,
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.760]  two women together is marriage?
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.080]  What is behind the sexualization of children? What is behind showing men as fathers as being
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.520]  dumb idiots in every show? What is behind it? Well, the UN actually, and I covered this
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:57.780]  last hour, officially says they produce dramas and soap operas to break up the family worldwide.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:03.380]  And they say to reduce the family. The state is in competition with it, but you guys had
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.280]  some of the deeper reasons for it.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.760]  And again, Huxley in Brave New World in 1932, published in 33, he said that would all be
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.480]  done the end of the family, the end of the institution. This is part of the dehumanization.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.040]  And so they try to make it like a civil right. And like, you hate these groups of people.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.760]  It has nothing to do with what you individually, what your identity is, what you stand for.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.880]  They're trying to program a false identity into what you would have been naturally, ladies
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.800]  and gentlemen, cold bloodedly.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:41.880]  To then create artificial groups that want to operate as families, but then are gonna
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:48.360]  use the state to come and harvest biological families, children to create this new structure
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:55.840]  where the mom is a cop and her wife is a woman. She's the man on these shows that are out
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.040]  there that I was just talking about in the last hour.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.680]  Just absolutely incredible. And I've kind of gone off on a ranting jag about this. The
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.680]  show is called The Fosters. And I saw the promo last night before a movie. And at the
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.000]  end they go, the biological parents know they're here. And the man of the house, the female
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.600]  cop, she gets her gun and goes and takes them down.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:25.240]  Well, in the real world, they are attacking heterosexuals. And again, I'm not saying the
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:31.000]  entire group of people that have different sexual persuasions are doing that. The government
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.200]  is advertising, hey, we wanna put you in as the cult commanders. We want you to be the
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.400]  new synthetic family. We're gonna provide you the kids. We're gonna harvest from the
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.100]  heterosexuals.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:50.920]  And the shows now are going from men are bad to saying mother or father is hateful. France
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.200]  has banned it. The federal government's banning it. The EEOC is telling federal employees
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.440]  who are a kept group of slaves more than others, they're deeper down the rat hole, that you
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.160]  will not say at a company party, my husband or wife, that is hate speech.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.880]  Now that came out two weeks ago. Gigi Arnett here in our office did a report on that from
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:15.600]  their own Justice Department website. So you guys have studied this in depth. You get into
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:22.360]  the mass mind control that's going on. Richard Grove, James Lane, break down your take on
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360]  this huge issue.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:30.200]  I mean, it's genius to frame sexualizing children and teaching them about heterosexual or homosexual
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:37.160]  sex at age five as civil rights training. So why didn't Jimmy Savelle of the BBC caught
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.200]  with all these kids? He should have said he was teaching them a civil right. Well, actually,
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.920]  that's what NAMBLA says, and the UN supports NAMBLA. So, again, if you don't turn your
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.760]  kids over, folks, you are a bigot, go ahead.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.320]  Well, and this is what, when you bring up Aldous Huxley in The Brave New World, I mean,
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.720]  he called this out how long ago? I mean, it's following this-
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.420]  32. Right, now his brother Julian Huxley was head
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.920]  of UNESCO. You talk about the UN pushing this. Well, here his brother was part of the education-
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:09.180]  His brother started it. Yeah, so I mean, we see how this was all called out so many years
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.800]  ago, and we're seeing it come to fruition now. The hypersexualization of the children,
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.480]  the breakdown of the family, like you're saying, where you can't even say the word mother and
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.020]  father. I mean, it's right out of the book. See, first they say don't say the N-word.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.400]  We agree that that's really mean, but people have the right to say it. Now they're arresting
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.960]  you if you do. Next, it's, I mean, I heard a guy say, hey, let's go get Chinese food.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.340]  Two Hispanics and a white guy, and they go, don't say Chinese. Pretty soon, up and down
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.240]  is racist. Now, that's Orwellian. It's reducing the
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.320]  language down to where we can't communicate properly. Words are bad.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.160]  Anyways, I'm ranting, go over that. Well, I think what you guys are observing is that
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.900]  there's an agenda. There's an agenda to dissolve the family. Brave New World is more like a
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:53.520]  business plan. It was written as fiction, but that's how they get the plan out there.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.080]  He said again in 62, as you know, in Brave New World Revisited, he said this is a real
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.760]  plan. And in The Ultimate Revolution, he's talking
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.360]  about how to control human resources. So you have a eugenics agenda that starts with T.A.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.240]  Chuxley, who was Darwin's bulldog. So this all ties back up to you, Jesse. He was in
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.360]  a secret breeding program. And he was also in the X Club. So there's
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:16.120]  also secret societies and intellectual intelligentsia that are making their momentum known through
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.700]  culture. And these are guys with 100 nanny-ac huge.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.000]  They are poly-masks, and they have a lot of office supplies, as I like to say. So they're
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.640]  well-staffed, they're organized, and we need to catch up to them in every way, doing our
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.800]  research and history. So break them down.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.320]  Well, Brave New World is trying to make the world asexual, where you have adults that
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.780]  no longer are bred with parents. That's how the book starts out. You're walking through
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:40.680]  this room of test tube babies, and the government, the state is their parent. And so how do they
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.880]  get from where we were in America to Brave New World? That's the process we're going
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.680]  through right now. You get it where the state supplies children
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.500]  to the gay and lesbian couples that want kids. Right.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:56.020]  And you abort most of the kids so that there's a shortage. And they have actuaries all on
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.720]  that. It's all planned out is what's incredible. Well, when your listeners go to the Infowars
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.720]  store and get the state of mind, the psychology and control, we have a long clip in there
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:09.440]  where Aldous Huxley is actually going through and describing the world we're living in today.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:13.680]  It was a Mike Wallace interview in 1953, and describes it perfectly, even the pharmacological
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.420]  control of the anti-authoritarian personality, which is so prominent now within psychology
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.720]  in this country.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.520]  Well, incredible. They create cognitive dissonance, and then they pathologize our descent to the
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.680]  contradictions that we see. And that's what-
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.680]  Explain that in layman's terms. They present us with contradictory information.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.000]  So if you watch cartel media, you're going to see a bunch of opposing stories that don't
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.320]  make sense. That creates cognitive dissonance, the attempting of two facts to reconcile as
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.480]  one. Makes you shut down.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.140]  Right. And so people sometimes get upset about that. And so that descent is then pathologized
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.720]  by our education system. And they say, give that kid some SSRIs so that he-
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.720]  They admit, and then the SSRIs cause more mental illness. So then now the answer is
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:57.240]  more drugs. Then it causes more mass shootings. The answer is more drugs.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.720]  I can't help but notice that a lot of the pharmaceutical interests who funded MK Ultra
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:06.640]  and all these pharmaceuticals today, the SSRIs, are very close to an LSD derivative.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.080]  So it's very much like LSD without the trippiness.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.760]  Well, they're actually listed as in the hallucination class.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.760]  Right, exactly.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.760]  Well, and then you use the tax-free foundations to fund, okay, we'll give you your hospital
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.240]  millions of dollars, but you need to push all of these drugs. And this is how they're
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240]  behaving.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.520]  Well, that's another credible thing that I found out. After leaving the corporate world,
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.280]  you see all this information on the internet and it says the Rockefellers are bad, but
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.800]  there's not really a lot of credible information. When you get into the primary sources, there's
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.460]  a book called Rockefeller Medicine Men. And basically what it shows is, along with the
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:40.160]  education system and along with the foundations, they were also in the medical establishments.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.640]  They were funding eugenics and they're funding Cold Spring Harbor. They're funding the Nazis.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.400]  I mean, there's definitely a lot of credible history that is not very much talked about.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.760]  They took over the entire private charity hospital program.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.600]  Exactly, and so that's another problem. Posing is charity, posing is philanthropy, going
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:01.580]  around asking people for money and people think these are great activities. But as Norman
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:05.920]  Dodd showed in the Rees Committee, the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Foundations were
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.120]  bent on dissolving America's boundaries, denationalizing it. They're internationalists, they're globalists,
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120]  they're collectivists.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.200]  Their ideas of how philosophy work in the world are antithetical to American philosophy
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.280]  of reality that we own ourselves. We have a right to our own private property and we
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.320]  will not be collectivized.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.000]  And again, once they have standardized and patented all the genes, they're saying they'll
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.680]  have to pre-certify, they're already saying this, embryos to decide if you can have that
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.800]  child. Because under collectivist healthcare, while we're all not gonna pay for your bad
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.560]  genes, never telling you it's the chemicals in the environment and things they've added
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.080]  that are triggering the genes.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.320]  And this goes back to the early parts of eugenics where you were gonna have to go in and get
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:50.240]  a license to have a child. And if you had bad genes in your family, you'd be denied.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.880]  It was outrage after the National Socialist experiment, but we've come full circle here,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.160]  and we're coming back at it again.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.640]  You guys, I'm sure, have seen our videos and Mark Dice's videos, where we go out and 90
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:06.360]  plus percent of people say, arrest everyone that wants freedom, confiscate all the guns,
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:12.080]  put conservatives in FEMA camps. Now, we go to trendy areas, but these so-called liberals
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.440]  are not liberals at all.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.720]  They're like empty buckets that have had propaganda poured in.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.320]  Stimulus reaction, what you're noticing is you're encountering human beings who, when
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.000]  you ask them a question or make some assertions, say, I've seen all of Dice's videos and they're
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.680]  hysterical because at the same time, they're sad that our culture-
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.600]  He always says, for Obama. So they support it cuz-
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  Authority.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.640]  He means he's good, he's liberal. So we're gonna put everybody in a death camp for Obama.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.480]  Well, certainly, let me, we're gonna kill him, get death camp. Yes, ma'am.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.400]  In condition in school to accept authority unquestionably.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.640]  And it does help, he's like six foot four. Now, I mean, they tell you in sales, if a
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.920]  guy's tall, people just do whatever they say. Of course, not me, I must have a Napoleon
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.720]  complex cuz I'll beat their ass, excuse me. I apologize for talking like that, not Mark's,
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.360]  but you know what I mean. Some big guy gets in my face.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:06.000]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:08.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.840]  a war on for your mind. Richard Grove, who is a forensic historian, and James Lane, both
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.380]  filmmakers are in studio and they know their stuff. This is a short segment, long segment
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.640]  coming up. We'll go to some calls, play some clips, premiered here on the air of the film
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:28.840]  that's released July 17th on Infowars Nightly News. But gentlemen, in essence, what is the
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.480]  New World Order? What is their master goal? And how are things going for them?
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.440]  I would give an example of a book called The Molecular Vision of Life by Lily Kay, who
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.200]  is an MIT professor. And it's about Rockefeller Caltech and the rebranding of eugenics as
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.440]  molecular biology to take control of human resources. And they had to rebrand it because
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.880]  they were involved with the Nazis, and because of the Nazi regime, eugenics got such a-
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.160]  And we have that book.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.080]  Right, right, exactly. And so in the Infowars store, you can find this book, you can get
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.940]  into it, and you can start to read through and get this real history because it's, A,
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.760]  I had a hard time finding the book when I first found out about it. So it's a resource
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.580]  that you're going to have, and you can read and reread because it's so much more credible
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:15.200]  than a tertiary source. This is an MIT professor that has accolades on the back from some very
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.700]  famous scientists in our history.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.800]  And so the fact that people like that support her-
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.420]  You don't get in the club. Again, my dad was top of his class in Texas. They brought him
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.240]  in as a high schooler and told him all this. And of course, he didn't go along with it.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.000]  I mean, go ahead.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.600]  Well the idea is that they're rebranding our culture. So they're taking us away from being
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.280]  self-reliant individuals, and they're trying to collectivize us at the same time. So that's
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.880]  a mind game. At the same time, they have eugenics going on, which is a physical reality game
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.920]  that they're playing with us.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.880]  What they want to paint with the world is very much the Brave New World vision of no
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.580]  parents in the future, depopulation, everything's automated. And the people who don't choose
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.760]  the automation, they live in the woods like animals, and they're not even treated as people.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.520]  So there's really an ego complex at the heart of this. I think the people that do this lack
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.540]  love and satisfaction.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:08.380]  They're creating an artificial habitat construct in their own words, so it's impossible for
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.320]  us to survive without them, the final revolution.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.280]  It's a physical and a mental terrarium that they create that we have to learn how to escape.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.480]  And you're a slave until you find out that that exists.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.840]  What's incredible is they've written hundreds of books admitting it, and they're doing it,
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.600]  and they're total criminals. I mean, it's not debatable.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.120]  And it's actually trying to get people down to the level to where dissent is completely
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.520]  removed from the equation. Now, like you said, there's no mulligans, there's no do-overs
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.840]  on this. This is why it's so important to get involved and get this information out.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.480]  Well, and like the guy riding with chalk in front of the bank, and it's gonna be 10 years
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:44.480]  of a kid wearing a t-shirt, 13 years in prison.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.360]  Right, so this is ludicrous. People should recognize that the piece of-
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.960]  This is hardcore authoritarianism. Stalin would send you away for 10 years for worse
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.000]  free speech stuff. I mean, this is Stalin.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.240]  I once did an episode on the Gulag archipelago, and I was going through Solzhenitsyn's work.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:04.480]  And I really just, I was horrified by the parallels that I was noticing. And it's like,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.720]  if only people had read this book, maybe America wouldn't even be where they are right now.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.240]  I read his book 20 years ago, and I reread it about three years ago. I'm gonna be honest
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:18.080]  with you, I cried on my back porch, because we'd already gotten like 80% there.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.920]  But we're not all the way there, and that's the hope.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.760]  Well, it's different. Russia never had a free press. So there's like these vestigial islands
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:29.560]  of liberty left in the sea of tyranny. So it's like a parallel. There's like both worlds
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.640]  together now, and they're trying to dissolve the old let us out. Yeah.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.600]  Well, and all this, I think, compounds onto what Bruce Levine talks about in the movie,
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.040]  learned helplessness. Everywhere somebody turns, it seems like they're powerless, they
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.920]  can't do anything, and eventually they give up.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.960]  There was experiments with dogs where they kept getting a shock no matter what they did.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.000]  And eventually, they would open the cage or whatever, and they just surrendered. And this
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.040]  is, I think, one of the major elements that we as a free society have to overcome is this
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.480]  learned helplessness. I think that's the major tool that they use through a dynamic means
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.640]  of methods.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.960]  We just have to realize we're not dogs, that if we can realize that situation, we can choose
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.280]  to outgrow that status quo. That's why they're always telling us we don't have free will.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.060]  But even top physicists have gone out and done the research and found, no, there really
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:20.880]  is free will. That's what makes us human, is controlling our environment and realizing
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.020]  that we can make choices about what we wanna be.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:28.720]  They know that they're trying to build an artificial construct to remove those choices.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.000]  They do know that, that is the modus operandi of all their operations. And Hegel said, the
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.360]  true nature of an individual is to be free. And as soon as they discovered that, they're
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.960]  like, wow, government's gonna be obsolete if everyone figures that out. We better try
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  to put the lid on the jar here and keep all these fleas in and train them and break them
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960]  down.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.320]  And if they're the humanitarians, they're the opposite.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.680]  You're talking about the ganglion dialectic, the problem reaction solution, and I know
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.920]  your listeners are familiar with that. We actually interviewed Kurt Haskell in the film
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:01.040]  as a real world example of the ganglion dialectic at play. He was a witness there of the underwear
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.520]  bomber, you know the story.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.520]  Government run, yeah.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.520]  And then here comes Chertoff, who actually has financial interest in the naked body scanners,
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.640]  you know, pushing that after the fact.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:15.600]  They'd already been built, they were being delivered the next week. It was all segwayed
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.600]  as perfect PR.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.800]  Well, and that's another thing I learned after I left the corporate world that shocked me.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.600]  And it's illustrated in a book like Trevor Arison's Terror Factory, where FBI makes these
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.960]  terror, you know, 14 out of 22 in past 9-11 have been made by the FBI, according to the
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.960]  New York Times.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:33.080]  And look at him on Salon, you know, I mean, he just said, they're giving me explosives
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.600]  to give these guys, then he goes into witness relocation and we'd never heard from again.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.680]  CBS actually ran the tapes where the FBI handler is saying yes.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.720]  Well, he said, they told him, give him real explosives. He said, no, I'm not.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.080]  They go, yes, you are. And detonators. And then stood down and let them bomb the building.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.560]  We'll be right back, gentlemen.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:30:02.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:42.420]  all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.860]  to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:53.860]  All right, I know we got callers across the board holding. I'm going to get to you with
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:59.480]  our guest, but these filmmakers have done their research. They really know deeply what
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:06.300]  they're talking about and within this knowledge is the future. We cannot just turn the world
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:11.860]  over to globalists that are busily dumbing everybody down so they can take over the planet
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:16.260]  because from my research, once they have full control, they're going to reduce the population
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:20.580]  in their own words between 80 and 90 plus percent.
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:24.620]  And some of their documents show even more, but they don't tell their own minions that
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:29.940]  they give them numbers where they think that it's going to be only 80% or so. And the people
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:34.540]  that are part of this really get on power trips that they've been let in on this. I
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:39.660]  mean, if you talk to any biology department head at a major university, if you talk to
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:47.180]  any head of computer science or nanotech, if you talk to anybody at any major university,
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:52.020]  I mean, I had that big professor on yesterday, the head of their computer science research
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.840]  nanotech cybernetics department.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.100]  And he said, yes, I work with Ray Kurzweil. Yes, I work with all these people. And I looked
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.060]  it up, he's on record working with them all. And he goes, yes, it is true that most of
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.840]  the establishment is just planning to get rid of everybody. So I think we should have
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:12.220]  a debate about this. I mean, that's the thing, folks, this is what you're hearing here for
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:16.820]  the PhDs and people that work in academia, they'll sit there and go, well, there are
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:21.020]  too many people, aren't there?
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:28.020]  Here in Austin, Texas has the Austin head of Agenda 21 here admitting that depopulation
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.540]  is part of their agenda?
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:34.820]  Actually, one of our reporters went out, was it John Banner, Melissa Milton? I mean, we've
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.420]  got that bombshell interview where there's two of them. And you go talk to the professor,
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:44.180]  the head of the UT agenda 21 program, was that you? It was you and Melissa, that's why
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:46.600]  I was confused who it was.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.660]  And he just goes, yeah, that is part of the plan. And then he starts going, look at my
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:55.340]  plaque from the CIA, I'm a made man, baby.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.460]  Yeah, well, I mean, they're joking with themselves. And I don't think we should believe their
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:03.180]  jokes anymore. And people take it seriously that overpopulation is a real fact. But if
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:08.940]  you study the numbers, Western countries aren't keeping up with the death rate. And so we're
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.940]  underpopulating.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.460]  We have 1.3 children.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.220]  And you need two people to replace two people. So that's the problem.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:18.820]  And that's why, and we've already been replaced by predominantly Latin America, which is fine
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:23.760]  with me as long as we get them to be free minds and not programmed by the globalists.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.540]  So I tell the Latin Americans, what do you mean open up the border more so you win in
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:33.540]  La Raza, La Reconquista? See, the globalists sell a racial-based deal. But only when it's
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:37.420]  being used to destroy a nation-state, it's not even really a racial-based deal.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.420]  More divide and conquer.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.420]  Well, more divide and conquer.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:44.980]  And the other idea is that what you have today is the technotronic era, the post-industrial
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:49.900]  world. They created a bubble when they created the industrialized world. They needed overpopulation
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:53.820]  to an extent to create all this technology so that they could harness humans, build robots
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:56.020]  and get rid of the rest of us, because that's part of their bigger-
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.180]  They call this the technotronic bloom, and you're talking about Brzezinski's book.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:04.900]  Right, and so I got into Brzezinski not because of his political ideas, but because of his
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:08.780]  work on cybernetics. And if you look at any of his books and you go to the index and look
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:12.240]  up the word cybernetics, he's gonna tell you how the collection of information is being
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.540]  used to collectivize individuals and control people socially.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:20.220]  And it's a form of cybernetics, which comes from a Greek word, kybernetes, which means
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:26.860]  governor or helmsman. It's about the art of ruling nations, the art of ruling many individuals
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:30.600]  to de-individualize them and collectivize them, collect their information, predict their
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.980]  behavior and control and monopolize the markets.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:37.820]  But this is a cybernetic towards our end, not towards our empowerment. Can you imagine
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:42.260]  if we had altruists and people that really wanted to go to the stars? We'd already be
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:45.100]  there. I mean, these people, but they wanna go back to feudalism.
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:48.380]  Well, I think also the priorities are messed up. Why are we going to other planets if we
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.540]  can't figure out how to work out problems without using violence on this planet? If
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.780]  our governments and the way the world is being run, it's through force, fraud, coercion and
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:57.780]  aggression.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.660]  Why do we wanna spread that to other planets? Shouldn't we just figure some stuff out here
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:04.340]  and shouldn't we maybe allocate some of the resources that we're using for our insecurity
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:10.100]  as a defense budget? It's our insecurity budget. Shouldn't we take some of that funding and
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:14.420]  maybe do some stuff for people in this country whose families worked hard and paid into those
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:15.420]  funds instead of-
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.640]  But if you empower people, you've got to compete with them.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.900]  That's a problem for people who are lazy, people who have been born into some sort of
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.180]  trust fund world where they didn't have to work for their money. There's a lot of other
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:29.380]  honest, hardworking people out in the world who are getting screwed because they do not
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:31.980]  know that there are predators, there are sharks out there.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:36.100]  There are dishonest people, there are con men, and you have to be able to discern fact
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:40.260]  from fiction and people lie using words. So you have to parse the words that individuals
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.260]  use-
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:47.220]  How do you think it's going, Richard Grove and James Lane, for them right now?
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:50.740]  I think they're on the fence and they really don't even know it because so many people
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:54.780]  are waking up that we didn't even intend to wake up because of what's going on. There's
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:59.900]  just an accumulation of momentum, the grovelment of what's going on as far as getting on people's
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.540]  radar to say, wait, that's that's idiocracy.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:05.760]  That's supposed to be a fictional movie. It's going on in our reality. Things are getting
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.340]  just a little too crazy. It's getting just a little bit too close to a dystopian-
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:14.580]  Isn't it the human survival instinct is overriding even globalist programming?
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:17.820]  And so much information is coming out now. I mean, you look at the NSA deal. We were
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:23.720]  talking about this before. In 96, we're talking about carnivore echelon. In 2006, Mark Klein
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.220]  broke the deal about the NARA systems at the AT&T communication hubs were pulling off petabytes
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:30.820]  of data a month just in one regional hub.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:35.180]  And he tried to talk to people about that and they're like, again, conspiracy theorists.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:39.020]  But now it's out in the mainstream news that, yes, NSA is monitoring all of your emails,
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.460]  your phone calls. And now they're starting to recognize that. I think that in combination
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:47.900]  with as this information, this worldview, the true view of world history is starting
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.820]  to become more prominent.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:53.100]  We're approaching critical mass and I think they're scrambling. They're reverting to a
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:57.700]  more overt physical level of control now because I think they're afraid.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:02.780]  Well, you know, George Arwell and Huxley, as you know, had had a debate in letters before
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:10.340]  he died in 49 about whose book would be more accurate. Would it be a 1984 dominant system
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.860]  or would it be a Brave New World Huxley system?
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:20.300]  And Huxley, as you know, bragged, well, it's my system of pharmakeia and dehumanization
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:27.780]  to where they don't even know they're slaves that will win. And he somewhat convinced Orwell,
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.780]  but maybe Orwell was right.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:32.900]  Well, I think we're actually living currently living in an amalgam of the two. Yeah, Orwell
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:40.140]  was a student of Huxley and Huxley's grandfather taught H.G. Wells. So you see an ominous continuity
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:44.420]  of Fabian socialism, of the use of science fiction to create these agendas that-
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:47.580]  No, it was a five family interbreeding program on record.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.540]  Right, with the Wedgewoods and so-
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.060]  The Galtons, yeah.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:55.460]  Yeah, so they've been studying us for a long time. They've been studying the animal world
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:00.700]  as well to try to figure out, to crack the nut of the human spirit, to crush our spirit,
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:04.420]  to make us submit. That's the game on the planet thus far, is there are people in control
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:07.020]  who use force, fraud, and coercion, and they try to make us submit.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.540]  These are the most uncool people.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:12.300]  And I say, don't give them the satisfaction. Why do they deserve our submission? Why? What
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.740]  have they done to earn it?
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.500]  And they said we would love our servitude.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:20.180]  Well, they said that, but I don't know if they can do that if we're still using reason
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.180]  and-
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:26.500]  Well, as soon as they say we're gonna teach your five year old how to have brutal sex
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.380]  acts, if we tell them it's civil rights, it's okay.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:33.380]  Jocelyn elders, I mean, these types of things. What Isherby brings up in the-
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.540]  A creepy old woman talking about helping five year olds masturbate. And the reason I bring
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:41.140]  that up is these are crazy people. I mean, you're not supposed to be thinking about stuff
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:42.140]  like that.
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:49.020]  Well, another thing that we bring up in State of Mind is propaganda and how Bernays actually
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:52.980]  changed the language. It's not the Department of War, it's the Department of Defense, as
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:57.260]  you brought up in the film. It's changing the words, changing the language. And every
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:03.860]  time that we actually cut them off, they step back and repackage it and come at us again.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:07.220]  It's no longer a real idea, it's the-
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.860]  It's no longer a war, it's a kinetic action.
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:14.340]  And now he came out, the fiction writer who's 30 years old, they've hired at the Pentagon
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:20.640]  to do all this writing. He came out and said, this is a violent, nonviolent aid we're giving
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640]  the Syrian rebels.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.220]  His brother's the president of CBS, right?
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.220]  Yeah.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.720]  Talking about Rhodes. So here's a guy who I was like, how does this guy have qualifications
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.260]  to be a deputy national security advisor? I think that was his official title.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.260]  Yeah, 30 years old fiction writer.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:36.460]  Yeah, that's where we're at in America right now. And I think we need to wake up from that
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:37.460]  American dream.
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:45.300]  Well, I mean, they literally write fiction. And people believe it. So fiction is made
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:49.380]  out of declarative sentences. We have to question that, is that really real? Is there a basis
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:53.340]  in reality? Are they talking about things that exist? Are they talking about some nebulous,
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:56.060]  ambiguous, particular that's not defined?
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:00.460]  And so it's by observing, identifying, defining our terms, removing contradictions and communicating
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:04.660]  that we get back to reality and express knowledge and wisdom to each other instead of having
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:05.700]  divide and conquer.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:09.460]  And circumventing the media where they're getting this fiction just handed to them and
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:13.900]  talking like this is reality and giving that as news, getting that straight from the government
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:17.340]  or corporations. We're becoming the media.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:22.340]  Rachel Maddow, Rhodes scholar, says with a straight face, Alex Jones says there's giant
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:26.940]  wasp under the UN building. He actually says that. He's crazy. It's time to not listen
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:32.100]  to him. That is, I never talked about giant wasp. That is a 100% lie. And then she told
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:36.780]  like five other lies, literally preying on her audience.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:42.060]  Folks, Rhodes scholars are dedicated to worldwide eugenics, worldwide evil, and the end of the
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:44.220]  family and tell them what Rhodes scholars.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:45.820]  Okay, so in the-
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.980]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.980]  Yeah, there's the Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley, a 1966 textbook that had its plates
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:56.940]  destroyed and they reprinted only the second half of the book as a history of the world
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:02.580]  since 1939. And so what Quigley does in this book, when you get the whole uncensored copy,
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.920]  which this is an uncensored copy that includes all the pages that were censored out of the
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.820]  other versions, there is an agenda.
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:12.760]  There is a plan. Names are named. Quigley had access to the official CFR, Pilgrim Society,
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.740]  all these different Anglo-American establishment resources and archives. And he was able to
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:20.500]  map out the Rothschild family, the CFR, all these different working groups and what their
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.340]  agenda is, tracing it back to the last will and testament of Cecil John Rhodes, who founded
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.580]  the Beers, diamonds and gold.
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.780]  And he said, I'm gonna set up a British covert worldwide empire.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:34.540]  And he was funded directly by Lord Rothschild and his will and the Rhodes Scholar Trust
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:38.420]  in the Sir Anthony Kenny book talking about the history of the Rhodes Trust. It says it
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.980]  goes back to the Rothschilds.
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:43.300]  And who runs all the major congressional publications?
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:48.440]  The Rothschild banking empire, Roll Call, Congressional Quarterly, I believe The Economist,
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.420]  and they also helped to found the London School of Economics, a Fabian socialist institution.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:55.740]  So really symbol is a wolf in sheep's clothing, right?
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:59.500]  Yeah, absolutely. So these people, if you just look at their symbols, you can tell what
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:02.260]  they're up to. But they expect that people won't read that people won't look at these
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.300]  things that people just will not use their five senses and their observation skills.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:10.500]  And they're God given creativity and their inspiration and their imagination to figure
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.740]  out like there's a bunch of odd confusing pieces that were presented with every day.
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:16.980]  How do these things fit together? And which of these things are lies that deceive us?
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.020]  And where's the truth that I need to focus on to survive?
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:23.660]  Well, one thing that we did when we went to CPAC, Ron Paul won the straw poll the second
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:29.200]  time. And everybody was very intent on being there and actually cheer for him. The time
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.420]  before they all left and so a lot of the more establishment Republicans said we're booing.
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:39.400]  And so we go there and I recorded it. And when I watched the Fox News clip, it shows
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.400]  the booing.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.780]  And the guy had on a different shirt and a lanyard from the year before. Now, how in
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:47.980]  the world does that actually get put in from last year's archive get put in that?
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.180]  On purpose, psychological warfare.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:53.500]  And so we put that, it is a psy-op. And so we actually put together the videos side by
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:58.140]  side and showed everybody cheering. It was overwhelming applause and cheers. And they're
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.380]  asking Ron Paul, he's like, well, how did you feel when you got booed a second time
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380]  basically?
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:06.740]  And Fox News actually had to issue a retraction because I think there was three different
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:11.220]  videos out there that actually got the information out and it embarrassed them. And that's what
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.220]  we have to do.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:17.340]  Listen, I've had people go, my gosh, Bloomberg called me and asked questions and they actually
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:21.560]  misquoted me on purpose. They lied to me and said it wasn't a hit piece. And I said, of
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.000]  course they did.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.860]  It was such a hit piece. I mean, that that disturbed me when I read that because they-
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:28.500]  Said Alex Jones is gonna blow everything up, yeah.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:32.100]  It says that you make bombers and the tweet that I put out is, no, the FBI, according
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:36.220]  to the New York Times, the FBI makes bombers. That's on record. There's nothing on record
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:39.180]  that you've ever made a bomber, that you've ever influenced anyone to take violence.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:41.660]  Listen, I'm trying to stop violence and everybody knows that.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.660]  Right.
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:45.780]  And people are asking me, cuz I live in Oklahoma with the tornadoes and everything. They're
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:50.460]  like, did Alex say that Obama used weather weapons to create the tornadoes? No, you just
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.060]  brought up the point that there was patents on-
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.460]  Technology exists from our tax dollars.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.820]  And so then they take everything you say out of context. Again, this is-
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:03.300]  I got called by Esquire cuz they got a big cover story coming out on me. And the guy
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:06.580]  said, did you really say that? And I said, you know what, I'm not even gonna defend it.
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:09.580]  I said, okay, I'll look up the YouTube where I said it. You know what, I said, you know
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.100]  what, I'm not even gonna look up what I said.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:15.780]  Write whatever you want. You know what, go ahead and say I did that. Because I don't
[01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:21.820]  care. I didn't say that. A lady called up and said, I think that they made this tornado
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:26.460]  do this. And I said, no, it's mainly big hurricanes and weather systems. This is all patented,
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:28.020]  so I can't say they did it.
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:32.300]  But it's on record that this weather warfare stuff exists. And Matt Al, in between saying
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:35.980]  I believe giant wasps live in places, went with that and so did a bunch of other national
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:39.220]  TV. That's what they've gotta do, folks, is lie to you.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:42.820]  And I think that's a sign of weakness because the reason that Maude has to do that and never
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:46.820]  address your point is because she treats her audience like they're a bunch of idiots. And
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:50.760]  she, her arguments are intellectually bankrupt. She never addresses any of the facts. She
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.380]  attacks you as a messenger, which is a fallacy.
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:54.580]  And you must be effective or they wouldn't be doing this.
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:58.860]  Well, sure, but I mean, my point is saying I don't build bombers, I build bombs. I mean,
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:03.380]  I don't build bombs, I build bombers saying that I believe giant wasps live under the
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:07.060]  UN building. I mean, they're really lying about me all over the place. What do you think
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:13.380]  that signifies? Weakness, desperation, unprepared for these types of things coming onto their
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.380]  radar.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.820]  Because when the Rhodes Scholars were founded, there was no social media or Internet or any
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:21.460]  things. Their agenda has stayed the same through and they're trying to adapt and evolve. And
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:25.140]  it shows, again, that they're intellectually bankrupt, that they have no reason. They're
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:28.060]  acting irrational and I think we should just call them out on it.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:31.920]  And free humanity is adaptable and we're taking the tools that were meant to enslave us and
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:35.420]  using it to fight them. And that's what some of the most effective tools that we've got
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.420]  right now.
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:39.100]  We've got this network break as we're so far behind and I promise to go to some calls.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:43.780]  But let's go to this clip here. The elite versus individuals from the film available
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:53.500]  at Infowarsstore.com. State of mind, here it is.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:49:00.220]  In an attempt to assist the state, a 14th century Italian named Nicolo Machiavelli crafted
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:05.460]  several books intended to help the ruling elite dominate their subjects with the most
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:11.380]  effective psychological warfare techniques available to the world at that time.
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:17.700]  And he was trying to convert the Medici family into hiring him to provide political advice.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.820]  Conspiracy is the story of history. It's the story of plunderers taking care of people
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:24.680]  who produce. They claim to take care of them through government, which doesn't give you
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.700]  anything that doesn't take away first. So it's not creating something out of nothing.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:31.740]  It's very real what they're doing. They're taking your rights or taking some people's
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.900]  rights and adding more to someone else's rights.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:39.420]  Concurrent to Machiavelli's efforts, the consequences of tyranny were sowing the seeds of liberty
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:45.620]  throughout Europe, with authors like Etienne de Labouette of France leading individuals
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:52.300]  to consider their situations and discover effective means to achieving liberty for all.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:56.900]  So this whole idea of Machiavelli telling the ruling elite how to do this in a more
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:03.060]  efficient and effective manner without people directly knowing about it. But his mistake
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:05.980]  is that these books get out there and other people start to read these books because it's
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:10.180]  not just the ruling elite. This starts to have an influence in Europe. You've got a
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:16.460]  character named Etienne de Labouette who writes a discourse on voluntary servitude. And basically
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:20.620]  what de Labouette does is he shows you that everything Machiavelli told the ruling elite
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:26.220]  about how to control you is undone when you understand it to the nuts and bolts level
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:30.840]  where you can then withdraw your consent and that only then are you free.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:37.900]  We control you. We control your mind. We make you believe you have no creative power. We
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:44.300]  make you forget you have imagination, which is the core capability from which you can
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:47.540]  invent your own reality.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:51.080]  That's right. Whatever humans envision, look at science fiction of a hundred years ago,
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.880]  we can build. So they program us with predictive programming with a nightmare vision. So we
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:01.100]  accept that as our future instead of us just simply having imagination. And that just means
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:05.700]  looking deeper into what they're doing. And Machiavelli, just like the head of Georgetown
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:10.420]  political science, Bill Clinton's mentor, he wanted to write a weapons technology book
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.360]  on Sigh War, Infowar.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:18.100]  And basically what Machiavelli did 500 years ago, Carol Quigley did in the 60s with Tragedy
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:19.100]  and Hope.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:21.900]  Well, and it's not the only book that Quigley wrote. There's Anglo American establishment,
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:25.940]  evolution of civilizations, and there is one on political weapons and future technology.
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:30.100]  And so basically what you're seeing is he was taking in a macrocosm of how history has
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.380]  worked and how these civilizations have risen and fallen. And then he's basically showing
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:36.420]  you, okay, now here's the 20th century.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:40.300]  Here's the Anglo American establishment. Here's these people going off an agenda that's funded
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:45.480]  by the world's largest financiers. And they are moving ahead without much resistance through
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:49.580]  much of the 20th century. They're able to turn our education system into a system of
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:53.300]  schooling, not to make individuals who know how to learn anything for themselves, but
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:57.300]  to make obedient, servile workers in the tradition of the Prussian education system.
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:02.620]  I talk to a lot of adults and there is no one home. They don't have any original thoughts,
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:07.380]  they just repeat. And there's no one there. They've ruined these people.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:11.620]  But it doesn't end there. I mean, they try to extinguish our creativity in the schooling
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:15.300]  system, but there's always a spark that can be reignited when people come into contact-
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:19.220]  I agree, but people love their ignorance. It's a shield for them.
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:22.900]  Well, it's become a trophy. It's become something that people are kind of proud of. So if they
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:25.360]  can know that- Well, that's the new trendiness, that being
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:30.340]  lazy and not being informed is like a shield. Well, as you brought up on your show many
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:32.340]  times about- That's learned helplessness, so just give it
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:34.820]  up. Yeah, exactly. And you talked about the food,
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:40.620]  right? Everybody's malnourished at this point. The food is horrible. They're overworked.
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:46.060]  They're in debt. Everything that they see in media is, the predictor programming is
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:52.540]  all dystopic. And by the time they get home, they're exhausted. They don't do the research.
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:55.220]  It's a dynamic effect that's just dragging their entire conscious.
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.900]  Yeah, because people don't say conspiracy theorists now. They go, what am I going to
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:04.300]  do? And what you're going to do is start living better, start being happy. Go paint a painting.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:08.940]  Be nice to your family. But also speak out. When you see kids buying a gun that has aspartame,
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:13.020]  go, hey, you know that aspartame will brain damage you. Here's a card with some info on
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:17.760]  it. Yeah, that's all it takes. That act of fighting back, if we all do little stuff,
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:23.140]  it's game over, folks. If everybody gets this film and has a party and shows it to 10 friends,
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:27.840]  game over. If you get my magazine and get the 10 free bumper stickers that are in it,
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.820]  game over. It's all about resistance is victory. And I don't think it's ever going to be just
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:36.300]  the damn breaks and it all just happens. I think it's going to be a slow drip, drip,
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:40.620]  drip of just getting everything out there. I've talked to a lot of top Hollywood people.
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:44.060]  They say, look, most of us are awake to this. It's the old higher ups that want to keep
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:48.540]  us on the reservation. We don't like it. Even the rich and powerful realize they're slaves
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:53.940]  and don't want to be part of this. It is alluring to really be free. It is alluring to have
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:58.960]  the real fire of Prometheus, not the false fire of the Illuminati, where they claim they're
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:02.500]  illuminating you. They're not illuminating anything. You're not illuminated if you have
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:06.420]  knowledge and then try to keep others away from it, right? So that's the whole idea.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:12.060]  The word education and Johnson's dictionary of 1828 said it's the un-occulting, the unhiding
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:16.780]  of information. And very much what our education system focuses on today is selectively presenting
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:20.500]  you with declarative sentences, which is not a form of learning. And what you come out
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.900]  with thinking as knowledge is actually-
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.180]  Our education system is occult.
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:25.180]  Right.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:28.900]  And that doesn't mean witches around pots, folks. Occult means hidden. They are hiding
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:29.980]  the world from you.
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:32.300]  And that's the nature of power. That's the power gap, information gap.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.300]  I hate the occult.
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:34.300]  They're all the same-
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:35.740]  I declare war on the occult.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:38.500]  Well, then we're educators and we're teachers then, right?
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:45.220]  Exactly. The thrill of empowering people is what it's all about. Again, they call it eugenics,
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:49.780]  but that's occult. It's not getting rid of the dumb, building up the smart. It's targeting
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:55.420]  the smart. Again, the definition of eugenics is occult because it's a lying definition.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:59.500]  Well, it's a war on the weakest because they go after our children first. The schooling
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:03.240]  system is definitely not there to educate children and make them autonomous individuals
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.820]  who can be self-responsible adults.
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.700]  It's based on the pressure in the system.
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.700]  Right, which was-
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.300]  It's General Zod. Have you seen Man of Steel?
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:10.300]  No.
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.300]  No.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:15.260]  I mean, it's a total anti-illuminati, anti-eugenics film. And again, how could you get the guys
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:18.960]  that put out The Dark Knight? The last one I said, it's French Revolution. And then later
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.100]  I saw an interview after it came out, they go, oh, Bane's French Revolution. We spent
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:26.440]  a year designing his coat. I mean, I could see it until it was French Revolution, fake
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.440]  Illuminati Revolution.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:31.100]  Well, then why would they put out Superman that's anti-eugenics?
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:35.400]  I think sometimes it's like to measure people's reactions to see how they respond to it. Some
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.380]  of the terrorist events that have happened in this history I think are just this measure.
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:42.520]  What's the patriot response to this? Is anyone gonna pick up on the contradiction in the
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.120]  evidence or is no one home? Is no one reviewing the evidence?
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:52.360]  And so I think as they try to assert control more and more steadily and readily over humanity,
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.840]  people react in different ways and they keep gauging it. They're waiting. They wanna see
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:01.020]  everyone wake up. That's their worst fear. They keep thinking about it. They keep talking
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:03.760]  about it and they know it's gonna happen sooner or later that people are gonna get it.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.960]  And that's what we're talking about, the analogy of trying to hold the ball underwater. As
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.080]  we're inflating it, they're having to hold harder and harder to keep it underwater. It's
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.680]  natural state is to be above water, to be free. And they're struggling now to keep it
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:17.680]  under control.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:20.840]  Unbelievable. Let's go to one more clip before I take a few calls here and I appreciate people
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:27.200]  holding. This is on education from the film State of Mind, exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.720]  It's clip number five and then we'll play clip number seven after that.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:37.920]  So here's a clip number five. And then we'll take some phone calls.
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.960]  Education our children are going to get has nothing to do with education. It is training
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:49.640]  our children to be resources, human resources, that's the way they refer to us, to spin off
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.120]  profits for the globalists.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.280]  The greatest barrier to discovery is not ignorance. It's the illusion of knowledge. And that's
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.560]  what the 15,000 hours in compulsory schooling really in trains and conditions into us is
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:06.680]  that you've been told this story of the people in South America. And so you think you know
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:10.080]  about it. And it's not until later in life when you might come across more information
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.660]  about conquistadors and how Jesuits infiltrated all the religious systems and took all the
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:18.840]  riches out and basically harvested this whole area. And this is the example of plunder in
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:22.860]  South America that went on for hundreds of years. So until you have this other piece
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:26.840]  of information to bring this into focus, you think that what you were taught in public
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:30.960]  schooling during that 15,000 hours is really what's going on. And it's not until you pump
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.160]  up against reality, as George Orwell said, usually on a battlefield, that you have to
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:42.240]  consider that which you were taught to believe versus the objective evidence that exists.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:47.760]  John Taylor Gatto was an award winning educator in New York who took kids that couldn't even
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:55.440]  read or write or headed for prison and made them top level students. And then he discovered
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.900]  that he was shut down by the big tax free foundations so that he couldn't teach the
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:06.320]  children this information. He discovered that it was by design that they were dumbing people
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:13.380]  down to make them subservient biological androids or replicants. That's what we're seen as.
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:19.000]  But now we're obsolete. We're to be phased down. The new robotic systems, the drone aircraft,
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.880]  the drone submarines, the drone ships, the drone robots on the ground are all being conditioned,
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:29.920]  all being acclimated for this state of mind, ladies and gentlemen. And there's a bunch
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.640]  of clips we haven't gotten to. And then there's so many people in this film by Colonel Shafer,
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:43.560]  G. Eber Griffin, you name it, info war store.com. It's key information. You are listening to

[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:06.200]  panic. It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.840]  drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:15.560]  summer. Wonder if there will really be a problem? E Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your

[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:14.680]  mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:31.640]  Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right,
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.360]  triangle segment with our guest. And we've got a bunch of callers here to get to. Then
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.280]  we're going to have more guests in studio. The newest level in censorship by Google.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:48.680]  You want to know about this via Michael Moore who got mad about this video. I mean, he actually
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:52.960]  responded to it and then it's been removed. The person's had their accounts suspended.
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.800]  This is outrageous. And they're now censoring our videos at a record level. They're very
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:01.240]  upset about this broadcast, okay, and everything we're doing. So just understand, it's not
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:04.920]  enough that we're doing this broadcast. You need to get all this info out. Brandon in
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:08.380]  California, thanks for holding. I appreciate you holding so long. You're on the air with
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:13.400]  our guest. Go ahead. Awesome. Good to meet you guys, finally. First time caller, long
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:19.120]  time listener. Alex, I know sometimes when you have people thank you for the things that
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:23.220]  you do, you kind of react with, hey, don't thank me. But my theory with that is it's
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:27.400]  actually people's way of expressing that you're a hero to them. And they really just don't
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:32.360]  make that connection. You know, we look at the solidarity. You guys are heroes to me,
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:39.560]  sitting on hold while I precipitate. And I love your vocabulary too. I'm actually going
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:43.680]  to be a high school English teacher and I'm going to make sure that the assignments the
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:49.660]  kids are given are designed to make them think. That's one thing I've found. This system is
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:54.800]  so centralized, you can basically do whatever you want and they'll never stop you. I just
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.220]  tell teachers, just sabotage the enemy. Explain to the kids about the New World Order and
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:03.440]  that's why they want to put cameras in there and robots in there. Go ahead, sir. Sorry.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.920]  You still got to be careful. But I also wanted to say I'm the creator of the largest private
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:15.160]  group on Planet M4s. I'm known as Free Mind. I'm the creator of the Panopticon. And some
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.580]  of the most wonderful information about the technocracy that's been created in our world
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:24.680]  is available in that group. And we do accept anyone who comes in, but it is by request
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:31.000]  only. And also the creator of the LDS, the Latter Day Saints for Freedom group on there
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.800]  as well. And there's a video that just recently got posted by one of our presidents, Ezra
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.400]  Taft Benson, who is a huge proponent of the Constitution and was warning about all of
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:47.080]  this stuff in the 50s. And he actually told the members of the LDS church that they needed
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:53.080]  to read, none dare call it conspiracy, and consider it equal to scripture. And when I
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:57.040]  heard that, my heart just went through the roof because I'm like, dude, that's the book
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.040]  that woke Alex up.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:03.800]  So basically just, I also wanted to tell you, Alex, that my wife and mother-in-law are,
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:06.120]  they just think you're the manliest man in the world.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.640]  No, please knock it off. God bless you.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:09.640]  You're a manly man.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:10.640]  Oh, I'm a manly man.
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:15.480]  There's not a whole lot of them in the world, man. And I think that's one of the reasons
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:20.320]  why people look up to you so much is because you've got, well, for lack of a better term,
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  you've got a pair.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:25.440]  Well, thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Here's what happens. I mean, if I find a raccoon
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.000]  in my garage and I try to go over and kick it in the face, it's going to attack me. So
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.080]  I don't know. I mean, I don't think it's manly if I'm being attacked to stand up.
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:38.200]  It's natural to resist. It's unnatural to just let this all go on and not be outraged
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.160]  and focus your energy to do something positive.
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.120]  I have psychoanalyzed why I don't like being thanked. I don't feel like I do enough. And
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.480]  I almost feel guilty for the little bit of notoriety I've gotten fighting this because
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:55.040]  that's not what I want. I want to end this. I mean, if we magically turned all this around,
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.040]  I'd be gone.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:58.680]  Well, and you feel like that because there's always so much more to be done. No matter
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.320]  how much you get done in any given day, it's still out there. Not enough people are aware.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:07.180]  And back in the revolutionary times, only a very small part of the population was informed
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:11.840]  about what was going on enough to take action. And we don't need 100% of America to get what's
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:12.840]  going on.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:16.700]  But if we had 10% that really understood what was going on and didn't comply and didn't
[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:20.400]  communicate to other percentages, then we could do something successfully.
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.880]  Well, and the caller says it works in education. State of Mind, I think, is a film that you
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:31.240]  could show to other educators and give them some of the origins of our current education
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:32.240]  system.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:40.080]  Exactly. Reach out to leaders, pastors, rabbis, imams, business owners, teachers, doctors,
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:45.280]  police. That's what they're scared of. Gentlemen, you are going to be interviewed for the Obama
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:50.200]  deception, too. So you guys get some lunch. I want to do quick interviews for that. I
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.160]  want to do a tape for the premiere of the film. And just really impressed. Always enjoy
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:57.680]  hearing you on your own radio shows. I'm really impressed having you in studio with us. God
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:01.280]  bless you. Thank you. You're amazing. God bless you.

[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.840]  in the world on healthcare? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:15.100]  highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:21.320]  one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:27.120]  and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:32.320]  has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving

[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:32.420]  You know, we're on YouTube because that's where the battle for the general public is.
[02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:38.620]  More than half the world's free video views, according to Business Insider and other publications
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:42.880]  on numbers that have been released, are on YouTube. So people say, well, it's their own
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:48.040]  private site, it's free market. If they don't like it, they should be able to ban you. No,
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:53.960]  the terms of service is that it's a public commons, YouTube, you, you and me, you and
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:54.960]  I.
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:01.160]  And as long as you follow their rules, you should be able to be there. But if ABC, CBS,
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:08.400]  NBC, Fox, CNN, BBC show the collateral damage video where they shoot up the Reuters vehicle
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:11.800]  and the little kids, it's just black and white, you can't even really see their bodies. They're
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:14.680]  allowed to show that in the newscast.
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:19.240]  We show it, they banned our account. I had to have lawyers send them letters, everything
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:23.840]  else, and they backed off. But most people don't have the time and energy to do that.
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.880]  I had to swear on an affidavit in federal court just to keep the channel we've got that's
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:35.040]  got 300 something million views. And then on that channel, it was 300 million views,
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.200]  they turned it back to 270 million views.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:42.540]  And then, I mean, it's all sorts of weirdness. And now with World War Z review idea about
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:49.040]  how it's a bunch of pro UN anti-gun owner garbage in the book, which the film is like
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:54.680]  the first few chapters of the book, so they're gonna do a sequel with it. But the first few
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:57.840]  chapters are true to what basically happens in the film, I've seen it.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:02.120]  And another review of that, Man of Steel versus World War Z. And people say, well, why do
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:06.840]  you cover films? Well, we cover them because then that's pop culture. We reach out to people
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.360]  that aren't into politics. That's how we get new people who aren't just in the choir or
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:14.480]  in the Church of Liberty.
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:19.680]  But all over the place, I have seen videos that go viral, they get a half million, million,
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:27.000]  two million views. And YouTube will delete them or YouTube will say parental reasons
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:32.200]  and block them. Mike Adams put out a very funny TSA one that just had him joking around
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.560]  about, it's super awesome to stick our hands on your pants, we're total losers.
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:45.200]  But it was South Parkian and funny, it was going viral, they banned the video, they blocked
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:51.280]  it. So this is the type of stuff that goes on, they really hate humor. And we've had
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:55.840]  over 500 entries and we're going through the last of them. It's the best of times, worst
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.560]  of times for the Paul Revere contest and David Knight's been honchoing a lot of that.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:04.320]  We commend him for that, Infowars Nightly News reporter, guest host here on the broadcast,
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:11.920]  doing a great job. And Telly Leatherface Blackwood is a retired, well-known professional wrestler,
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:16.840]  comedian and he has a great YouTube site or had one with 9 million plus views.
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:23.260]  He did a Paul Revere entry where George Washington comes back and basically gets in the face
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:29.280]  of Michael Moore and others. It's total satire, it's not violent, it's a joke, it's got cartoonish
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:35.120]  waterboarding that they have in real cartoons, mainline TV, everywhere and they banned it.
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:39.820]  And you can still see it on another video site, which is why we always say, do your
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:45.160]  entry on YouTube, but also on another platform, cuz we know how they operate.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:49.360]  But here's the issue, they banned his Google account, his email, everything else. This
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:54.820]  is their plan, they've said, where they're going to take down everything on the web.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:12:00.040]  Their plan is you'll have an internet ID with a thumbprint or face scan to access and you'll
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:04.500]  just suddenly not be able to buy or sell. This is the cashless society and they're gonna
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:08.320]  rack up fines and fees and everything to use the internet.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:13.340]  So it's a corporate global above the law group like Facebook, part of Bilderberg, saying
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:18.740]  they own everything you've ever done on it retroactively. So this is the big combines
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:23.060]  are trying to take over and get rid of the old web and cybersecurity has been built on
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:26.420]  record to help them kill the real web.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:31.180]  Now that's what they've actually said, we've written articles on this. This isn't rhetoric,
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:35.220]  this is what they say they're going to do. Okay, just like we told you a decade ago,
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:41.180]  they're watching you over onboard audio and video on the computers. Now that's all admitted.
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:44.380]  It was admitted then, I had the patents of them admitting it, it wasn't my opinion, but
[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:46.740]  people weren't ready to believe it, okay?
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:50.940]  But I'm telling you folks, this is their plan to kill the free web as we know it. That's
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:55.180]  why Google acts like they're defending the free web, because they're taking it over themselves.
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:58.980]  David Knight, I wanna go to Telly Blackwood, who was censored here. And then we can get
[02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:04.100]  some attention, you can start a new channel, but they make you get a Google email now to
[02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:05.100]  have an account.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.700]  They've made all us do that here, which is a monopoly.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:11.580]  And they won't even talk to him about the issue. I mean, he's got this cryptic message
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:16.860]  that just says, the account has been terminated due to a legal complaint. He tried to contact
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:19.660]  them, he couldn't talk to them because he didn't have a Google-
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:24.100]  No judge, no jury, it's just somebody complained off of your head.
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:27.940]  And you see this happening, CISPA, they came up, right? The whole idea about that was that
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:31.420]  they could file, and they've come at this a number of ways. First, they were coming
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:37.220]  at it with SOPA with a copyright violations where they can just take your entire website
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:38.620]  down immediately.
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:44.960]  But one element of CISPA was to protect these private companies like Google that are turning
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:49.380]  over your information as a third party. They just voluntarily turn it over to the government,
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:52.680]  the government maintains that they don't need to have a search warrant if they get the information
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:54.680]  voluntarily from the third party.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:00.480]  So CISPA was set up to protect them from any legal liability for violating their user agreements.
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.500]  That was a key element of CISPA. They can come in and act capriciously, arbitrarily.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:10.500]  And as you pointed out, they can treat you differently than they treat the major news
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:15.760]  media. Take your website down because of a video that you put up that they allow other
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:18.680]  news organizations to put up.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:24.940]  It's amazing, though, that satire is completely protected. I mean, it's like 13 years in jail
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:30.220]  for chalk in LA, water soluble. And the judge says, you will not bring up First Amendment
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:36.060]  arguments. Telling someone you have no Bill of Rights, that is a serious crime. You can
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:40.240]  look that up. A judge saying, your Bill of Rights is not admissible, he's sworn an oath
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:41.240]  to that.
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:46.900]  Right, right. And satire is, as you said, is very explicitly protected with fair use.
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:53.120]  Why do you think they ban comedies, what they're really scared of? Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:57.340]  Well, I think they like it when people are afraid. We talk about what's happening with
[02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:02.760]  Snowden and the NSA and that sort of thing. People have to know that. We're not trying
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:07.160]  to make people afraid. We're trying to get them to be aware of what's going on, to wake
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.960]  up, to get angry enough to do something about it.
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:13.460]  They're hoping that you're going to be afraid. They're hoping you're going to be intimidated.
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:18.360]  So they're okay when information comes out that intimidates and scares some of the public.
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.780]  But they're not okay about it when you make fun of them, when you point out the emperor
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:25.080]  has no clothes. That's not something that they want to have go out.
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:31.600]  Well, that's what I was basically getting at is that I come at this because I'm angry
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:35.800]  that we're being enslaved and I don't have fear. I have fear of letting them win. And
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:39.760]  I know that sometimes I actually scare people, that's not my goal. People should be scared
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:45.500]  of not getting involved and standing up. I want to go to Telly Blackwood. We have the
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:52.520]  article up on infowars.com right now that actually has the video that is censored.
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:58.440]  It's film contest entrant banned from YouTube. Actually, he's been banned from Google platforms,
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:05.320]  blacklisted and harassed by a stranger. I would just change it to say banned from anonymous
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:11.920]  complaint. But the point is this is going on in the banned videos there. Telly, tell
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:21.320]  us what you think of this. Yeah, he's lost our Skype audio. Telly, can you hear me there,
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.280]  bud? Can we do an audio test with you earlier?
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:31.360]  Okay, fantastic. Why do you think this happened to you?
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:37.200]  I was probably getting the word out very well. Or else there's a couple of actors and show
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:41.840]  hosts that took it personal a little too much. That's right. Michael Moore actually had been
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:47.640]  responding publicly to this video. Yeah, one little response, a quick one with a little
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:50.760]  profane in it and now it's pretty much the end of it.
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:58.320]  And that was on his Facebook, right? Yes. And so now Michael Moore doesn't like it,
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:03.360]  so you don't have free speech? If that's the reason, one thing that was
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:09.760]  always suspicious is I was in process of emailing Infowars, a couple of whistleblowers that
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:15.600]  came to me and I was speaking to you guys. And it was within after one hour after sending
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:21.720]  those emails was I blocked out of my Gmail by morning is when I started getting the weird
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:27.240]  little text and phone calls and I realized I still couldn't get into my Gmail.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:33.240]  But they did send you a YouTube notice that it was due to a legal complaint, a secret
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:38.200]  legal complaint. Well, I had to actually send them a message
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:42.480]  from another Gmail account and just try to get the information out of them for it.
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:44.480]  But they did tell you that that's why that happened.
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:49.240]  Yeah, yeah. Well, once you give them the alternate email address, they'll send you that little
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:53.160]  notice that I sent the screenshot of and that's it.
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.000]  They didn't even notify you, though. You just kind of found out by looking at it that it
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.160]  was gone, right? Yeah, it was just all of a sudden gone.
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:07.880]  What's unusual is usually if there's a music violation or any copyright issues, usually
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:12.520]  a little actually nuclear video or a little block your audio out, then when you log into
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:17.520]  your dashboard, you'll actually get options. It'll actually let you know what's going on.
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:22.600]  Yeah, according to their rules in the public commons, you get to challenge things. But
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:27.840]  no, here, just boom, your Gmail account's gone, everything. This is what, because oh,
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:33.880]  the almighty great man, the self-propelled Jabba the Hutt is probably the one that complained.
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:39.320]  And when the royalty, when his royal highness wants something banned from the internet,
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:41.980]  it's gone. And they don't say anything about copyright
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:46.320]  in the message to you. They just say a legal complaint. And there wasn't anything in there
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.000]  that would have been a copyright violation. Maybe I can do a legal complaint and just
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.680]  come take your house, David. You probably could.
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:56.320]  How about your life? I can plan to execute you. How's that sound?
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:59.440]  Yeah. NDAA, if the president wants to kill US citizens,
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  he can. What's wrong with making him emperor? I mean, Hitler could kill whoever he wanted.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:05.720]  Why can't Obama? That's right.
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:10.560]  Telly, you're now a very serious thought criminal. The video is still available on Vimeo. We
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:15.640]  have it, or Vimeo, on mfallwars.com. Do you think other thought criminals should go out
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:19.480]  there and protest by getting your video out to people that had half a million views? I
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:22.200]  think they were scared at how fast your video was growing.
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:26.680]  Yeah. The fact that it was growing and the fact that I actually managed to get myself
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.760]  into a local press, the Sacramento Bee, which got syndicated nationwide through a bunch
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:36.720]  of different internet sites. The video just traveled beyond just the views. The views
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:41.560]  was a nice thing, but the reach with my articles and other publicity I got off of the video
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:44.360]  was just a blast of the live. Yeah, so let's be clear. You did a video.
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.720]  The reason we did a contest was the first amendment, to get the word out, about George
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:52.960]  Washington. Jabba the Hutt didn't like it, and it was in the news, so now your video's
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:56.960]  gone and your civil rights have been violated, and the video clearly doesn't violate your
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:00.800]  terms of use. We'll be right back as part of the Paul Revere film contest.

[02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:07.360]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:16.880]  By the way folks, Telly Blackwood has been the star on TV shows, you name it, like Dr.
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:22.400]  Quentin Medicine Woman, you name it. He's had a long career on movies, TV, you name
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:27.280]  it. And he's got a popular YouTube channel with over 9 million views. And then he puts
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:31.920]  out a video that makes it in the Sacramento Bee and then a bunch of other papers about
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:36.560]  a joke video against Michael Moore where George Washington's angry at him.
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:40.840]  And Michael Moore on his Facebook, well, you've got a copy of it right there, David. It's
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:46.120]  in our article. Film contest entrant banned. I've changed the headline now actually on
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:52.480]  Infowars to basically what it is. Comedy video banned from YouTube for criticizing Michael
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:56.000]  Moore. And I bet money, it's one of Michael Moore's people.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.480]  He came back and said, you think that's real funny there, a-holes, coming from what looks
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:04.880]  like a group of juvenile delinquents and your conservatives. Very interesting. That was
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:05.880]  his comment.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:09.160]  Yeah, yeah, we're conservatives just because we believe in the Second Amendment. How about
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:15.720]  we're free humans. Stop trying to label us, scumbag. Listen, I've had his people, his
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.480]  bodyguards, like 15 feet from Moore. I'm just like, Mr. Moore, question, come over and run
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:21.920]  into me with their elbow, like hit me in my side.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:27.000]  So I just rammed the guy back. And the guy was all, I'm like, yeah, you go ahead, man.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:31.320]  All of you, come on, let's go. I mean, I am sick of this in this country, a bunch of thugs.
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:33.320]  By the way, his guys are all armed too.
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:34.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:35.800]  Yeah, I mean, what a hypocrite pig.
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:36.800]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:41.780]  I don't mean cuz he's fat. You know, I'm sorry here, Telly, I'm ranting and I appreciate
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:47.100]  you coming on. Are you angry? All your great comedy stuff erased by this, by this maggot,
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:48.800]  this anti free speech maggot?
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:54.120]  Well, first of all, a couple of his bodyguards come up against me and it was gonna be a major,
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:26:00.840]  major issue. And two is, yes, that was my whole history. It wasn't just, you know, my
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:06.060]  current videos, my comedy. It was, you know, appearances with others, you know, celebrities
[02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:08.880]  and actors and different behind the scenes things.
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:14.320]  And it's a lot of videos that we did since the very beginning that are wiped out. I mean,
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.320]  some of them have backed up, but there's a lot of things there that is lost. It's totally
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:19.320]  gone.
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:22.160]  Yeah, you think about it. You put your stuff on Facebook and YouTube and then they kick
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:27.800]  you off, but keep all your stuff and sell it. I mean, I am so sick of them.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:34.040]  Well, look at the massive erasure of stuff from the Kim.com case. They just went in,
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.800]  they haven't even finished the trial. They accused him of having some copyright material
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:43.680]  there. They seized everyone's personal records that were on the cloud, and he pled with them
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:46.640]  to not erase anything until after the trial.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:50.040]  They haven't had the trial, they haven't convicted of anything, but they just deleted all the
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:55.120]  data last week. So it's gone. And it's a lot of that is personal information that is not
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:56.120]  provided stuff.
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:00.420]  Incredible. We got another guest coming in a minute, but I'm gonna hold the guest over
[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:05.480]  so he can finish any points. Telly Blackwood. But again, we have links to your other sites,
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:10.320]  your other video on Infowars.com. It's very important for all the viewers out there to
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:14.320]  go get this video and get it out so that they don't win in this censorship.
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:18.240]  Because as Telly said, this ended up being in newspapers all over the country. This is
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:23.440]  the whole point of the contest is to get the idea of liberty out. And now there's a legal
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.240]  complaint so it's gone. Let's play a few minutes of this censored video for the radio and TV
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:29.240]  audience.
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:36.320]  They got horses, people in outfits, Revolutionary War stuff. This is awesome. Secret location,
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:43.760]  Boston 1778. I'm narrating. How dare them engage in free speech?
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:47.080]  There's a problem, Mr. President.
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:49.040]  What is it, Paul? More red coats?
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.000]  No, sir. It's tyranny.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.080]  My good sir. Where there is government, there is tyranny.
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.440]  Mr. President, it's much worse than that. And let's say distant.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:03.800]  Leave us. Yes, Mr. President.
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:08.640]  Here you are, sir.
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:14.480]  Comedy troops called off the hook, by the way. Oh, man, I tell you, you bring the value
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.080]  to YouTube and then they censor you. They advertise it as a free open commons.
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:21.760]  I want you to go into the future and bring those two horses asses to me.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.280]  But, sir, bring someone back from the future, Ken.
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:29.600]  I understand, old friend, but I don't bend to the wheel of tyrants. Bring them here and
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:32.040]  I will return in the evening.
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:38.520]  So they teleport to the future, bring back the two red coat traders, self-propelled stomach,
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:39.520]  Michael Moore.
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:42.120]  No, he's just seen the pictures.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:43.120]  And here's Morgan.
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:49.480]  Yeah, of course, I have guns. My bodyguards have guns. I should have to deal with this
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:50.480]  stuff all the time.
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:55.560]  Kelly Blaise, Michael Moore, saying this, saying that, hey, fatty, boom, boom.
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:56.560]  Who are you?
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:05.560]  Shoot them with a phaser, send them to the future, or the past.
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:11.680]  CNN special report with Piers Morgan. Totally protected free speech, apparently.
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:13.680]  Hey, red coat.
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:21.280]  Hold on, let's just stop right there. We're going to go to break. Great job. We're going
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.440]  to bring in the next guest, but I'm going to come back and finish up with a Telly Blackwood.
[02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:29.520]  And then we're going to get one of our station general managers in there from Chicago, the
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:32.080]  guy that's been visited by the FEMA Corps people.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:35.200]  So David Knight, thank you so much. We're going to come right back with Telly Blackwood.
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:39.720]  Telly, stay there. I tell you, man, they are so afraid of being made fun of.
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:50.880]  I think everybody should have a contest making fun of Michael Moore. That's it. That's it.
[02:29:50.880 --> 02:30:01.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:06.440]  our own destiny or has it been pre selected for us? As we've moved through history, every
[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:11.900]  great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of dollars have been
[02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:19.600]  spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:25.400]  education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:30.020]  to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop between
[02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:34.400]  you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:39.200]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:45.160]  opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war. Oh

[02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:19.600]  Blackwood is an accomplished actor in movies, big TV shows, you name it. He's also been
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:24.120]  a national wrestler and we're going to be talking to Matt Dubielle here in a minute
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:31.440]  about his little visit with FEMA and more. He's down there visiting us from 1530wckg.com
[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:35.720]  up in Chicago. He's the general manager up there and we're honored to have him with us.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:41.960]  But I've been ranting here. It's just so clear that Michael Moore gets upset, publicly comments
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:49.280]  about this video, part of the mfallwars.com film Paul Revere contest. And then it gets
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:55.200]  in the Sacramento Bee. It gets in a bunch of other newspapers. The video, every day
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:58.400]  getting hundreds of thousands of views, they could see this was going to get millions.
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:03.000]  It had a half a million or more when they killed it. It was like 600 and something thousand.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:09.280]  And then they just kill the video. In fact, the last time you looked at it, Kelly Blackwood,
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:14.080]  the maker of the film and who plays Jabba the Hutt in it, how many views did it have
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:17.360]  when they killed it?
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:24.320]  I believe it had 533,000k last time I looked at it yesterday morning. It's been locked
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:29.360]  up for a couple of days, so I'm sure the numbers are about to flip as soon as it happens.
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:35.680]  So look, I believe it was Michael Moore probably or not. It was the red coat, Piers Morgan.
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:39.360]  So I guess they don't just dislike the Second Amendment here.
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:43.520]  Yeah, they don't like the first as well, obviously.
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:46.560]  Absolutely. So they don't like the second. They don't like the first as well. I think
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:50.720]  I said that backwards. So, I mean, what do you think is going on here?
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:56.880]  I think it's just another meaningless censorship with all the whistleblowers coming out and
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:02.400]  people exercising their rights and speaking out and waking up. Like you said before, you
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:08.640]  want comedy, laughter travels and comedy travels. So I used that to go ahead and bring people
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:12.240]  in and slap the truth on them as soon as they were done laughing.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.720]  I think this is going to backfire. I would contact the local paper and others and point
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:23.740]  out now that your video got removed so they can contact the YouTube people and ask why
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:30.400]  they're doing this and find out who made this legal complaint. Because if they can shut
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:36.080]  down anybody's work and part of their livelihood, then they could do this to anybody.
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:40.280]  Yeah, they got me in the loop-the-loop route when I was trying to get into the Gmail for
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:46.680]  access and recover YouTube or try to see what was going on. They did try blocking me on
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:56.160]  all that pretty much. The more worrisome thing is not having no due process or no chance
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.840]  to even explain myself or see who's doing what or where. A lot of people hate and dislike
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:06.160]  your videos. I've heard before people flagging your video a couple of times and your video's
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:12.300]  gone or something happens. But just come here and say, oh, we got a complaint. Goodbye,
[02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:17.680]  you're gone. And without no notice or explanation is ridiculous.
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:22.320]  Well that shows that they thought it was pretty important whoever threatened them. And the
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:26.880]  way he acts with his bodyguards with all their firearms and everything, I mean, this guy
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:31.860]  is really a monster. And I'm glad you point out the hypocrisy of the fact that he has
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:35.960]  armed bodyguards, six of them, but he doesn't want you to be able to have a gun to protect
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:36.960]  yourself.
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:39.760]  He says get a dog, Telly.
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:41.960]  He is a dog. And two, I don't see why he's-
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:44.960]  Don't insult dogs. I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry.
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:49.880]  Sorry, dogs. But I don't see why he needs bodyguards anyway. I mean, Lady Gaga or Madonna
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:54.120]  or someone like that, yeah. But if I see him on the street, I wouldn't want his autograph
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.440]  or get near his little pudgy face anyway, so.
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:04.120]  I tell you, what would you like to say to ManBearPig? I mean, I don't know, that's Al
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:11.040]  Gore. What would you like to say to the anti-First Amendment, anti-Second Amendment creature?
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.840]  I would say you are living in the wrong country, that you and your other little globalist pals,
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:21.680]  including peers, need to all hop on a little ship and sail off somewhere. I won't say where,
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.240]  but you need to sail off somewhere.
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:27.160]  They say that's why he's so obese, though. He supports the UN population reduction programs.
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:31.360]  It's just from going to third world countries and eating children. I'm joking, folks. He
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:32.560]  doesn't actually eat children.
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:38.160]  Well, he should have been the star of Man vs. Food. The other guy, for sure.
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:44.160]  I'm sorry. It's mean. But seriously, I mean, I'm surprised you're not even more angry and
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:48.040]  making a joke out of it. They took your site with over nine million views?
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:55.000]  Yeah, yeah, I'm very angry. My main angry point was the first half hour to hour of making
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  the discovery. I've been up all night pretty angry and doing everything I can to try to
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  figure out.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.040]  You're supposed to get three strikes, but they violated their own policy.
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:11.240]  No, and my material over the years, it was a little edgy and I've gotten warnings before,
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:15.320]  but my account, I've been a YouTube partner for a long time. My account has been clear
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:19.800]  from anything for forever. I mean, like I said, when you get violations, they just either
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.480]  take your video down, send you a little message in your dashboard or you're messing up and
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:30.960]  you can protest, you can, you know, you know, test it or whatever. Sometimes you can't and
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:32.880]  you say, OK, and agree, then you move on.
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:40.480]  You know, I think everybody should recreate your video and or like waterboard a cat box
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:49.360]  and say it's him or just everything, because if he doesn't like satire in America, he should
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:50.360]  leave the North Korea.
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:54.840]  I don't think you'd eat very well there.
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:39:01.120]  Well, they probably actually eat him. That's the U.N. food aid program in North Korea.
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:05.160]  He should. He says there's too many people. He should. He should probably go over there
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.880]  and sacrifice himself so that thousands could eat.
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.440]  He's so full of GMO and crap. I don't think they would want to eat him anyway.
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:18.920]  Oh, man, I got to be honest. I think I think I think he and Mr. Maddow are very handsome
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:27.320]  men. I'm going to be honest. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I meant Janet Reno. Mr. Reno. I guess
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:31.560]  I'm involved in more thought crimes here. It's OK, though, and they're always attacking
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:35.840]  everybody. Seriously, anything else you'd like to say? Thought criminal, Telly Blackwood
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:39.600]  websites, other things they haven't deleted yet that you'd like to be able to give out
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.640]  to other thought criminals out there.
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:47.320]  There isn't much less. They took my Twitter, which was at fifty thousand followers recently
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.160]  this past month. It's down to eighteen hundred. I sit there and watch it over a one week period,
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:57.860]  dropping numbers after a brief argument over gun control with a Twitter rep regarding my
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:39:59.040]  ads on him.
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:04.280]  Oh, yeah, that's what they do. Oh, yeah. Twitter. We've got notices McBreen to his own private
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:08.160]  Facebook. It's like high school friends and stuff. Hey, don't send out this pro second
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:12.600]  amendment thing. That's not how you gain friends. We'll we'll terminate you next time. We get
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:16.760]  a whole story on that. And now everybody's getting these notices or they're just suspending
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:17.760]  you.
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:21.940]  If you say, you know, I believe in the Second Amendment or I believe in national sovereignty,
[02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:26.120]  they're deleting you. I mean, who needs the communist Chinese when you've got man bear
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:29.480]  pig and Al Gore and all these people?
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:37.200]  Well, I have my Facebook account left. That's pretty much it. But my final words are you
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:41.600]  can take my Twitter, my videos, my stardom, I had in the past or my movies. I'm going
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:45.200]  to take all that from me. But you're not going to take my soul. My soul is going to fight
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.840]  you to the end for this now.
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:50.280]  Oh, so you're only going to intensify your efforts against them now.
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:54.480]  Oh, it's not as war is done. There was I'm the wrong person to do that.
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:57.400]  Why don't you just offer to have yourself drop into a wood chipper and turn yourself
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.600]  into a hamburger made for for Michael Moore to eat you?
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:07.240]  I don't know. I think the other way around would be more appropriate. I am leather face,
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:08.240]  right?
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:13.600]  Well, listen, listen, in closing, that's the fighting spirit. Every time they attack us,
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:18.040]  I just work harder. And now I think this will backfire on them. What does your gut tell
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:19.040]  you, Telly?
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:25.360]  Oh, my God, is this keep pushing, keep pushing, not giving up, pushing forward and give them
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:27.480]  enough rope, they'll hang themselves every time.
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:29.360]  All right. Give us your Facebook thought criminal.
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.360]  Say one more time I can hear you cut out.
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:38.280]  What is your Facebook page thought criminal before that's fully erased?
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:44.160]  It should be Facebook com slash leather face or Telly leather face Blackwood.
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:47.040]  All right. Thank you so much, sir. We'll talk to you soon.
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:48.040]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:51.200]  You know, we'll get updates from the nightly news. At least the reason this is a big deal,
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:57.040]  and I make jokes about it, it's actually deadly serious, is that Mike Adams did a very tame
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:02.720]  but also funny thing about the TSA saying they were losers and they took that down.
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.120]  And then we put it up and they took it down and we put it up again and then they blocked
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:11.560]  it. I mean, these are authoritarians prancing around saying they're liberals, they're the
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:13.160]  opposite of liberals.
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.200]  We're joined by Matt Dubiel, a good friend of mine, is the vice president and general
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.200]  manager of W.C.K.G. radio in Chicago. He's a broadcast and new media expert who's worked
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:26.680]  with celebrities across the board. I'm going to get into all of it here from Donny Osmond
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:32.080]  been featured in Fast Company magazine and Chicago magazine most recently.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:35.960]  He's made national headlines on Drudge and Fox and Friends, Inside Edition, CNN for the
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:40.440]  criticism over the TSA screening of his three year old son on a family trip to Disneyland
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:47.200]  who's disabled, special needs. And again, his W.C.K.G. carries the Alex Jones show,
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:55.320]  afternoon drive one to four on W.C.K.G., we're on right now, 1530wckg.com and mattdubiel.com.
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:59.600]  Matt, number one, thanks for having us on in Chicago. Thanks for all you do. I want
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:01.400]  to get into FEMA Corps visiting your house.
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:06.740]  But first off, your latest viral video, what do you make of Telly Blackwood? Can't even
[02:43:06.740 --> 02:43:12.120]  have his his tame video up there making jokes because somebody doesn't like it.
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:18.360]  I think I would love to see him in a cage match with Michael Moore. Where's Vince McMahon?
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.240]  Let's get it happening. Let's do it now. And let's let's see him really take it to the
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:29.280]  mat. I think the reason or the symptom of this is highlights the importance of two things,
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:31.560]  AM radio and your magazine.
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:35.920]  The Internet's great. Your website's great. All the things that you do online are great,
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:39.440]  but they could be shut down like that. And what happens if they're shut down? What happens
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:43.700]  if the IPs are scrambled from the domains? And all of a sudden, what happens if somebody
[02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:47.220]  can't go to infowars.com and it doesn't go to the right place?
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:52.200]  What happens if Google shuts you down? You are so powerful and this message is so powerful
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:58.280]  because of these tools on the Internet. But this, if I get this in my home, if that gets
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:02.880]  shut down, I still have this. I still have a conduit. My power was out the other day.
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:07.560]  You're talking about Infowars magazine. Infowars magazine, yes. Infowars magazine or AM radio
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:13.320]  shows. I know you're on the FM. No, no, no, no, no. That's why, and AM. That's why you're
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:15.880]  right. We need to keep old media more than ever.
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:20.480]  Yeah, and it's flawed. And there are problems with it. And yes, it's going away. And yes,
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:23.320]  the future is digital. But it's real diversity. We need to keep it.
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.240]  What happens when they shut down your Facebook? What happens when they shut down?
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:34.520]  And what happens to the old local real journalist once those AM and FM stations are gone? Again,
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:37.520]  it's not making places for diversity in real media.
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:41.480]  But I'm reminded, there was a movie, it might have been in the 90s or the early 2000s, Enemy
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:46.920]  of the State with Will Smith, where they shut off his credit. Totally should be happy that
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:53.640]  today they're attacking his Twitter and today his Google's being attacked. What if he didn't
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:58.320]  exist? That's how he feels right now. His voice is shut up. And it's happening to him
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:44:59.320]  cuz he spoke out.
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:04.960]  But what happens to the regular folks all of a sudden when they can't buy or sell or
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:10.000]  do business or they're shut off because of the Internet? Because some arbitrary company
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:14.360]  or conglomerate has control. That's happening to him. And it's gonna happen to me and you
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  and others at some point. The best thing they can do is duplicate that video over and over
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:19.360]  again, like you said.
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:23.620]  Have other accounts duplicate it. And I'll tell you what I like is how ManCal has gone
[02:45:23.620 --> 02:45:29.960]  back and done a daily TV show that's now getting really high ratings, simulcasting the radio
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:35.560]  show that you carry in Chicago. And now he's doing a show on history. But the point is
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:37.200]  he's doing a bunch of stuff.
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:43.080]  That's what you've got to do is use the old media. Because if you go to old UHFVHF-TV
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:47.640]  and put a good show on, people will go tune into it. That's one reason old media has been
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:53.400]  in trouble is because they're going with the establishment model. The only thing that sells
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:55.720]  in AM and FM is liberty.
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:01.000]  Well, yeah, regular television, you got Judge Mathis on UHF and VHF. And that is the old
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.320]  model. I just put an antenna on my house to get HD cuz all the storms coming through,
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:09.120]  which is why FEMA came by, and my TV, my dishes get knocked out. So I thought, well, hell,
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:10.600]  I'm gonna put an antenna up.
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:16.080]  You know what all the antenna stations are? All Chinese foreign language programming,
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:19.560]  all Russian foreign language programming. I don't know what they're saying, but they're
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:23.160]  getting their message out and they're doing it on traditional television. They're doing
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:26.560]  it in publications and periodicals like Infowars Magazine.
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:30.200]  It's a niche and there's advertising, I've read the trades, they're making a ton of money
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  too.
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:35.300]  Well, and it's important, if I were listening right now, I would make sure that if there's
[02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:39.760]  a radio station in your hometown that you can get the Alex Jones show on that you know
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:43.960]  what it is. So if you can't get it online, you got it. Because I'll tell you what, my
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:47.040]  power went out the other day, I went to look up phone numbers.
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:51.140]  I didn't have power. I didn't have a phone book. All of a sudden we were paralyzed. So
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:55.980]  imagine being cut off because you don't have power, you don't have internet, your accounts
[02:46:55.980 --> 02:46:56.980]  are shut down.
[02:46:56.980 --> 02:47:01.320]  How are you gonna get this information on the regular radio? Is there a station near
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:05.680]  you? And I'd get that magazine because it's sent to your house. You know you're gonna
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.040]  get it and at least you have a conduit to get to the-
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.480]  Well, plus there's less and less paper. People really pay attention to hard copy things now.
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:15.400]  That's why it's important to have books, DVDs, films.
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:20.760]  It's good to have an archive of this because they can now go into YouTube and claim Joe
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:25.360]  Rogan's voice as copyright, even though he didn't authorize this, and block everybody
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:30.620]  that ever interviewed him. It didn't just happen to Infowars. Until he went and found
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:35.120]  out who was doing it and was like, no, no, you don't own my voice, you owned a recording
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.120]  I did.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:41.320]  But they had the computer set it to where it could say that his voice was owned and
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:47.020]  they've done the same thing to me. A company bought rights to distribute my film Endgame
[02:47:47.020 --> 02:47:53.480]  in Canada. A limited distributorship. Soon, my own account, other people's account was
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:59.760]  blocked. They said they owned my voice on that tape.
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:07.040]  It's scary. And when you think about it, they can go through, another example is the Kindle
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:11.580]  with 1984. They can edit history, they can edit a book. Anybody can do it with a push
[02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:16.960]  of a button. So if you have archives of regular books, classics, if you have archives of periodicals
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:19.720]  that you like, and you have a way to get that information, it's important.
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:27.080]  Well, last time, Matt, I mentioned this on air. Callers are like, I can still get 1984
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:33.320]  on Kindle. I think it was 60 something thousand people four years ago had it erased off their
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:37.460]  thing by design. There was a backlash, so they put it back on. But the point is there
[02:48:37.460 --> 02:48:39.400]  needs to be a backlash each time.
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:43.280]  They brag that they hope that we just get used to being censored and finally just give
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:44.960]  up. No, we've got to fight.
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:48.220]  Well, what happens when they change the words? If they can go and find everything with Joe
[02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:52.380]  Rogan's voice on it, they can go in and take a word they don't like. You mentioned some
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:57.520]  words earlier. All of a sudden, well, we don't like this word, homosexual. Okay, you take
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:00.400]  that word out and you replace it with something else. All of a sudden, history is-
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.960]  They're trying to ban To Kill a Mockingbird, this total anti-racism film, because it has
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:09.600]  the N-word in it. I mean, are they gonna ban The Godfather because it has it in there?
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.200]  They're showing racism. It's showing it in the context.
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:17.440]  Yes, Alex, as an Italian-American wearing a pinstripe suit from Chicago, I'm offended
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.600]  by The Godfather. I demand they take all references to Italians that are derogatory out immediately.
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:24.760]  By the way, I like the pinstripe suit.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:25.760]  Thanks.
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:30.720]  Man, I tell you, so how are listeners liking the show now up in Chicago?
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:35.580]  You know, they love it. We have it on. We used to have you on opposite rush and we shifted
[02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:39.520]  it so you're on in afternoons. It's nice because it's mindless drivel. You know what they're
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:44.260]  talking about in Chicago right now? They're talking about Paula Deen. They're talking
[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:48.380]  about the Trayvon case. In fact, I flipped around on the way in and Rush was talking
[02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:49.380]  about Trayvon.
[02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:54.620]  I was so happy to find, is it 90.1 here in Austin? And boom, it's like, okay, nobody's
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:59.180]  talking about the immigration bill yesterday. They're all talking about the Kardashians
[02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:05.280]  and all of this other stuff. Meanwhile, we have this radio station that surrounds Chicago.
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:09.960]  And you're talking about things that if people would open their eyes and wake up, they're
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:16.680]  things that matter and really affect their lives. Smart meters in Naperville, the FEMA
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:19.560]  Homeland Security going door to door.
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:25.240]  Hello, come in. I mean, you could have knocked me over with a feather when we got a phone
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:30.460]  call from a neighbor saying, there's some guy that looks a little weird coming door
[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:36.120]  to door says he's from FEMA. And thank God the wives are talking in the neighborhood.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:38.600]  That's another thing you got to do is you got to talk to your neighbors to figure out
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:39.600]  what's going on.
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:43.880]  Yeah, they want you inside watching a glowing television screen instead of communicating
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:52.160]  with people. Absolutely. Matt Dubiel is our guest. 1530wckg.com is the site. And they

[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:07.300]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:12.980]  us destructive storms 24 hours before a storm strikes people panic, it would be wise to
[02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:18.560]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:22.880]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:27.840]  be a problem. E foods direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you

[02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:10.000]  I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.160]  to work because it continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:20.100]  and depleted after only three weeks on one world way. I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping
[02:53:20.100 --> 02:53:25.560]  normally again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product. It is a little
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:29.660]  known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein
[02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:35.200]  content as glutathione but due to toxicity and aging, it does not could glutathione be
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:39.840]  a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body. If you restore the optimal
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:44.120]  glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result,
[02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:48.200]  your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement you might
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:57.520]  have. To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.

[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:22.960]  Matt Dubiel is our guest. We did a little bit of overdrive with him as well. Audio streams
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:28.240]  at mfallwars.com and we were talking during the break about getting me up to Chicago.
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:33.640]  As soon as I'm done with Obama Deception 2 in the fall, I am going to, because I promised
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:38.480]  to do it, I am going to start probably doing one event every two months and I want to go
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:43.160]  to Chicago. I want to go to Southern California. I want to go to New York because we're on
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.300]  several affiliates that go into New York, like five or six affiliates in the state of
[02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:51.480]  New York but one of them, as Bloomberg pulled their hair out, covers New York City. They
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:57.120]  can't stand that. And I want to go to Florida. I want to go back up to Dallas again. I mean,
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:01.520]  I want to do all this and I need to do it. Plus, I want to do some events. The problem
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:04.840]  is getting a place to do it and having it be free. You got to pay for the sound system,
[02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:08.660]  pay for all the people. I don't want to charge $500 a ticket like Glenn Beck's like I'm flying
[02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:12.360]  on a private jet. Maybe I've been doing it wrong the whole time. Maybe that is the answer.
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:16.480]  But the whole issue is we'll have to end up charging something to these things, 10, 20
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:21.000]  bucks because the cost of all this stuff is so prohibitive. But I want to have some big
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.280]  free event somewhere where, I mean, I guarantee you, if I had something in Central Park or
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:28.960]  something and I promote it for a few months, we could get 50,000 people out.
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:32.840]  And I want to show the media that. I didn't even really get any shots of the thousands
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:38.560]  of people at Bilderberg, but the media did, of either giving a speech there in the countryside
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:44.240]  an hour northwest of London. That just shows, Matt, that freedom's becoming popular.
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:51.160]  Yeah, you're not nervous about any of this. I mean, when you look at the kill list, the
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.680]  Clinton kill list, the Obama kill list, all the people that have kind of disappeared.
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:00.560]  The idea of leaving here and going around doesn't frighten you or going to Bilderberg.
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:04.720]  Well, I don't want to give them any ideas. When I go jog into the woods by myself, everybody
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:11.080]  knows where I go. The system knows. I mean, I don't want to die, but I'm above them. And
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:16.240]  I know they're doing bad. And if they kill me, they kill me. My whole issue is I know
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:22.160]  I'm doing the right thing. And I've done such a big body of work that if they kill me, it'll
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:26.200]  really supercharge everything we've done. I don't want that to happen, and I think I'll
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:30.040]  be more effective living. But I mean, this is always the big topic with everybody, because
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:33.960]  they see the kill list. They're like, why are you still alive? You must be an agent
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:39.360]  or something, which, well, if I'm an agent, we need more like it.
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:43.080]  What do you think? Why do you think I'm still alive?
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.920]  I think you're not out much. I mean, aside from your daily life, you aren't stumping
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:52.800]  and traveling around the country. That would, for me, if I was your security guy talking
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:57.040]  into the arm piece all the time, I'd be like, no, keep him out. I don't, not just because
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:58.520]  of- Yeah, we have nuts that say they're going
[02:56:58.520 --> 02:56:59.520]  to kill me.
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:05.040]  It's nutty people, and then it's this confrontation, just the negative of you save something that
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:09.560]  offends one little micro group. Even though they agree with you, 99% of the other stuff,
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:12.520]  you said one word that offended them. And now they're all-
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.600]  Well, they also make stuff up. I mean, it's freaky when people are saying, I'm this, this,
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:20.480]  and that, and they're really like, you can tell they've got mental problems, and they've
[02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:23.720]  made it all about me. But I just can't live in fear of those people.
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:27.000]  No, it's true, and you're a stronger man than I am.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.800]  No, no, I'm not. Anyways, you put me on the radio in Chicago twice a day.
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:38.280]  Well, you know what? The alternative is doo wop music, oldies, classic rock, more sports.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:42.800]  I mean, you listen to the radio, and there's nothing on. That's why the Internet is so
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:47.360]  popular. That's why alternative media is so important. If you had an event in Central
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.800]  Park and 50,000 people showed up, they did one, and they did a tea party thing in Chicago,
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:57.840]  and I think Man Cow was there. Crickets, Channel 2, Channel 5, Channel 7, Channel 9, Channel
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:02.560]  3, Fox, none of them showed it. Or they showed it, they filmed it in a way where it looked
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:03.720]  like three people were there.
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:08.320]  But here's the deal. Now we do this. We show how we have 5,000 out for a gun rally. The
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:12.840]  media shows three people. And then we show their lie. That's why they're losing, that's
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:13.840]  why they're falling apart.
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:14.840]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.340]  Cuz they're not running these scams where they dub in booing over Ron Paul at CPAC.
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:22.440]  They're not doing this in a vacuum. And by the way, if you want to sponsor the show in
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:26.480]  Chicago, that's not why he's here, but this guy's done a lot for freedom. Be sure and

[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:37.200]  Alright, I'm going to go to Alex and Regina and Tom, and I really apologize for making
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:40.120]  you all so long. I think you create a rule that I haven't gone to somebody in an hour,
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:43.720]  and you just hang up on them. We're going to do 20 more minutes of overdrive. Matt Dubiel's
[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:47.480]  here. We're going to get into FEMA visiting his house. We're going to get into his TSA
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:51.700]  run-ins, the anxiety he's having about wanting to take his kids on a vacation, but not wanting
[03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:54.720]  to go through being yelled at when you're like, you're not going to stick your hands
[03:00:54.720 --> 03:00:58.800]  on my kid's pants, or making his kid, his son, who's in a wheelchair, get up out of
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:01.980]  it. I mean, it's amazing. So we're going to talk about that in the next segment with him.
[03:01:01.980 --> 03:01:06.480]  But right now, let's go to Regina in Texas, who's been holding here on the air. Go ahead,
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:07.480]  Regina.
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:12.320]  Oh, hi, Alex. I'm a first-time caller, and I just wanted to let you know what we're doing
[03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:16.720]  in Dallas, and that we are listening to you, and we're trying to get the truth out and
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:21.720]  trying to get more activism going. We rented a theater, and we showed Freedom to Fascism
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:27.240]  about a month ago, and there was a lot of new people there that knew nothing about this.
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:32.120]  And then we piggybacked on that, and we got a hold of Joe Bannister and Sherry Jackson
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:37.520]  from the movie, and Tom Selgus, and we're actually flying them in and having an event
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:44.080]  this Saturday at Pastor Broden's Church, which is Fair Park Bible Fellowship Church, at five
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:51.480]  o'clock until nine o'clock. And it's at 1321 Rowan in Dallas, and this isn't just going
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:55.740]  to be like a one-time event. We're going to, in two more months or so, we're going to have
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:58.600]  Joe back and some other speakers along this path.
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:02.400]  It's beautiful, I mean, and again, everyone getting a local radio show, everyone getting
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:06.800]  an access show, everyone starting a YouTube channel to get trained, to show a program
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:11.000]  director, hey, here's my YouTube talk show. And if you can just basically talk, and you'll
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:15.480]  come work for free, most stations will give you a slot on the weekend, next you're getting
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:18.440]  sponsors, next you're getting paid to spread liberty.
[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:22.720]  I mean, how easy is it on AM and FM stations? I don't think that people understand that
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:27.320]  if you can prove you can talk and aren't a crazy person with a podcast you've done for
[03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:30.280]  a year or something, that you can get on major stations.
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:36.740]  You can, and it's harder in big cities like Dallas and Houston and Chicago, but you can
[03:02:36.740 --> 03:02:41.260]  also buy time. And people panic when they hear that, but you could buy time on a Saturday
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:45.800]  and Sunday on some of these stations for pennies. And if you get some-
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:46.800]  How much for-
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:47.800]  You pay for it.
[03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:50.440]  How much for an hour show? I mean, if you've got a little bit of talent.
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:55.200]  Well, I'll give you two examples. WLS in Chicago is the biggest AM station in the country.
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:03:00.180]  They charge between $3,500 and five grand for an hour, right? But then there's other
[03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:03.800]  stations around the country where you can get an hour for 100 bucks on the weekend.
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:09.400]  And exactly, and then let's say you've got a restaurant at the corner of whatever, you
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:14.040]  go, by the way, I'm also an evil American entrepreneur providing service. We've got
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:19.280]  great hamburgers, great steaks, come on by. And once a week we have a liberty meeting.
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:23.320]  And then you'll make the money back from $100 an hour you're doing, and then now you could
[03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:27.440]  say we're gonna have a gun rally. Now, that's one way to do it. They have all these theaters
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:31.480]  actually started in Austin, where you can book it because of projectors. They're in
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:35.840]  the film cost, get whatever movie you want in, liberty movies, you name it.
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:39.680]  And then once enough people buy the tickets, just cuz you promote it, it books and pays
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:44.120]  and then you get paid to have an event at the theater. And then see, just like what
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:46.840]  this lady's talking about. Is that what you're talking about, Regina?
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:52.200]  Yeah, that's what we did. It was the Inwood Theater. It was only $400 to rent it. And
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:57.640]  we had the people come for free and got their feedback and then got their email and then
[03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:00.040]  we invited them to the next thing.
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:04.160]  See I would charge, I would charge, so you pay back.
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:05.160]  You're evil.
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:06.400]  But no, but that way you can expand.
[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:11.120]  Of course, no, of course, I'm kidding. I mean, there's this new culture. It's like nonprofit
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:17.040]  is hip and God forbid you try and pay your bills and even-
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:21.500]  Exactly, I've seen rich people go out and buy 10,000 copies of a book to give to people.
[03:04:21.500 --> 03:04:27.360]  It's great. I see shoestring folks give all their money to rent something, put it on,
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:31.300]  but then you can't do it over and over again. No, charge a moderate amount, not 500 bucks
[03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:35.080]  like other people do. Charge enough to pay for it and make a little money to pay for
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:36.080]  the next one.
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:37.080]  Yeah, she's amazing.
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:40.840]  Yeah, good job, Regina. Good to hear from you. Alex, Tom, we're gonna get to you and
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:48.640]  then get to your FEMA story and your TSA dread. Trade ahead with Matt Dubiel, 1530wckg.com.

[03:07:10.160 --> 03:07:16.200]  but a very big thank you for heart and body extract. I've been on the formula for nearly
[03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:22.680]  a month now and the improvement in the circulation of my legs has been simply amazing. Reid was
[03:07:22.680 --> 03:07:29.920]  facing a tough choice. I was facing surgery due to the severity of the 100% blocked arteries
[03:07:29.920 --> 03:07:37.720]  in both my legs and my decision waiting for surgery to say no and try heart and body extract
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:44.680]  instead has been thankfully the right decision. And the result? I can now walk up steps without
[03:07:44.680 --> 03:07:57.720]  noticeable pain. Order heart and body extract at 866-295-5305, 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.

[03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:12.120]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[03:08:12.120 --> 03:08:19.920]  network. Yeah, Michael Moore criticized the video that was criticizing him. Now it's been
[03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:26.400]  taken down off YouTube, but we've got a copy of it up on mfallwars.com. Also CIA plans
[03:08:26.400 --> 03:08:31.840]  August offensive in Syria with their al-Qaeda buddies. I guess I'm anti-American. I don't
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:37.560]  support al-Qaeda. Sorry. UK bans thought criminals for criticizing extremes of Islam. Again now
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:42.880]  you don't criticize al-Qaeda or you are banned from England. Michael Hastings told he would
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:48.800]  be hunted down and killed by the army over McChrystal story. That's a big report. That's
[03:08:48.800 --> 03:08:55.280]  the family coming out now and friends. Drone spies on sunbathing woman. St. Louis police
[03:08:55.280 --> 03:09:00.480]  chief wants drone to patrol high crime areas. That article is up on drugsreport.com. The
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:04.980]  public doesn't believe the NSA knows what they're doing. I mean, talk about in denial.
[03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:08.980]  That's just some of the articles up on mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com. I want to go to Alex
[03:09:08.980 --> 03:09:14.360]  and Tom real quick and then finish up with Matt who's here with us from 1530wckg.com,
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:20.520]  our great affiliate in Chicago. And if you're in Chicago listening to us, I mean, you should
[03:09:20.520 --> 03:09:25.440]  organize with the station like a bunch of placards and volunteers. Somebody that says
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:30.920]  they'll go out every day for an hour, say when I'm on and stay tuned to 1530 in your
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:35.720]  main listing area. And I guarantee you that will convert massive listenership as well.
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:38.440]  Let's go ahead and go to Alex in North Carolina. Go ahead.
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:45.560]  Hey, how you doing, buddy? I'm all right. Hey, first time caller. Been listening to
[03:09:45.560 --> 03:09:51.640]  you about 30 days. And it's crazy because about 25 years ago, my mom had all these books.
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:56.320]  She's kind of mysterious. She doesn't really get out of the house much. I'm just this average
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:10:03.280]  kid, 15 years old. And I come across some of her stuff and it's about the Illuminati,
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:09.480]  all this junk. So my mom goes, oh, well, you need to read this. And at first I'm like,
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:15.360]  whoa, this is way too much. This is crazy. Over the years, I would take information.
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:20.160]  I would watch the news. I'd look at backtrack things. I say, wait a minute. It's like a
[03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:27.240]  thousand pieces of a puzzle was thrown up before. Now, on top of that, I started to
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:31.040]  put some of this together and I started telling my friends, hey, man, check this out. Isn't
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:36.560]  this crazy? And backtrack this. Oh, whoa, whoa, how did your mom know that? And some
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:39.960]  people would say, I'm like, you're crazy, Alex. What are you talking about? But then
[03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:44.720]  now we're talking about in today's times with technology, how fast people, it's like they
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:47.480]  can't keep up and there's so much stuff spewing out.
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:51.740]  That's right, they can't say we're crazy anymore. Matt, what do you think's gonna happen as
[03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:57.000]  just more and more people realize, wow, we really were lied to?
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  I'm shocked at how many people seemingly don't care. They're just happy to kind of keep going
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:09.520]  on with the day and I gotta do the same 15 things I do every day. I see there's a growing
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:15.480]  amount of people. For instance, the YouTube video, my son going through the TSA, just
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:21.520]  rigmarole from years ago. The comments in the beginning were both sides, people attacking
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:23.760]  me, people attacking the TSA and so on.
[03:11:23.760 --> 03:11:29.120]  And today as I look at it, I see more and more people sort of saying, wow, this is unbelievable.
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:35.060]  There's less attacking of me for taking the video or for thinking that it's wrong or it
[03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:39.960]  shouldn't be that way. So I think that there's always gonna be a most people aren't going
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:45.960]  to be awake and prepared and taking notice of the things going around them. And the goal
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:49.420]  obviously is to increase the amount of people that are just kind of paying attention a little
[03:11:49.420 --> 03:11:50.420]  bit more.
[03:11:50.420 --> 03:11:54.600]  And I think those are mostly younger people. I think those are mostly people under 30,
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:12:00.440]  under 20 ideally, and young folks. That's why, my father, we're standing in the line
[03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:04.840]  of TSA just for his birthday and I was railing. I was like, look at this, this is ridiculous.
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:09.480]  And he says, that's just the way it is today. 20 years ago, he wouldn't have said that.
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:13.420]  And now he's done. It's like, well, I travel a couple times a year, I'll go through it.
[03:12:13.420 --> 03:12:14.420]  It's no big deal.
[03:12:14.420 --> 03:12:19.160]  They're not taking it personal. I mean, you've got to realize this is on purpose. Our government
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:25.020]  runs al-Qaeda publicly now. And do I get an apology from the neo-cons for attacking me
[03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:27.000]  because they were running them back then?
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  Right.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:32.640]  No, no, I'm worse because I'm right. And so they have Bloomberg and AP and others say
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:37.320]  I'm behind al-Qaeda now. They publicly are giving them weapons all over the world. And
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:41.840]  they're coming out saying I'm with al-Qaeda now, with no evidence, because they know,
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:43.760]  I know who they are.
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:48.560]  And it's all martial law training. That's all this is, folks. And they're gonna take
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:53.080]  everything. For people out there that think you're gonna get away with all this, you're
[03:12:53.080 --> 03:12:56.840]  gonna get away with going along with all this, you're not. Thank you for the call, Alex.
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:00.960]  Good to hear from you. Last caller that I have time for. Sorry, the phone system's closed
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:01.960]  now.
[03:13:01.960 --> 03:13:06.240]  We're gonna go to Tom in New York. You wanna talk about gay marriage? Go ahead.
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:09.000]  Oh, yeah. How you doing, Alex?
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  I'm all right. Go ahead.
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:16.440]  Okay. I have a few comments regarding the recent gay marriage decisions at the Supreme
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:22.220]  Court. I'd first like to say you can probably look up at your flag today and know that it
[03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:31.800]  represents queer sex. And I'd also like to say I'm one of the plaintiffs in one of the
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:37.920]  three gay marriage cases that were reviewed by the Supreme Court this week. And this is
[03:13:37.920 --> 03:13:45.760]  the case the mainstream press and the courts tried to suppress. And I was on a local show
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:53.680]  a few months ago, alerting the public to the blatant corruption that was surrounding these
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:59.880]  gay marriage cases at the Supreme Court. And we alleged, in our own action, that the case
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:06.080]  was rigged right from the moment it was filed, that the federal courts were being packed
[03:14:06.080 --> 03:14:14.840]  with gay clerks and personnel who were directing these cases to Clinton-Obama appointees.
[03:14:14.840 --> 03:14:22.200]  Well, I will say this. I don't get into people's sexual persuasions. To me, it's a big distraction.
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:28.920]  But the Democratic Party, and I appreciate your call, sir, and its operatives, undoubtedly
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:35.120]  do set up these little gay empires, basically. And that comes out all the time at the Justice
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:41.320]  Department with these women, and then they persecute the men. It's really bizarre. And
[03:14:41.320 --> 03:14:47.320]  then this obsession of sexualizing children in the public schools, I talked about this
[03:14:47.320 --> 03:14:51.700]  in the first hour today, where they wanna teach five-year-olds about all this.
[03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:57.280]  And there is an anti-family. I mean, turn on any TV show, and it's anti-family, anti-family.
[03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:02.480]  And that's about reducing population. That's about atomizing cultures, because they're
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:10.880]  branding it that, well, if you have a different identity or whatever, the government is like
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:14.920]  your mob boss that will give you protection. And then meanwhile, they're adding all these
[03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:19.480]  chemicals and things, the food and water, that conflict and confuse people as well.
[03:15:19.480 --> 03:15:22.680]  And this is all in Brave New World. We talked about this earlier in the show. What's your
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:23.680]  take on this?
[03:15:23.680 --> 03:15:28.600]  Did you, you have a little kid, well, I have four kids. I have three. Do you see Toy Story,
[03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:32.540]  the Toy Story trilogy? I haven't seen the last one. Do you know the father's name in
[03:15:32.540 --> 03:15:36.880]  Toy Story? I forget. There's no father. There is no father.
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:41.920]  Oh, that's right. They don't ever explain it. They don't ever talk about it. It's one
[03:15:41.920 --> 03:15:46.980]  of our family favorite movies. There's no father. I mean, it's not even that dad is
[03:15:46.980 --> 03:15:51.820]  a bust out sitting on the couch, lazy, won't play catch with the kid, that sort of thing.
[03:15:51.820 --> 03:15:55.560]  There is no father. They just went, you know what? We're not even gonna write it in there.
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:16:01.060]  And it's one of these things where I notice when you go and you speak to your kids, teachers
[03:16:01.060 --> 03:16:03.920]  at their school, or when you voice-
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:05.920]  They ignore the dad and look at the mom.
[03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:06.920]  Yes.
[03:16:06.920 --> 03:16:08.920]  This is a cult, man. This is a cult.
[03:16:08.920 --> 03:16:15.040]  It's strange. I find it disturbing. And usually I'm going in there not to talk about education.
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:18.620]  It's usually to talk about the things that are going on in the school, like why are you
[03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:22.960]  talking to the kids about pole dancing? Why are you showing a movie in class that is a
[03:16:22.960 --> 03:16:27.120]  basic, like a major motion picture movie that has nothing to do with learning?
[03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:28.760]  Why are we doing these things? Why aren't we talking-
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:34.080]  Well, they automatically trained everybody that men are stupid, every show. That's why
[03:16:34.080 --> 03:16:36.600]  I like Man of Steel. That was a pro-father movie.
[03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:37.600]  Yes.
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:38.600]  You saw it.
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:42.360]  Yes, I did. I saw it on Father's Day with my kids and my dad.
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:48.240]  But it's so rare. I mean, you go see Prometheus, the women are in charge. And again, when you
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:53.520]  study slavery, the Romans did that. And in slave populations, they put the women over
[03:16:53.520 --> 03:16:54.520]  the slaves.
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:16:57.120]  Well, I saw the trailer for that Elysium movie.
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:16:58.520]  Yes.
[03:16:58.520 --> 03:17:02.480]  Jodie Foster looks like she runs everything. She looks an awful lot like Hillary Clinton
[03:17:02.480 --> 03:17:03.480]  in that movie.
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:07.520]  Absolutely. No, no, but that's the, and again, it's not that, it's that they just replace
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:13.840]  one patriarchy with like a government patriarchy where the house slave is the woman enforcing
[03:17:13.840 --> 03:17:14.840]  it.
[03:17:14.840 --> 03:17:15.840]  Yeah, and I'm not saying-
[03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:16.840]  It's not even really a matriarch.
[03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:20.880]  They would walk around the house scratching their privates and burping and acting like
[03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:25.880]  Fred Flintstone. But you're supposed to run your family.
[03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:30.000]  Well, I'm gonna be honest. Women don't go for a real man who's nice to them, but who's
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:34.640]  in charge of a lot of things. They go, now for the criminal, that's what's seen as a
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:35.640]  man.
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:36.640]  Yeah.
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:39.640]  It's like you can't be a real good, decent, hardworking man. You're seen as a schmuck
[03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:46.640]  then. But if you're a criminal, then the women are, yeah, slapping them down. It's really,
[03:17:46.640 --> 03:17:53.120]  it's a sick society. It's everything is upside down. But I mean, I went and saw the probably
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:54.800]  one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
[03:17:54.800 --> 03:17:58.280]  I wanted to see it after Earth until the second half. The second half was actually pretty
[03:17:58.280 --> 03:18:03.360]  good, but it was really low budget. You could paper mache spaceships. So I actually recommend
[03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:08.880]  seeing it, it's just so bad. And they had ads for ABC shows. The first ad was The Dad's
[03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:11.640]  an Idiot. That's what the show's about. And I'm not really paying attention.
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:14.200]  You should just call it that. The show's called The Dad's an Idiot.
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:23.000]  Yeah, Dad's a moron. And then it cuts to The Fosters. And it's a lesbian cop with her lesbian
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:27.920]  wife, blonde and a black lady. And they've got like eight kids that have been taken from
[03:18:27.920 --> 03:18:34.120]  evil parents. And the bad guys on each show are the biological family. They go, the biologicals
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:35.120]  know where they are.
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:38.800]  Like it's a biological weapon. And then it shows the female cop like taking out the man,
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:43.920]  the dad. So now they've gone to the next level. And that's what it is. The state just sees
[03:18:43.920 --> 03:18:48.320]  that as the best way. Okay, we'll have all these people, plus they're gonna be sterilized
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:49.920]  anyways, can't reproduce.
[03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:54.360]  The heterosexual families, the homosexual families are really a state unit. And that's
[03:18:54.360 --> 03:18:58.080]  the ideal thing. It's a woman with a gun, everybody else is disarmed, and she's got
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:01.880]  eight kidnapped kids under her. And if the family tries to get them, they're terrorists.
[03:19:01.880 --> 03:19:06.200]  And of course, the family will be branded as bad people. I mean, this is over the top
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:08.640]  propaganda, over the top.
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:12.960]  Well, the minute that you get involved as a father, and I'm sure you've seen this. For
[03:19:12.960 --> 03:19:15.880]  instance, when the FEMA knocked on my door, and they saw me-
[03:19:15.880 --> 03:19:19.000]  Ship this network break, let's keep going.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:23.920]  When they expected a woman to answer or no one. And the minute a man came to the door,
[03:19:23.920 --> 03:19:24.920]  all of a sudden-
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:25.920]  It's like a terrorist may be there, yeah.
[03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:30.400]  Yeah, and it was like, well, what's going on? And even the guy was a little nervous.
[03:19:30.400 --> 03:19:32.800]  I videotaped it and I put it on YouTube.
[03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:36.520]  But notice the state's allowed to be hyper male though. The only thing that can be male
[03:19:36.520 --> 03:19:37.520]  is the state.
[03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:38.520]  Sure.
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:42.320]  It's got the guys with machine guns and armored vehicles. Sorry, go ahead.
[03:19:42.320 --> 03:19:46.280]  Well, this guy, and he wasn't very masculine, but I'll tell you, the guy that he went and
[03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:48.280]  reported to looked like-
[03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:49.280]  Military.
[03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:53.760]  One of those windbreakers, like an FBI sort of a jacket, except it said FEMA on the back,
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:54.760]  I believe.
[03:19:54.760 --> 03:19:55.760]  Yeah, it did.
[03:19:55.760 --> 03:19:59.400]  And he was the guy with the short hair, looked like he was ex-military. And the long haired
[03:19:59.400 --> 03:20:00.400]  guy went and reported-
[03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:01.880]  No, they sent the good cop trendy in.
[03:20:01.880 --> 03:20:06.780]  Yes, yeah. Well, and I'll tell you what, if my wife had answered, she wouldn't have felt
[03:20:06.780 --> 03:20:10.600]  very threatened by this guy that came to the door. He was real nebulous and-
[03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:13.920]  And it's all been psychological warfare-ed out. It's all actuary.
[03:20:13.920 --> 03:20:20.480]  What I can't figure out is why. Why were they there specifically? I know what the possibilities
[03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:24.540]  of what it, but it's like, well, there's other areas in the country where FEMA is needed
[03:20:24.540 --> 03:20:30.280]  right now. You all are coming to DuPage County is one of the richest, it's the coverage area
[03:20:30.280 --> 03:20:31.600]  of CKG.
[03:20:31.600 --> 03:20:35.280]  It's one of the richest counties in the United States. And there's not a lot of floodplains
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:40.740]  and problems. And people are struggling right now in Oklahoma, and they need FEMA. So what
[03:20:40.740 --> 03:20:41.740]  are you doing there?
[03:20:41.740 --> 03:20:46.020]  Well, they're on record saying they're sending on all these agencies just to get you acclimated
[03:20:46.020 --> 03:20:52.020]  to the contact. Just to get you ready to answer questions, yearly census now, not every decade.
[03:20:52.020 --> 03:20:54.920]  And he looked like he was really trying to check stuff out when he was there.
[03:20:54.920 --> 03:20:59.120]  He was waiting for an invitation. He was waiting for a, you wanna come in and just, come on
[03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:00.840]  in, I'll get you a bottle of water. And that's how people-
[03:21:00.840 --> 03:21:06.840]  Well, that's why cops now take blood at checkpoints and stand there and go, not if I take blood.
[03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:11.240]  And then it turns out it's for a federal program. And they admit they're just acclimating us
[03:21:11.240 --> 03:21:12.920]  for just taking the blood period.
[03:21:12.920 --> 03:21:16.040]  While people have a, I mean, with somebody in authority, a position of authority tells
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:23.920]  you to do something. Put my laptop on the tray? Okay, yes, yes, yes.
[03:21:23.920 --> 03:21:28.680]  I watched when I flew from England back to Dallas. I had to go through TSA again to get
[03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:36.480]  on my flight to Austin. And there was like four checkpoints. And there are these two,
[03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:43.200]  the classic South Park, the same goatees, the same kind of Nelly voice going, I told
[03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:45.280]  you, open passport, over there.
[03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:50.060]  And when they see me, they go, they knew who I was. They're like, that'll be a quick line
[03:21:50.060 --> 03:21:55.720]  for you, sir. And they still got the whole speech. They still got the whole nine yards.
[03:21:55.720 --> 03:22:00.160]  Five minutes long, they were freaking out. But the whole point was, everyone submitting,
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:03.920]  they were going, I told you, I mean, it was like-
[03:22:03.920 --> 03:22:07.560]  Do you go for the pat down? You make them give you the pat down?
[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:11.000]  Yeah, but then I sit there and tell them that this is all dog training, the government runs
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:14.920]  al-Qaeda. You know it's a fraud, and then they always do a fake pat down.
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:15.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:22:15.920 --> 03:22:22.600]  Well, not in Las Vegas. This guy was literally smacking his lips. He told me what I talked
[03:22:22.600 --> 03:22:27.200]  about the day before on my show. He was very excited. He got down his knees when he was
[03:22:27.200 --> 03:22:33.500]  doing it. And it was very, I was like, man, you're not my wife. It was pretty bad.
[03:22:33.500 --> 03:22:34.500]  This was in Vegas?
[03:22:34.500 --> 03:22:35.680]  Yeah, this was flying out of Vegas.
[03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:40.200]  I was in Vegas in May with my father. We're in the line to go through TSA. Four people
[03:22:40.200 --> 03:22:45.240]  ahead of us, literally, there's a 22-year-old barfing in a bag. He'd had a long night, he's
[03:22:45.240 --> 03:22:50.300]  going home. And I'm telling him, I'm like, we gotta go through and take our shoes off.
[03:22:50.300 --> 03:22:54.500]  They're gonna let a guy who's actually vomiting get onto the airplane. He's gonna go through
[03:22:54.500 --> 03:22:58.120]  TSA, no problem. He's gonna put his arms up, they're gonna scan him, they're gonna let
[03:22:58.120 --> 03:22:59.120]  him through.
[03:22:59.120 --> 03:23:02.560]  Meanwhile, maybe he's sick, maybe he's got something that could be spread to people.
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:06.560]  They're not gonna put him on the side. They're gonna make you two, us and everyone else,
[03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:10.600]  go through, take our shoes off, take our belts off, and all the whole thing. Put your arms
[03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:14.040]  up, get the radiation scan in the whole pit. And I stand and I go through the pat down
[03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:19.920]  every time. And we're going to Disney later on in the year, and I have four kids, two
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:21.440]  daughters.
[03:23:21.440 --> 03:23:25.400]  My son that was patted down last time, he had a broken leg at the time, so he was only
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:26.680]  temporarily in a wheelchair-
[03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:29.800]  Okay, so he's not special needs. I apologize for getting that wrong.
[03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:31.040]  No, no, that's okay, and I wanna clarify-
[03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:33.320]  That's right, there was another video of another kid that was.
[03:23:33.320 --> 03:23:34.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:34.320 --> 03:23:35.320]  I apologize.
[03:23:35.320 --> 03:23:36.320]  No, it's okay.
[03:23:36.320 --> 03:23:37.320]  Your son is not special needs.
[03:23:37.320 --> 03:23:43.960]  But we're gonna go through, and I'm anticipating the anxiety of having to look at my wife.
[03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:47.080]  And you hope, it's like gambling, you hope that you're gonna get the line where they
[03:23:47.080 --> 03:23:48.720]  just have a magnetometer.
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:49.720]  And then it's-
[03:23:49.720 --> 03:23:53.160]  By the way, they're supposed to, because it is the law that the groping of the kids is
[03:23:53.160 --> 03:23:57.780]  really illegal. They're supposed to direct everybody. I have some friends that are musicians
[03:23:57.780 --> 03:24:01.200]  that fly all the time, and they've got some little kids. They're supposed to direct them
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:02.200]  to a magnetometer.
[03:24:02.200 --> 03:24:06.280]  Yeah, well, we'll see if that happens, cuz I will videotape it, even though my wife's
[03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:09.880]  gonna be giving me the look. Like, what are you doing? Don't see it.
[03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:12.640]  But see, I mean, I'm sure your wife's a great lady, she's probably listening right now.
[03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:15.160]  You gotta be proud of the fact you're not rolling over.
[03:24:15.160 --> 03:24:20.920]  Yeah, but you know, baby steps, it's all baby steps.
[03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:26.560]  No, I get it, and women are, on average, more compliant with the state, on average. I'm
[03:24:26.560 --> 03:24:30.400]  not psychoanalyzing your wife. My wife's really smart, knows what's going on, but she's the
[03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:34.800]  same way. Like when I'm about to start preaching at people in a restaurant, if something happens,
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:36.440]  I'll get up and use it as an excuse.
[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:40.600]  Or in grocery store lines, she's like, can't you ever turn it off? But I'm like, hey, I
[03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:44.560]  know, but then if something rubs her wrong, I'll be telling her please turn it off. It's
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:48.080]  kind of like when your kids are being bad, whoever sees them being bad, yells at them
[03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:49.080]  or whatever.
[03:24:49.080 --> 03:24:52.760]  And then the other spouse goes, hey, don't be so mad at them. But I'm like, well, that's
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:56.920]  cuz you didn't see the build up to this. So I think that's more of what it is.
[03:24:56.920 --> 03:25:02.520]  Yeah, the idea of them going through what Rocco went through in that video a couple
[03:25:02.520 --> 03:25:03.520]  years back.
[03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:04.520]  That's a cool name.
[03:25:04.520 --> 03:25:08.600]  It took me like five years. My wife is from Iowa, so that name was like, might as well
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:15.200]  has been Guido to her. But to have him go through that again, or to have my daughters,
[03:25:15.200 --> 03:25:20.960]  my youngest daughter's only 15 months old. And the rub about this is, no pun intended,
[03:25:20.960 --> 03:25:24.660]  is when you go through that, you skip the magnetometer.
[03:25:24.660 --> 03:25:28.760]  So today on my way here, I didn't go through the magnetometer because I got the pad down.
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:32.160]  So I didn't go through a metal detector. They don't know what's on me. All they did was
[03:25:32.160 --> 03:25:38.560]  feel. It's actually less secure. So by saying that you wanna opt out, they're not checking
[03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:39.560]  to see if you have metal.
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:43.240]  But they admit that that's meant to pressure you into taking the scanner.
[03:25:43.240 --> 03:25:47.440]  Of course it is. And then they're checking you for explosives. That's the only thing
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:50.440]  that you could possibly do wrong.
[03:25:50.440 --> 03:25:54.080]  But I mean, these are the people that didn't wanna arm the pilots who were armed before
[03:25:54.080 --> 03:25:57.480]  but didn't choose to exercise it. We're gonna trust them with the aircraft.
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:25:58.480]  Yeah.
[03:25:58.480 --> 03:26:01.900]  That's 1,000 times more deadly, 10,000 times more deadly. I mean, I can't even do the math
[03:26:01.900 --> 03:26:07.700]  on that. But a flying missile, a giant missile with hundreds of people on it, but you can't
[03:26:07.700 --> 03:26:10.000]  trust them with a gun.
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:14.320]  It's true. I read, you saw the video of that man that broke into the woman's house and
[03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:19.880]  just it has been everywhere and he beat her and it's just almost impossible to watch.
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:21.560]  It's seeing those sorts of things and the sorts of-
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:23.040]  No, I'll be honest, I haven't seen that video.
[03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:24.040]  My God.
[03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:25.360]  We should play a clip and I should talk about it.
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:26.360]  It's horrible.
[03:26:26.360 --> 03:26:30.760]  That's the thing about this movie after Earth, these big fat alien things attack and no one's
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:34.880]  got a weapon to kill them. Cuz they're like liberals, you're only allowed to use a sword.
[03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:36.280]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:37.280]  Alex, this is-
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:38.280]  What's the name of the video?
[03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:43.020]  I don't know, but we'll find it afterward. It's a nanny cam. It was all over television
[03:26:43.020 --> 03:26:48.660]  yesterday and a man breaks into a woman's house and he, I mean, he beats her and hurts
[03:26:48.660 --> 03:26:53.120]  her in front of her child. And so then, obviously after that, there's a debate about, well,
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:54.480]  she would have had a gun, blah, blah, blah.
[03:26:54.480 --> 03:26:58.620]  And then the gun people are saying, well, it would have been locked up. And the thought
[03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:00.960]  of that is the sort of thing that, I'll tell you-
[03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:02.160]  Was he a mugger or something?
[03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:06.240]  Yeah, he was robbing, he was a home invader, robbing their home. And they haven't found
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:09.520]  him yet. So they're talking about how great it is that she-
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:14.400]  Well, you come in my house, you're dead. In fact, I'll show people on air right now. And
[03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:18.200]  people are so scared of firearms. I mean, you come in here trying to kill people, it's
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:19.200]  over.
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:20.200]  Well, you got a bunch of men here, right? You can carry-
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:21.920]  Yeah, we got a bunch of guys that are armed back there.
[03:27:21.920 --> 03:27:22.920]  I think it's great.
[03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:24.400]  But I mean, what's the big deal?
[03:27:24.400 --> 03:27:25.400]  Yeah.
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:27.120]  I mean, the criminal's gonna have a gun anyways.
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:29.120]  What is that, a 45?
[03:27:29.120 --> 03:27:30.120]  This is a.357.
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:31.120]  Nice.
[03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:34.680]  I mean, I only have this because even though I'm a good shot and good with more complex
[03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:40.800]  firearms and semi-autos, under stress. I mean, with this even short barrel, a medium barrel,
[03:27:40.800 --> 03:27:47.440]  I can shoot a man-sized target at 7,500 yards. Okay, so if somebody comes in here, I'm not
[03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:48.440]  missing.
[03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:49.440]  Yeah.
[03:27:49.440 --> 03:27:53.400]  And plus, this is pretty much a high velocity, almost a rifle round. So this is one of the
[03:27:53.400 --> 03:27:55.640]  most deadly rounds out there for a handgun. Much better-
[03:27:55.640 --> 03:28:00.200]  Do you know what would happen if you whip that out in Chicago in a mall? Or you had
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:04.620]  it in your studio. If you were in Mancow Studio and you took it out, people would crap their
[03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:05.620]  pants.
[03:28:05.620 --> 03:28:08.400]  But if they saw the government with it, they'd be feel safe.
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:14.680]  Right, right, there's nothing wrong with that. You're an American man, you have a Ford car,
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:17.800]  you've done all the things. By the way, you can't get ammo in Chicago.
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:20.080]  By the way, we have butcher knives in there.
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:22.880]  Right, right, or swimming pools, kids can drown in swimming pools.
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:23.880]  Or die from that.
[03:28:23.880 --> 03:28:27.280]  Knives, whatever. This man broke into her house and he pummeled her.
[03:28:27.280 --> 03:28:28.280]  What a tough guy.
[03:28:28.280 --> 03:28:32.280]  It was disgusting. I mean, it was just revolting. And my thought was, well, yeah, great, if
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:33.760]  she would have had a gun, except if it was not a gun-
[03:28:33.760 --> 03:28:35.720]  Is that it right there? Scroll down.
[03:28:35.720 --> 03:28:41.520]  Yes, God, it's terrible. It is disgusting to see this.
[03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:43.220]  And why is he doing this to her?
[03:28:43.220 --> 03:28:50.760]  He's robbing the home and worse off, her child is watching. And if you have a gun, great.
[03:28:50.760 --> 03:28:54.940]  But if you have it locked up and you don't have ammo close by, you still can't do anything.
[03:28:54.940 --> 03:28:55.940]  This man-
[03:28:55.940 --> 03:28:57.680]  Did we post this on Infowars.com?
[03:28:57.680 --> 03:29:03.140]  It's unbelievable. And he keeps coming back. This guy is a complete lunatic. And then he
[03:29:03.140 --> 03:29:09.920]  throws her down the stairs. Here's the miracle of miracles. She's alive. She's alive.
[03:29:09.920 --> 03:29:14.040]  This is good Stockholm syndrome. Look, she's groveling.
[03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:15.040]  It's unbelievable.
[03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:22.460]  And look, the kids are watching. Only in America will we put up with this. In England, he'd
[03:29:22.460 --> 03:29:27.920]  probably sue her if his fists were hurt and they would rule. I'm not joking. This is unbelievable.
[03:29:27.920 --> 03:29:28.920]  It's crazy.
[03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:34.440]  All right, Matt, thank you so much. 1530wckg.com. Everybody be sure and spread the word about
[03:29:34.440 --> 03:29:38.720]  us on in Chicago, buddy. Glad you came in and glad we found out about that video. We'll
[03:29:38.720 --> 03:29:44.680]  post it on Infowars.com right now. And I think she should have her fist cut off because those
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:49.520]  are weapons. I think we should disarm her, put her brain in a glass jar so we can just
[03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:51.200]  knock it off the table.
[03:29:51.200 --> 03:29:59.840]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
