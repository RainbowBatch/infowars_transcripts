[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.560]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.560 --> 00:36.560]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar
[00:36.560 --> 00:44.720]  I was sitting there this morning and this afternoon with a little notebook and I'd written about 10
[00:44.720 --> 00:54.800]  pages of of text of issues that I wanted to cover here today not so much from a futurist
[00:54.800 --> 01:06.880]  perspective that's kind of what the popular lexicon would label it as an attempt to simplify things
[01:06.880 --> 01:13.520]  the future is here it's been here for a long time there are technological government and
[01:13.520 --> 01:24.720]  corporate reservations that are highly advanced above the quasi dormant post-industrial civilization
[01:24.720 --> 01:35.040]  that we live in there is a completely engineered revolution against the natural world and natural
[01:35.040 --> 01:46.560]  processes being carried out by the scientific elite and the world they are building is not
[01:46.560 --> 01:52.800]  a pretty one for the average person and the world they're building is very very cold-blooded
[01:53.840 --> 02:01.200]  and anti-family anti-human and does not look to lift up humanity but instead to end humanity as
[02:01.200 --> 02:12.800]  we know it what's frustrating about this is not the lack of proof but the ocean size amounts of
[02:12.800 --> 02:26.240]  information with the different technocrats in public communiques telegraphing their unbelievable
[02:26.240 --> 02:35.920]  disgust and disdain for public they don't really publicize their disdain but they communicate it
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.200]  in establishment journals so it is public it's open source and it's really horrible
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.000]  and then they've got all of their propaganda minions they're fake futurists and the rest
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.080]  of them that go out and proselytize to the low level and mid-level manager class
[02:54.080 --> 03:00.000]  in academia in the medical system in the financial system in the culture system
[03:02.720 --> 03:13.680]  in fact for the incredible amounts of propaganda that we see being ladled out in the so-called
[03:13.680 --> 03:25.360]  news broadcast tv cable news channels newspapers radio political books that propaganda is at least
[03:25.360 --> 03:29.760]  a little more sophisticated because it's targeting someone who's quote politically aware
[03:31.760 --> 03:39.360]  or at one level higher in complexity and understanding and one degree closer to reality
[03:39.360 --> 03:45.840]  but for the unwashed masses that just think the men with suits are running things and
[03:45.840 --> 03:52.960]  choose a politician even if they vote off of how they look it's like trying to teach
[03:54.320 --> 03:56.000]  quantum mechanics to a
[03:56.000 --> 04:09.760]  bowl weevil and it's hard enough to get the general public to look around them and realize
[04:09.760 --> 04:18.960]  that they're in the middle of deep space on a planetoid with incredible opportunities and
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.440]  wonderment all around them it's hard to get them to look up from the dirt long enough to do that
[04:23.440 --> 04:29.040]  but when the system sets everything up to keep them looking down in the dirt that's a crime
[04:29.040 --> 04:35.120]  against humanity creates blowback cycles into the elite themselves and is super bad news
[04:36.320 --> 04:42.080]  so the world is being engineered into an authoritarian system not to even shield the
[04:42.080 --> 04:50.400]  elite in the future but to just totally have a revolution against our modern world itself and
[04:50.400 --> 04:56.480]  our modern world itself and humanity the news is coming up and i'm going to break down the
[04:56.480 --> 05:02.320]  future of humanity straight ahead did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the
[05:02.320 --> 05:08.400]  21st century record foreclosure rates for homes if not yours your neighbors thankful for the
[05:08.400 --> 05:13.840]  unemployment check since you were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in
[05:13.840 --> 05:19.120]  hopes of a christmas gift along with thousands of other americans did you ever think your future
[05:19.120 --> 05:25.360]  would feel this out of control the fact is in all this craziness there's only one thing you can
[05:25.360 --> 05:32.400]  control your greatest dependency your food supply make 2012 the year you take control by getting

[05:54.560 --> 06:06.240]  slash alex remember you can bet your life on efoods direct you are listening to an infowars.com
[06:06.240 --> 06:21.440]  frontline report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:21.440 --> 06:30.000]  from deep in the heart of fema region 6 austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[06:30.000 --> 06:44.000]  for more than 16 years on radio i have pointed out that i come to you live from deep behind enemy
[06:44.000 --> 06:52.320]  lines fema region 6 and i remember a long time ago different radio consultants that contacted me
[06:52.320 --> 07:01.680]  over the years and vice presidents and presidents at major radio networks who contacted me it was
[07:01.680 --> 07:07.200]  always the same line okay alex there is globalism there is a move to get rid of national sovereignty
[07:07.200 --> 07:13.680]  but that's a natural progression and you need to decide whether you're going to be on a crusade
[07:14.560 --> 07:17.120]  that goes nowhere or whether you want to be a star
[07:17.120 --> 07:30.720]  and even 14 15 16 years ago when i had almost no money it was not tempting over the years to be
[07:30.720 --> 07:37.360]  offered millions and millions of dollars to go join the establishment and be in the company of
[07:37.360 --> 07:44.480]  people that don't care about you and who have sold themselves to the highest bidder over and
[07:44.480 --> 07:56.960]  over again i do not wish to sit at table or to associate with judas iscariot fellow travelers
[07:56.960 --> 08:05.840]  of that spirit and let's get one thing straight it's not because i'm some goody two-shoes it's
[08:05.840 --> 08:13.120]  not because i'm high and mighty it's because i've seen reality i've discovered reality
[08:13.120 --> 08:15.600]  i've discovered the real world
[08:17.920 --> 08:24.160]  and no amount of money is worth it to lie to the public and to try to deceive people
[08:24.800 --> 08:28.720]  with simplistic colloquialisms and pap
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.480]  because doing that is basically cutting off my own nose to spite my face it's
[08:36.480 --> 08:39.200]  gouging out my eyes and that of my children
[08:39.200 --> 08:45.520]  i cannot and i will not join with evil
[08:48.880 --> 08:59.680]  but over the years i've had so many people contact me station owners sponsors radio executives and
[08:59.680 --> 09:06.640]  they say stuff like fema region six i mean the general public doesn't even know what that is
[09:06.640 --> 09:12.240]  well why do you have a liner saying that because i want people to think about what fema region six
[09:12.240 --> 09:20.720]  means i want people to tune in at first and think oh it's hokey he's talking about broadcasting
[09:20.720 --> 09:32.880]  from deep behind enemy lines because you see i am broadcasting from behind enemy lines the
[09:32.880 --> 09:41.200]  establishment sees the united states is done as captured as run by the big megabanks the big
[09:41.200 --> 09:47.120]  ponzi scheme operators that have created the thousands i said thousands of trillions of
[09:48.000 --> 09:59.120]  dollars in fake financial instruments and bought our politicians for less than one
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.040]  one millionth of it in fact i've had a lot of political analysts on who've pointed out that
[10:05.040 --> 10:11.440]  the average politician in congress can be bought for a couple hundred thousand dollars on a major
[10:11.440 --> 10:17.920]  issue and these companies
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.840]  can go spend a couple hundred thousand dollars per politician per key politician can go spend
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.280]  a couple hundred thousand dollars per politician per key politician campaign chairman and others
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.400]  and then have government shut down their competition or give them a government contract
[10:36.400 --> 10:44.960]  worth tens of billions of dollars and so they literally buy them for pennies
[10:47.200 --> 10:54.880]  the special interest in and you see i've made it my life's work to discover who are those
[10:54.880 --> 11:01.680]  who are the best and what have they set up and what is their end game and what makes them kick
[11:01.680 --> 11:08.720]  and i went and read the publications and the books and the white papers and the academic
[11:09.520 --> 11:17.760]  communiques between these different groups and overall they are eugenicist
[11:17.760 --> 11:25.280]  adherents that is they follow the science of eugenics i know for new listeners just
[11:26.080 --> 11:31.520]  when you think eugenics think hitler but but hitler didn't invent eugenics he was one
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.360]  manifestation of eugenics and our entire world in their own words
[11:40.880 --> 11:42.320]  is a laboratory
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.360]  i was at my parents a couple hours ago i took my children over there to visit with them and drop
[11:47.360 --> 11:55.200]  them off and we were debating when i go out to florida next month to give some speeches at some
[11:55.200 --> 12:02.000]  radio stations and things whether i would take them to disney world and i know it's a commercial
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.280]  thing and and and and exploitive and all that i understand that the point is you know do you go
[12:07.280 --> 12:12.400]  experience that as my parents took me to experience it and we're having a debate about
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.560]  the biometrics my dad's saying you know it's just about having you opt in to finger scan and all
[12:16.560 --> 12:22.320]  that they're already face scanning you and i said of course but i said the point is is that i just
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.480]  don't want to be around it but obviously it's being expanded out from there and i said the
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.200]  whole thing is obviously a department of defense laboratory because everything else is through
[12:31.200 --> 12:39.600]  darpa and i had my iphone which itself is a darpa projected creation and i said here let's type in
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.840]  department of defense laboratory disney biometrics because i'd already seen some of that back in the
[12:45.840 --> 12:55.360]  mid-90s and i typed in biometrics disney and i found the electronic frontier foundation other
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.680]  groups but also found disney press releases and i found the electronic frontier foundation
[12:59.680 --> 13:06.320]  found disney press releases how and again i already knew this even though i had only
[13:06.320 --> 13:11.200]  small pieces of it over a decade the last time i looked at it i already knew it was a department
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.040]  of defense laboratory sure enough they're all department of defense laboratories their cruise
[13:17.040 --> 13:23.760]  ships are and it says it's a department of defense deal they have this new disney usa
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.600]  where when you go stay at the uh not just disney world but this other facility when you go stay at
[13:29.600 --> 13:39.760]  disney usa it's a interactive laboratory and when you go on the cruise ship it face scans you
[13:39.760 --> 13:46.240]  but you get to feel uppity and big that it talks to you like something out of minority report
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.040]  and of course they already had technology that face scans you and active billboards
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.320]  before that movie even came out they had that stuff developed
[13:54.320 --> 14:00.160]  when philip k dick was out in san francisco writing minority report in the 1970s
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.720]  the truth is pkd and people like that were actually hanging around with the silicon valley
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.320]  people everything we've been allowed to see is at least 30 years old that's what i'm trying to get
[14:16.320 --> 14:21.280]  across to you and my dad's like really it's department of defense and i went and typed
[14:21.280 --> 14:30.720]  that in disney department of defense laboratory boom whole thing human tracking testing system
[14:30.720 --> 14:38.080]  but so are the grocery stores the big ones so are the malls all of it i mean i've been given the
[14:38.080 --> 14:43.360]  tours of the university of texas psychology department over 90 of its darpa funded
[14:43.360 --> 14:50.960]  and in there again the first time i got a shirt of it like 15 years ago
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.560]  see it turns out disney is testing the prison city model for the department of defense since
[14:58.560 --> 15:03.760]  their first official contract in 1996 and the guys have pulled up some documents for people
[15:03.760 --> 15:09.360]  watching on prison planet.tv but you can actually just type in 1996 it'll pull it up because see
[15:09.360 --> 15:16.000]  disney is a city and so the model of tracking people going into disney world since 96 was the
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.520]  model they used in fallujah thumb scanning face scanning and entering it it's a model at the
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.840]  airport but just to get you ready for prisoner training then they put their hands on you as well
[15:28.560 --> 15:35.760]  it's all dog training and again i've covered one one millionth of the data i've got okay literally
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.200]  i mean you understand that right so so so the only way we're going to beat this technocracy
[15:41.760 --> 15:45.680]  is realizing it's there and if you're a new listener like yeah right the department of
[15:45.680 --> 15:51.200]  defense disney go look it up they're not hiding it they're very proud of it and it's the model
[15:51.200 --> 15:57.280]  for everything being a giant prison to make sure you drink your sodium water sodium fluoride water
[15:57.280 --> 16:06.720]  and you know the rest when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but

[20:25.040 --> 20:31.200]  yeah i'm not going to spend all day on disney world but i did notice that obama's going to
[20:31.200 --> 20:36.400]  disney world next week and they're going to shut most of it down for his lordship and his
[20:36.400 --> 20:43.120]  wife and children but that's all part of this other fraud this facade this fantasy land
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.720]  that we see here on the cover of this week's time magazine obama's world an exclusive interview
[20:49.440 --> 20:55.600]  by mr builderberg group attendee for read zarkaria and it's all about how obama actually
[20:55.600 --> 21:01.680]  runs things you see the true social engineers the true owners of our world want you to really
[21:01.680 --> 21:09.200]  believe the buck stops with a teleprompter reading lawyer who runs absolutely nothing
[21:09.200 --> 21:14.080]  and is a mouthpiece of the political interest and financial interest that put him in power
[21:14.080 --> 21:19.440]  and financed him with over a billion dollars in the 2008 campaign you notice who he just appointed
[21:19.440 --> 21:25.600]  as the as the finance head in the white house getting rid of the old uh from the famous mob
[21:25.600 --> 21:36.320]  family uh daily they hired the the last head of bain capital who replaced mit romney the guy who
[21:36.320 --> 21:42.160]  supports abortion carbon taxes open borders gun control and road obamacare that republicans are
[21:42.160 --> 21:48.800]  being told uh by the paid for mouthpieces is the guy they've got to elect or they can choose
[21:48.800 --> 21:56.800]  newt ginrich who politico's reporting called for censorship of the internet in 2006 supports carbon
[21:56.800 --> 22:01.520]  taxes world government an end of the family don't believe me just type newt ginrich supports an end
[22:01.520 --> 22:06.080]  of the family end of sovereignty he'll pull up his quotes i mean i've actually read the forward to
[22:06.960 --> 22:13.040]  the toffler's book where he said it all better find out better find out what's really going on
[22:13.040 --> 22:22.960]  here but my point is that that that the social engineers first and foremost want you dependent
[22:22.960 --> 22:30.240]  on the system they don't like farmers they don't like ranchers they don't like people that know
[22:30.240 --> 22:35.520]  how to skin a buck and run a trot line because the country boy can't survive they want you in
[22:35.520 --> 22:44.160]  big compact cities working for a handful of mega corporations who are authoritarian and anti-human
[22:44.160 --> 22:51.680]  and the the fortune 100 themselves are financed owned and run by the six big mega banks globally
[22:51.680 --> 23:00.800]  who on record again have the licensure through fraud to create unlimited currency and credit
[23:00.800 --> 23:06.160]  whenever they want so imagine you've got ultra rich fraudsters who don't go to jail like bernie
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.600]  madoff or die after sentencing like ken lay who by the way created carbon taxes with al gore
[23:11.600 --> 23:16.880]  in 1995 look it up now those are low level guys that end up getting burned you know the system
[23:16.880 --> 23:23.120]  sacrifices a few uh in this whole uh you know system occasionally to make the public think
[23:23.120 --> 23:28.240]  the bad guys are being punished but it's always a mid-level nobody like bernie madoff bernie madoff
[23:28.240 --> 23:35.360]  deals 50 60 billion dollars the globalist steal trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions
[23:35.360 --> 23:44.640]  and then have the the the bought and paid for dinosaur uh sewer rat sewer line mainstream
[23:44.640 --> 23:50.880]  media tell you that the very mega banks that engineered the fraud that we've bailed out
[23:50.880 --> 23:55.200]  that are too big to fail they're now the people in europe the us and everywhere else
[23:55.200 --> 24:02.720]  that that that tell us what to do and that tell us what our future is going to be and have armies
[24:02.720 --> 24:08.800]  of little fake futurists out there running around telling us everything's random and the world's all
[24:08.800 --> 24:21.040]  up for grabs and the truth is everything at the base level is engineered within confines within
[24:21.040 --> 24:29.520]  within a grid and there is randomness within that but that is all basically predictably scanned
[24:29.520 --> 24:35.840]  through google and other systems i don't mean you searching google that's what you think the
[24:35.840 --> 24:43.600]  function is when you go to google it's getting all the data on you what you're into what you read
[24:43.600 --> 24:50.320]  where you go how much money you've got your sexual habits what you what you eat what you're
[24:50.320 --> 24:58.400]  what you're thinking when you order a pizza from a large pizza chain it's been on record for eight
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.280]  years that they run your background and sell that data to the government and then if there's
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.360]  any warrants out for you they put it in a file for the government to know don't believe me just
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.920]  look up usa today on that scofflaws get caught ordering pizzas the point is you're given an
[25:13.920 --> 25:20.080]  iphone you go pay for it you're made to line up for it they don't manufacture enough or or create
[25:20.080 --> 25:26.800]  the christmas toy phenomenon of stampedes for the slave-produced product you get it
[25:28.080 --> 25:32.320]  you think that it's trendy a a a totem or logo of power
[25:34.480 --> 25:41.040]  it's so fun it's the latest thing yeah there's the usa today article missouri tracks scofflaws
[25:41.040 --> 25:46.640]  via pizza delivery database you didn't get the right to remain silent when you order that pizza
[25:46.640 --> 25:53.520]  did you i mean i would tell the childlike public 15 16 years ago that all cell phones are tracked
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.560]  in real time illegally by the government but back then the public was told the nsa didn't exist i
[25:58.560 --> 26:06.800]  actually had national news 14 15 years ago repeatedly say i was insane that the nsa didn't
[26:06.800 --> 26:12.480]  exist oh now you all know it exists because now they're ready to tell you they always tell you
[26:12.480 --> 26:19.680]  decades after it's in place and echelon and the rest of it and uh yuppies and people that don't
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.400]  have a respect for themselves they think that if they just deny something's happening that gives
[26:24.400 --> 26:30.880]  them power over it and so one day none of this exists but as soon as the establishment announces
[26:30.880 --> 26:36.560]  it exists oh it exists but that's okay because they're given a reason for it existing kind of
[26:36.560 --> 26:42.800]  like the cancer viruses they put in your vaccines and i get emails and letters people on the street
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.200]  go well there are too many people oh really well do you like you like dying of cancer young you
[26:47.200 --> 26:56.080]  like your kid dying of it oh no no oh see you were imagining you were part of the elite but see you
[26:56.080 --> 27:04.080]  aren't see it's very very sick and that's why it's very very sick when i hear grown men and adults
[27:04.080 --> 27:11.520]  getting all uh exercised and excited about the football game about the basketball game or
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.320]  about golf and it may be so oh my gosh did you see this and they have all the little factoids
[27:16.320 --> 27:22.320]  everything and i'm like why don't you get some factoids about global governance or about the
[27:22.320 --> 27:29.360]  post-industrial world that the the technocrats are setting up or or about binary weapon systems
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.040]  in your food water and vaccines why don't you find out what a binary weapon system is why don't you
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.240]  just type in rockefeller foundation sterilants and vaccines i mean you'll be on their foundation
[27:40.240 --> 27:46.720]  website they've got it all public they think you're so stupid it's all public why your 30
[27:46.720 --> 27:55.120]  year old wife can't have a kid or why you got prostate cancer at 40 or or or why you've got all
[27:55.120 --> 28:01.680]  those uh spinal problems from the sodium fluoride or why your seven-year-old son just got diagnosed
[28:01.680 --> 28:09.680]  with bone cancer or why all the birth defects are so high you know you have that kid who's got all
[28:09.680 --> 28:18.640]  those organs malformed you think you might want to know who did it you might want to know why all
[28:18.640 --> 28:27.920]  this is happening but no you don't because there's this pretty shiny sparkly fake glitter las vegas
[28:27.920 --> 28:36.160]  new world order system the fake cities of las vegas and disney and and the cruise ships and
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.440]  the biometrics and all of these little contained artificial environments why does the department
[28:41.440 --> 28:47.680]  of defense study those because they're going to turn the whole world into a time square where
[28:47.680 --> 28:52.960]  you're bombarded by the brainwashing where you're bombarded by the propaganda where you are a
[28:52.960 --> 29:01.280]  prisoner brainwashed not me i've seen reality i've seen what the controllers see this is alex jones
[29:01.280 --> 29:06.240]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[29:06.240 --> 29:11.200]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[29:11.200 --> 29:16.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.240]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[29:26.240 --> 29:31.680]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[29:31.680 --> 29:36.960]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.840]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[29:41.840 --> 29:46.560]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get
[29:46.560 --> 29:53.440]  more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't
[29:53.440 --> 30:03.600]  own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 hi folks this is alex jones and i
[30:03.600 --> 30:08.560]  want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[30:08.560 --> 30:13.760]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[30:13.760 --> 30:19.360]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[30:19.360 --> 30:24.880]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver
[30:24.880 --> 30:30.880]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[30:30.880 --> 30:36.720]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure
[30:36.720 --> 30:42.400]  and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step
[30:42.400 --> 30:49.760]  instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today
[30:49.760 --> 30:53.280]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator
[30:53.280 --> 30:56.160]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[31:01.280 --> 31:05.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[31:05.280 --> 31:10.960]  this is our last chance to not relive history as they're finishing off this agenda they'll
[31:10.960 --> 31:16.640]  be pulling the rug from underneath americans at home tremendous influence on our president
[31:16.640 --> 31:22.480]  and congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[31:22.480 --> 31:28.160]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[31:28.160 --> 31:33.520]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[31:33.520 --> 31:37.840]  constructing world government tim geithner bernanke they're arsonists they're asking
[31:37.840 --> 31:42.080]  for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[31:42.080 --> 31:49.200]  like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your

[31:56.880 --> 32:03.360]  at prisonplanet.tv hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[32:03.360 --> 32:08.000]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.560]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[32:12.560 --> 32:16.400]  have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[32:16.400 --> 32:21.120]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[32:21.120 --> 32:27.280]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of
[32:27.280 --> 32:31.840]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[32:31.840 --> 32:36.960]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[32:36.960 --> 32:43.760]  garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call
[32:43.760 --> 32:55.680]  at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[32:55.680 --> 33:04.000]  barter item this is alex jones for survivalseedbank.com coast to coast direct from austin
[33:04.000 --> 33:28.160]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network all right we are live
[33:28.160 --> 33:38.720]  we are live it is the 22nd day of january 2012 i'll have open phones and a ton of other
[33:38.720 --> 33:46.960]  really important news in the second hour today i'm here every sunday 4 to 6 pm blasting out on
[33:46.960 --> 33:54.480]  the sunday show on more than 60 am and fm stations the weekday show over 100 xm channel 166
[33:54.480 --> 34:02.640]  the websites are infowars.com prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv amongst many others like
[34:02.640 --> 34:08.240]  what is the endgame.com oh you don't know what the endgame is that's like saying i don't know what the
[34:08.800 --> 34:16.720]  matrix is one cannot be told about the matrix one has to see the matrix for themselves
[34:16.720 --> 34:26.400]  and i am tending to wax philosophical here because my mind swims around the great reservoir
[34:26.400 --> 34:33.840]  of research i've done and then in the spoken word to assemble the information
[34:33.840 --> 34:48.640]  the information is a great task to try to assemble it simply but if you assemble it simply
[34:48.640 --> 34:54.000]  then that falls in the paradigm of not being three-dimensional and having depth to it because
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.480]  when you're communicating with a population that's been trained in one-dimensional thought processes
[34:58.480 --> 35:03.600]  it's very very hard
[35:08.640 --> 35:10.400]  the best way to put this is
[35:12.720 --> 35:20.400]  the general public is basically in different degrees of sleep and i mean technically is in
[35:20.400 --> 35:28.320]  sleep now you can pull up bbc articles major studies about television being directly linked to
[35:28.320 --> 35:33.040]  different neurological disorders not just seizures but early onset of
[35:36.320 --> 35:41.680]  things like alzheimer's in fact just type in alzheimer's tv first one's bbc but there's about
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.960]  three million articles on it or hits last time i checked a few months ago we'll see what it is now
[35:46.960 --> 35:53.920]  again i want listeners understand every sentence i say can be pulled up as a data point
[35:54.480 --> 35:57.440]  that's how my brain works none of this is my opinion
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.760]  and i know the future you know why i know the future because the future already happened the
[36:05.760 --> 36:16.880]  future is already here we are in a subterranean suppressed sloth-like slow motion future
[36:16.880 --> 36:23.920]  that is dripped out like poison honey from a honey hive and the globalists repping their technocratic
[36:25.120 --> 36:31.840]  beehive and we're down here like addled poisoned ants stumbling around
[36:31.840 --> 36:44.800]  and one cannot be told about the matrix one must see it i think a simple way to put this is
[36:50.400 --> 36:57.040]  we are not in a matrix but the technocrats the globalists are trying to build one
[36:57.040 --> 37:06.320]  they're trying to build a completely artificial habitat for the general public
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.520]  they're trying to limit the information you come in contact with they're trying to make you very
[37:15.520 --> 37:23.920]  very shallow they're trying to reduce the language and the number of words people use the system
[37:23.920 --> 37:28.800]  the system admits in so many white papers that'll make your head spin that they want to
[37:28.800 --> 37:33.520]  basically abolish the family and they've done an incredible job of that
[37:36.800 --> 37:41.280]  and then you read all these globalist white papers like the wired magazine article i've
[37:41.280 --> 37:47.280]  talked about for 14 years why the future doesn't need us bill joy co-owner sun micro systems
[37:47.280 --> 37:54.320]  and he says in the article you know i went to this conference with 200 tech company owners
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.040]  some of the richest guys in the world and you know the debate was do we kill everybody
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.280]  because they're not needed anymore because labor isn't just cheap it's actually a negative because
[38:07.280 --> 38:12.080]  of robotics and the future and claiming that humans are hurting the earth or do we give people
[38:12.080 --> 38:19.520]  little mindless games and fake jobs and a fake civilization to live in and he says that's the
[38:19.520 --> 38:27.600]  debate we're having right now and i've read similar white papers and similar articles
[38:27.600 --> 38:33.040]  hundreds of times from the establishment and then i try to have a discussion with my listeners at
[38:33.040 --> 38:39.840]  an adult level from the perspective of what the people running this planet are really discussing
[38:39.840 --> 38:46.240]  discussing in fact we can we can just type in alzheimer's television and it'll bring up the
[38:46.240 --> 38:50.800]  bbc just alzheimer's television and then we can also type in why the future doesn't need us we'll
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.440]  show people both those i think people are listening on the radio they go you'll show us both
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.160]  yes at prison planet.tv we're streaming video and there's a little free video function at
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.280]  info wars.com you want to watch it there but you can do this this is interactive radio this is
[39:05.280 --> 39:14.160]  meant really that this show is designed around radio the the video side of it is just a small
[39:14.160 --> 39:23.280]  outgrowth yeah that's not the article man jailed for sharing his father's industrial
[39:24.080 --> 39:30.880]  composition just did you just type alzheimer's television just alzheimer's tv and boom it's
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.360]  right there at least at least it was like a month ago or have you typed in why the future doesn't
[39:35.360 --> 39:40.560]  need us it's wired magazine april issue 1999 you can pull it up right there
[39:44.480 --> 39:49.680]  did you click web or did you click news yeah you don't click web because it's old
[39:49.680 --> 39:59.680]  new stuffs you click news old stuff you click web there it is bbc top link
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.200]  new stuff you click news is the other way around
[40:07.280 --> 40:15.600]  new stuff you click news old stuff you click web when you're using this nsa search engine google
[40:15.600 --> 40:22.960]  so there it is tv's link to alzheimer's okay uh here is the next one why the future doesn't need
[40:22.960 --> 40:24.240]  us bill joy
[40:29.680 --> 40:35.120]  it's why the future doesn't need us i believe it's april 1999 we'll see if i'm accurate in my memory
[40:35.920 --> 40:44.400]  so yeah there it is why the future doesn't need us bill joy april 2000 oh see my
[40:44.400 --> 40:50.720]  little primitive electrochemical computer failed you get little glitches like that
[40:53.520 --> 40:55.120]  a group glitch here
[40:57.040 --> 41:03.040]  hey nobody's bad i'm i'm glad that you guys were going to the i mean how do you know that
[41:04.080 --> 41:07.200]  because radio listeners are listening they're doing the same thing right now
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.480]  and that's important that's like last week you know we we had an article that was linked on
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.680]  drudge at this top story for like a day that uh was dealing with
[41:20.560 --> 41:27.920]  the whole situation with the internet wars that have begun the future of the web the future of
[41:27.920 --> 41:33.600]  technological development uh you know being basically fought out right now and from this
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.600]  point on it's just going to intensify there's always been internet wars but i mean they're
[41:37.600 --> 41:43.920]  really really really kicking now that's the daily bell article that came out a day after ours
[41:44.880 --> 41:53.840]  our article is um the great internet wars have begun but um that's a good article too
[41:57.920 --> 42:05.840]  i mean i don't know it's like i'm supposed to apologize because i'm informed it's like i'm
[42:05.840 --> 42:12.320]  bad because i'm smart i'm bad because i actually study what the global controllers are into
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.520]  and they're into building a giant global prison and then killing us and they say they're going
[42:17.520 --> 42:24.800]  to do it and i'm giving you all the proof of it and uh i'm still the bad guy i mean i would be
[42:24.800 --> 42:31.760]  a great guy if i got up here and i talk about the nfl playoffs people like man he's really manly he
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.440]  he watches something piped into his house and comments on it and and lives through other people
[42:41.280 --> 42:46.320]  but uh we're gonna come back from break and i'm gonna get into the big threats to humanity
[42:46.320 --> 42:51.280]  i'm gonna list just a few of them for you then we'll start the uh second hour
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.120]  and then i will take your phone calls and cover the other news
[42:57.120 --> 43:02.160]  did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century record foreclosure

[46:19.120 --> 46:24.240]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded

[46:56.000 --> 47:07.680]  1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting
[47:07.680 --> 47:11.920]  network network
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[47:23.040 --> 47:30.560]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network and what is the new world order
[47:31.680 --> 47:36.160]  well it's the ponzi scheme operators that were able to take over the u.s in 1913
[47:38.000 --> 47:44.640]  and many other countries before and after that date and they issue the currency and credit they
[47:44.640 --> 47:50.800]  are god on this planet through fraud through scams through buying off politicians
[47:50.800 --> 47:57.840]  and we've lived under that hoax for so long that did you know that when you hear about your city
[47:57.840 --> 48:05.200]  or county or school district or state's budget that that's a total fraud in the 1930s and 40s
[48:05.200 --> 48:13.680]  the chicago mafia had a 1313 system is what it was called and they would have a double set of books
[48:13.680 --> 48:20.560]  they would have a double set of books and they would through the city of chicago tell the public
[48:20.560 --> 48:27.280]  about the budget but generally about 70 or more of the money was in other accounts they just didn't
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.160]  call it budget and they would have big budgetary discussions about our budgets this our budgets
[48:32.160 --> 48:38.000]  that but in the comprehensive annual financial reports they had all the real investments in the
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.280]  rest of the money and it's the same thing here that's what i'm saying folks it's all completely
[48:43.280 --> 48:50.560]  fake i mean i'm sure you've heard the city of austin's announcing between 30 and 80 rate height
[48:50.560 --> 48:56.080]  increases overall energy globally has gotten cheaper but they don't care they're saying it's
[48:56.080 --> 49:01.440]  for the earth we're going to charge you more no it's for the big power companies that came in and
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.600]  used federal regulators to shut down their competition this is happening all over the
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.960]  country but here in austin it's more egregious because our city council is so mindless and
[49:10.960 --> 49:17.760]  corrupt it's a mixture of both and they're just going to slap these giant rate increases on people
[49:19.040 --> 49:21.840]  people are like well that's the government trying to get a shortfall
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.240]  a small part of it is a budgetary shortfall but you're not looking at all the other accounts
[49:28.240 --> 49:34.240]  that are off the budgetary discussion that no one ever talks about i mean folks if you're a
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.520]  new listener this is big medicine i'm giving you this is the man behind the curtain this is the
[49:39.520 --> 49:45.200]  this is the lottery numbers this is the this is the big kahuna and i hope it's not pearls before
[49:45.200 --> 49:55.120]  swine and it just goes on from there i remember in 2000 the federal government only had a few dozen
[49:55.120 --> 50:01.520]  predator drones when they were saying by 2012 more than half of the air force's
[50:01.520 --> 50:13.040]  force would be drone and i saw a number just two days ago they've now got seven thousand predators
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.400]  alone and they've got all these reapers and all the rest of it and then there's that whole
[50:18.400 --> 50:24.480]  discussion thereof humans aren't even going to be involved in the military soon except for servicing
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.240]  the equipment and so that makes you more detached from war crimes and now they've announced with
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.600]  the nda they'll secretly arrest citizens and bomb any country they want without even talking to
[50:35.600 --> 50:43.600]  congress and the police are using predators and reapers on citizens now for stolen cows or
[50:43.600 --> 50:46.000]  pot grows or whatever the case is
[50:48.480 --> 50:52.320]  america it doesn't even exist anymore the united states was
[50:53.040 --> 50:57.760]  beach headed in 1913 with the federal reserve and has been taken over by the military industrial
[50:57.760 --> 51:03.360]  complex it's self-controlled by the technocratic elite that's the rest of eisenhower's 1960 speech
[51:03.920 --> 51:14.560]  1961 speech it's just totally fake it's totally fake and how do you talk to a public
[51:14.560 --> 51:19.840]  that doesn't know even the three branches of government much less that that's been usurped
[51:19.840 --> 51:26.160]  and that the entire military is going to combat drones in the air combat robots on the ground
[51:27.040 --> 51:30.640]  that the globalists have all these white papers saying soon they'll be able to do whatever they
[51:30.640 --> 51:36.080]  want because they're going to have big enough robot armies to not rely on u.s troops not
[51:36.080 --> 51:45.200]  pulling triggers on citizens there's a giant national security state being built behind a
[51:45.200 --> 51:54.480]  tissue-thin curtain and now they've they've pulled that down and it's staring us right in the face
[51:59.200 --> 52:02.960]  i mean how many years did i tell you that they were going to be using
[52:02.960 --> 52:08.640]  military and police on the streets of america how many years did i tell you before 9 11 there'd be
[52:08.640 --> 52:13.680]  giant terror attacks and i said they'd probably blow up the world trade center by the way that's
[52:13.680 --> 52:19.680]  on record uh even rolling stone new york magazine nightline they've all reported on that that is a
[52:19.680 --> 52:23.760]  fact they didn't believe it they went and checked i said they'll blow up the world trade center blame
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.480]  on their asset bin laden as a pretext to invade this list of countries which were accurate
[52:28.480 --> 52:32.960]  and as a pretext to set up domestic security checkpoints that'll begin in the airports
[52:35.520 --> 52:39.600]  i even said they'd launch a bio attack shortly after the attack on the world trade center
[52:39.600 --> 52:44.880]  and thanks to the adl it's not just me saying that it's on record the adl on september 12th
[52:44.880 --> 52:50.720]  in an article titled what they're saying attacked me and said jones says a bio attack
[52:50.720 --> 52:55.680]  has already been launched why didn't the fbi come and question me
[52:58.320 --> 53:01.040]  i mean how did i know the world trade center was going to be blown up
[53:02.080 --> 53:04.640]  how did i know a bio attack had already been launched
[53:04.640 --> 53:08.480]  you ever think about that
[53:08.480 --> 53:13.920]  you realize what i've done in front of all of you do you realize that i've completely
[53:13.920 --> 53:18.960]  reverse engineered their entire system to the point that i'm at my parents house today
[53:18.960 --> 53:27.040]  and i say disney world is a department of defense laboratory never even seeing that information
[53:27.680 --> 53:32.400]  i knew they were involved in developing biometrics and we're going to have to do that
[53:32.400 --> 53:37.280]  we're going to be developing biometrics and we pulled it up with department of defense white
[53:37.280 --> 53:43.120]  papers and we've put them on screen here today how did i know that because the whole thing's
[53:43.120 --> 53:49.600]  a laboratory president eisenhower warns you i'm not psychic the whole thing's fake
[53:52.560 --> 53:54.000]  the whole thing at the top
[53:54.000 --> 54:01.600]  mid-level and low-level it's not they're not in complete control the matrix is not complete
[54:01.600 --> 54:07.200]  we're not out of the game at the top it's all standardized and the system is trying to get us
[54:07.200 --> 54:14.080]  to basically enter into their totally artificial environment that's why all over the u.s england
[54:14.080 --> 54:20.240]  and canada they're fining people in major cities for backyard gardens if you're a listener just
[54:20.240 --> 54:24.400]  type it into the search engine i'm not kidding but guys type in uh
[54:26.880 --> 54:33.040]  swat team for growing cucumbers you'll get canada you'll also get the u.s because they say
[54:33.040 --> 54:39.040]  in tulsa oklahoma you can't be trusted growing a garden in your backyard it might be drugs
[54:39.040 --> 54:45.120]  you even forbs a few months ago said why are there thousands of raids on lemonade stands
[54:45.120 --> 54:49.600]  why is the federal government obsessed with lemonade stands and giving grants to local
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.560]  police to go after them because your kids have got to be trained everything you do is in a big box
[54:54.560 --> 55:00.400]  store everything you do is in a survey i mean i mean you walk into these box stores disney world

[55:13.120 --> 55:22.480]  and i remember 15 years ago reading about all the major safe ways you name it had hidden retina
[55:22.480 --> 55:28.160]  scanners that were tracking the eye as you look at products now it's admitted that it's in most

[55:34.960 --> 55:40.160]  talk about it they said for one year because they're going to another university into the
[55:40.160 --> 55:42.960]  the into a department of defense laboratory

[59:58.280 --> 01:00:06.120]  network from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.720]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:20.280]  i was just thinking during the break if you were going to practice shutting down cities
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:28.360]  lining people up arresting certain individuals surveilling and tracking the every move of all
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.880]  the others where would you test that you'd test that at disney world
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.560]  and that's how my brain just clicks i'm like department of defense laboratory
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.640]  because i know they're nomenclature boom look it up department of defense laboratory
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:51.560]  department of defense laboratory and again it's not that i'm that smart somebody who's been
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.240]  watching football for 20 years obsessed with it you're gonna know you know as much as the guys
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.000]  on espn or more it's the same thing here i've actually studied what's really being built
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.280]  what's really going on around me and i understand why the average person just goes oh that can't be
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.720]  true because you're taught you can choose your reality you're taught that you can just say oh
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:28.600]  i don't believe this guy but that doesn't change the facts we might as well have little gray-headed
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.880]  aliens with big black eyes like science fiction says running things because the globalists are
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:40.440]  that removed from humanity they're that cold-blooded they're that hateful towards their
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.880]  own species and in their own publications claim they're another species and transcendent and
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.000]  they're going to get their world government we're not going to be part of the future and
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:04.200]  the globalists will get the life extension and only the elites will get the digital augmentations
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.640]  the the pace of change that we are about to see as a society
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.800]  is mind-boggling because we've been in a frozen
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:23.240]  stasis culturally with just slow little incremental changes decoloration changes
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.120]  presentation changes in 30 year old tech that the globalists
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.600]  developed and bought and stole and put together
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.240]  and now they've decided to go ahead and start accelerating a lot of the programs
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.440]  and the change
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  and if they are successful
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.440]  99.9 plus percent of those that help usher in
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:07.640]  will be destroyed will be crippled will be made destitute if they're lucky by it
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:13.640]  but because they are living in a fantasy land because they're receiving false data
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.120]  they won't even know that on the journey they'll think they're winning and they'll think it's a
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.800]  tragic event when they fail and then it's somebody else's fault it's all scripting when you believe
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.920]  anything a liar says you'll believe anything
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.880]  you see sometimes i can't just get up here and cover the news and analyze it
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:44.200]  because even within covering this news we play into the paradigm of the social engineers
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:54.120]  and we're not going to be able to cover the news we're not going to be able to cover the news
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:00.680]  we play into the paradigm of the social engineers
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:07.080]  the way to defeat the new world order is to really awaken to the fact that this civilization
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.680]  to a great extent has been pre-planned
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.360]  i said to a great extent because they're not in complete control they're trying to get incomplete
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:28.840]  control yeah that's the most important point i haven't made it if the globalists get their
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:36.520]  system in place what would the complete control look like
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.960]  look in my eyes you've got a lot of ancestors and all of their experiences
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.880]  you've got intuition you know the truth
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:05:14.360]  i've seen the future and so have you we've got to change it did you ever think you'd be where you

[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:22.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show i tell you what i've uh spent an hour 45 minutes
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:32.680]  minus the commercials kind of segwaying in and out of the heart of my concerns dealing with
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:39.560]  the technocratic elite that are pre-designing our future and our technological development
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.560]  it's very painful to hear talk show hosts talking about steve jobs and all of his uh
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:55.080]  innovations when that is multi-decade old technology and was rolled out according to
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:01.960]  a pre-destined pre-established plan the north american union the asian union the euro
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.760]  all of it developed set up by 1957 with the treaty of rome
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.920]  a contemporary example that i use commonly is the pentagon still claims the sr-71 blackbird
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:19.320]  developed in 1952 and serviced by 1955 is the fastest aircraft to this day in 2012
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.800]  or a more modern example is the b-2
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.600]  bomber stealth bomber
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:37.160]  test models were developed and already deployed in the 1960s it was in service by the 1970s
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.880]  and of course was not revealed to the public until 1987 or was it 88 guys look up uh
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.680]  just do a memory test here i'm a primitive electrochemical system interface it with the
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.800]  silicon version and let's see if we can do it again let's see if we can do it again
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.600]  let's do a memory test here on my primitive electrochemical system interface it with the
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:07.960]  silicon version and let's let's pull up uh the uh b-2 bomber public rollout i believe it was 87 or 88
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:15.480]  perhaps it was 89 now that i think about it let's just find out okay uh continuing here
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:27.160]  reason i'm so concerned let me just give you one small data point of literally hundreds
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:36.040]  on the subject of mass death mass population
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:47.480]  reduction because this is something that i've been talking about for a very very long time
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.240]  with great concern because i've been able in deep research
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:03.720]  to investigate why western governments are building gigantic quasi-secret
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.360]  doomsday uh scenario
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.800]  facilities all over the world why are they building animal and human dna arcs
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:25.000]  in remote areas of the himalayas the arctic the antarctic the frozen tundra
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:34.280]  b-2 rollout was 88 thank you i
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:42.120]  watched the continuity of government system via nato and the united states
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:49.400]  but the russians and chinese are also been obsessed with it spending in some years
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.320]  upwards of ten percent of the entire defense security budgets on building giant underground
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:03.000]  bases with nuclear power underground reservoirs you know people could live under there for 100
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:13.080]  years i watched this and i watched since i became really awake 18 years ago
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:22.680]  quasi-awake 18 years ago i became fully awake 15 i watched and just because you're awake doesn't
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.560]  mean you know everything it means you're now awake you're able to learn i watched this mad
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:35.880]  rush like the end of the world was coming and then i learned because these people leak stuff
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.200]  and and they talk and the and the different academics talk but they're not concerned about
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:47.000]  a meteorite they're not concerned about little green men they're not concerned about even nuclear
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:57.320]  war so much as they are biological weapons and and again if you're driving along your car right
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.040]  now let's say you got your family in the car maybe there's six of you in the vehicle
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.720]  statistically if any of these weapons are released and i'm going to talk about here in a moment
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:12.520]  statistically if any of these are released everyone in the car will be dead now i know
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:19.400]  that's not as important as nfl playoffs but see there won't be any nfl playoffs
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:29.800]  if this happens and i have been discovered in the last five six seven years my research
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:37.160]  is confirmed in triplicate in spades every angle i look at it that they're not building
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:42.680]  these bunkers because they're worried about some rogue group producing and releasing airborne
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:51.160]  ebola with a 94 kill rate or human mousepox with a 99 airborne kill rate or different variants of
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:12:00.520]  bird flu and others with a 91 92 kill rate that's nine out of ten on your block dead end of
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:08.680]  civilization as we know it they're not doing this because they're worried the only thing i have to
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:13.160]  figure out is that they're going to go ahead and release it as they're clearly building up towards
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:20.600]  why they're running around i guess for some future history maybe that's it so they can blame it
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.760]  on out of control biological testing so that once they re-emerge and set up a new civilization
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.560]  they'll have an excuse for a total police state tyranny over all biological and nanotech
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.240]  developments
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.680]  because the entire establishment acts like we don't even exist and they don't even care
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.440]  if we're wise to them and they're just getting ready for the end of the world
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:56.680]  while setting up 36 level 4 bioweapons labs in level 2 and 3 containment and setting up over 200
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:05.160]  other facilities that are barely level 2 that have level 4 weaponized airborne total death being
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:13.160]  developed in them because you know the globalists sell to kind of mid-level minions and establishment
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.120]  types who think world government's like some star trek thing because like baby ducks they were
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:23.160]  imprinted with that that oh it's just a bit you know we all run around in jumpsuits and fly around
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.640]  in jet packs and the global government and have you know hot blonde girlfriends or whatever you
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.200]  know that's in all the different movies and stuff no you're you're dead in that future you don't
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:40.760]  exist they send automated robot crawlers in to pull you out of the underground parking garages
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:47.240]  and and your basements you're not flying around wearing tinfoil outfits in the system okay
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:56.280]  looking at it the only answer there is is they're just passing out all these bio weapons like
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:03.160]  like like dumb dumb suckers at the barber they're handing them out to any government
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.960]  putting the full ingredients the full breakdown how to make all this stuff on the internet
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.280]  because i guess in their weird sick way they're just going to
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:21.800]  let someone else produce it or leak it or have a mistake or claim a terrorist got it and i've seen
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:28.440]  that in other models 2000 foot mouth weaponized england i could tell it was a government operation
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.440]  how i'll give you a data point in a moment several data points but i knew
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.080]  that that was weaponized because in a two-day period it popped up from scotland
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:47.880]  to southern england at hundreds of ranches hundreds of farms they don't you don't have
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:53.800]  a a foot mouth pop up and show up all over the place at once unless it was governmental or major
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:59.560]  corporate launched and sure enough about a year after it happened they killed eight million sheep
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:06.120]  four million cows used it to take over have government control try to break the farms in in in
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.480]  in the uk it came out in the government the bbc and other publications said we believe in animal
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.120]  rights activists who doesn't believe in domesticated animals at this particular
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:22.360]  zoological level four bioweapons facility must have stolen it but that's impossible one man one
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:29.080]  woman or even a group of a few dozen terrorists couldn't get that all over the uk and have it all
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.640]  pop up on a two-day period with a government announcement pr on top of it that's another
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:42.600]  data point the slickness of the announcement but the issue here is that they're probably going to
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.720]  let a low-level group release some airborne system that kills the majority of those that come in
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.320]  contact with it as the excuse to have the bio clamp down police state so they can then release
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.800]  something even more deadly later and i think i've just answered my question right there but they're
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:05.800]  passing it all out hi folks this is alex jones i'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot

[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.920]  overall capital feeds they can buy up and steer development in a direction they want
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:19.000]  but in all the globalist publications and you can pull these up all they talk about is establishing
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:26.280]  a world government and then forcibly reducing our population by at least 80 percent and those
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:33.720]  aren't idle threats by ted turner or dr eric pianka university of texas biology department or
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:39.160]  peter singer at princeton or prince philip or prince charles or the club of rome or
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:44.840]  the un biological diversity assessment 1996 or mori strong
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:49.000]  and anybody who's gone to college knows you've been fed this line about humans being a parasite
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.080]  we got to reduce the numbers this is the religion of those that run the club
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:01.800]  my point is they really intend to try to carry it out all of the the jacking poison in the water
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:09.720]  and cancer viruses and the vaccines and bistrenol a to reduce your fertility estrogen mimicers
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.800]  all of that is just macabre beta testing in this thing
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.080]  i mean where people are poor and don't have media and can't stand up for themselves
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:30.120]  in africa latin america and asia i mean every day i see articles we could pull them up you know 15
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:38.200]  babies die an illegal vaccine test 31 of 50 homeless in poland given shots and so on and so
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:47.560]  on homeless in poland given shot die cbs news government polio vaccine program causing polio
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:52.840]  and i just look at it and if you're a new listener and you were joining us during the last segment
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:23:00.520]  and i'm talking about weaponized super viruses i mean here's the boston club today
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.280]  and i really should be more positive because at least this stuff's being somewhat discussed now
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:14.920]  scientists pause research with lab-bred bird flu it's a super contagious airborne
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.760]  highly lethal bird flu ap reports again posted in the boston club
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:28.360]  scientists who created easier to spread versions of the deadly bird flu said yesterday that they
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.800]  are temporarily halting more research as international specialists debate what should
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:40.840]  happen next now the fbi as you know a month ago told them do not publish as you did with mousepox
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:49.160]  and an airborne ebola and the rest of it do not publish how you made it because in the case of
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:57.960]  mousepox that kills 99 of whatever mammal you tailor it for that that was published
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:08.200]  a couple hundred thousand dollars and you've got the right biochemist you can make it
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.760]  and it's public do you think the fbi spies on the internet because they're scared of somebody with
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:19.320]  the anarchist cookbook only thing they'll do with that's blow your hand off
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:27.800]  we can survive provocateurs idiots numskulls you know bombing a bank or
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:33.000]  something and killing three people it's a tragedy but it won't kill billions
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.680]  and you see some of the higher level academics will say well alex they're setting up a global
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:50.520]  technocracy to stop the release of this stuff no it's the technocrats that are making sure
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:59.880]  that they have weaponized viruses hundreds of them in level two facilities where you wear gloves and
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:06.760]  a mask and swipe a card and a door opens you're supposed to have level four bio weapons in
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:13.480]  underground bases three levels down with three fences with minefields and machine gun nest
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.400]  i mean that's federal law
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:28.040]  you ever seen the andromeda strain that's of course a great medical doctor and writer who
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.840]  put that together it's fiction but it's based on real level four facilities that's a level four
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:42.760]  facility in fact in the old days when they were messing with stuff like this they reportedly had
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:48.920]  hydrogen bombs buried under them because let me explain something if this stuff gets out
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.640]  almost everyone listening to my voice is dead
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:01.960]  and i want to know why the people running the world today
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.760]  are putting level four human and zoological diseases
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.920]  in level two facilities like the university of texas at galveston
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.000]  when they first built it eight years ago i said it could be hit by a hurricane
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.280]  did you know it was hit by a hurricane and pretty much destroyed they claimed that they got the
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:37.320]  viruses out before it hit again i know this is a lot more important than the nfl playoffs that's
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:46.360]  why i'm here and i see a global elite running around 24 7 with private bunkers and government
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:52.200]  bunkers and big corporate bunkers and and and talking about how great it's going to be the age
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.480]  after humans and how the world's going to come back and the futurists say they'll only be a few
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:03.640]  hundred thousand elitist and then it'll be this wonderful age where they repopulate the world and
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:09.640]  build it however they want and they're just like somebody hyping themselves up to jump off a cliff
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:14.840]  300 feet into water they're just getting themselves hyped up to release it and then
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:21.720]  creating a weird pre-nostalgia with all these tv shows and stuff about all humans are about to die
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.560]  and fake self-fulfilling 2012 prophecy garbage and they got the churches saying praise god it's
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.040]  the end of the world and all this stuff it doesn't have to be the end of the world if we wake up to
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:37.240]  what's happening because they're not up to the point of their entire military being robot and
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:44.520]  drone the globalists cannot carry this out yet by themselves they're going to need people that work
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.040]  for the system to carry this out they're not in complete control
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.760]  i'm on well over 100 radio stations
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:00.040]  just on video streaming sites a week it's over five million people now
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.000]  watching and listening to the show a week just just on video streams on
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.240]  youtube and some other platforms i mean we're we're challenging the globalists
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:18.120]  we weren't in their equation because there's not very many of them maybe a few thousand that have
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:24.200]  most of the puzzle a few hundred that know it all and i know why it's so hard for people to
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:32.600]  understand this because it's so diabolical i'm gonna give the number out last week i took pretty

[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:40.520]  now but here's the associated press scientists pause research on basically weaponized lab-bred
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:51.080]  bird flu fears raised over lab-bred airborne strains but notice the main concern is here out
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:34:03.240]  of cbs news in dallas dallas plant investigated for dumping pig blood into trinity river and they
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:09.320]  think that some pig blood out of a slaughterhouse might have run out and dripped in a creek and
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:15.080]  gotten into the river oh my gosh we're all in so much trouble and i'm not saying that that isn't
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:23.240]  important but compared to airborne weapons that under government contracts these universities and
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:33.000]  others are producing where are the priorities you know who's concerned about gmo from monsanto and
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:42.040]  others infecting every soybean every corn every wheat every maize variety as they are and then in
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:48.200]  all the big studies organ failure in the rats that eat it and so it goes and infects all the
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:54.440]  other seed lines and that's not a problem but a couple you know some blood might have gotten a
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:03.560]  river though you know we're all really scared right now that pig blood that's the type of issue
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:09.000]  that we're talking about here while we're worried about something like that the big mega corporations
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.160]  who've basically written the laws and regulations and their people are over all the regulatory
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:20.360]  agencies they're not even getting looked at talking about arrogance you know that cruise line
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:29.240]  disaster i got a story here out of the london telegraph costa concordia insulting crews offered
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:41.400]  to survivors they've offered them a 30 off on their next cruise oh that's funny that is really
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:48.600]  really funny isn't that owned by carnival cruise lines yeah i saw that in the news costa concordia
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:57.320]  but it's it's like a sub-corporation you know that captain's learned from bagdad bob and our
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:03.800]  own criminal government's baloney propaganda spin machine uh when the when the italian coast guard
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:08.440]  ordered him to get back onto the ship and help people get off uh it turned out he ordered dinner
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:14.200]  on the lifeboat though he was having a drink he said oh i fell in the lifeboat on accident but i'm
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:21.320]  not going back and see if you question an authority figure that's called conspiracy theory we've all
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:28.840]  been taught that virtue to never question government or big corporations in fact they should
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:34.200]  have just said the whole wreck was a conspiracy theory just the ships they are sinking on the
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.560]  coast of italy just say it didn't happen and if people show video just say it's not there
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.320]  kind of like i can prove that al-qaeda works for the criminals that run our government
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.720]  that all the major terrorists have been let into the us and are protected from the underwire bomber
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:55.800]  on christmas day to amiral al-laki hanging off the pentagon but but none of that matters it's
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:03.160]  a conspiracy theory so just say the ship never capsized never listed and isn't there just say
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:08.200]  italy doesn't exist because after all remember carl rove's quote about how he controls reality
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.440]  and you've got a public that sees it as a virtue to get conned a
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:21.720]  virtue to get hurt a virtue to follow all this pablum hey look at this one out of politico
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.080]  federal prosecutor to take the fifth amendment and fast and furious probe
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:33.480]  oh it's the prosecutors the guys that get the bad guys the guys that get 98 percent conviction right
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.040]  do you really think 98 percent of people are guilty no the the the for at least 20 years
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:43.880]  uh almost all the federal grand juries are criminals who would send a one-year-old to the
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:52.360]  gas chamber if told to i mean they will convict anyone they're told to okay because who runs
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.080]  these grand juries they're not supposed to but it's the prosecutors
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.760]  and of course it was all in federal filings a year plus ago that's why they came up with
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:09.800]  a cover story of oh we just had some guns at some gun shops in texas and uh and in arizona
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:17.160]  and illinois and some other states we just had some guns that we were letting be sold to track
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.640]  them down to mexican drug gangs of course the federal documents from the beginning in federal
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:27.720]  court that the government declared national security on was that our criminal government
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:33.240]  you know the thing run by the ponzi scheme banks that don't worry you're gonna destroy everything
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.800]  and and don't worry yuppies you like to get hurt you're gonna get hurt so just giggle at the radio
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.560]  have fun don't worry you'll get everything you want it's all real funny to laugh people that
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:49.080]  are informed uh they um they said it was to blame the second amendment and of course i told you that
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.800]  over a year ago but cbs news two months ago reported that oh sure enough the federal documents
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.800]  have now come out in subpoena that it was all meant to blame the second amendment the of course
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:05.320]  that was domestically internationally it was to ship guns into mexico but also texas chicago
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:12.120]  indiana florida to give it to drug gangs that were shooting and killing the other drug gangs
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:19.400]  that weren't laundering their money through big u.s banks which means globalist banks remember uh
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:29.160]  walkovia wels fargo 376 billion last year they reported on in a two-year period
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:35.800]  oh but don't worry they paid a hundred and ten million dollars fine
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.360]  we did the math on that once it's like something like point zero three percent or something
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:51.400]  so i mean why shouldn't they go for broke why shouldn't they do something new why shouldn't
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:59.000]  and again they say that in the land of crazy people the same person is the nut or they say
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:06.440]  in the uh land of the blind the one-eyed man is king maybe i am the crazy one maybe i am the bad
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:12.920]  one because see when the whole government's corrupt at the top and you got a bunch of naive
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.200]  sheep below them that enjoy being hurt and think it's cute and you're winning to repeat what they're
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:26.760]  told talk show hosts and others that if you here's an example if you wanted to arrest a communist or
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:33.240]  a jew or a seventh-day adventist or whatever the case was in 1932 germany for no reason and kill
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.760]  them that would be a felony and you go to prison in germany but see hitler took over and was a
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.240]  tyrant and said it was legal of course you can't really legalize tyranny and common sense but
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.720]  if people go along with it you in a way you can and so he could kill tens of millions of people
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.960]  total and 22 million germans died in the war civilian and military they really got blessed
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:41:00.840]  60 million of them 22 million went bye-bye oh that went well going along they were trendy
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:07.960]  uppies too then they did what the radio and newsreels and newspapers said because you know
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.360]  the terrorists blew up the capital and other stuff of course it was really the nazis but hey it was
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:17.320]  fun to get mad fun to get worried about terrorists you know some polish terrorist oh you know they're
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.400]  all bad oh muslim they're all bad you know it was fun it was fun to have one-third of the germans go
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:30.760]  bye-bye yeah one-third of the germans just oh 22 million at the end of the war bye-bye in germany
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:41.080]  alone oh that went well that went well but but i forgot how i got on the subject of germany oh
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.360]  yeah when your government's run by absolute criminals who compete with each other so the
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:54.760]  very worst get in to the power structure it's just legal for them to ship guns into mexico
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.960]  and then blame it on the second amendment and even when they got caught i said last year watch they'll
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.680]  still use it and you know what they couldn't get congress to pass a law restricting gun sales in
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:10.280]  the u.s so they just the atf just sent letters threatening to arrest gun dealers if they sold
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:19.560]  the rifles and and you know didn't jump through these new hoops and of course the rifles were
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.560]  already all registered to the instant check but they didn't care it was about the atf saying
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:31.320]  you'll do what we say outside of law kind of like the federal government shutting down power plants
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:36.440]  all over the country outside of law congress didn't pass a law but they're doing it obama
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.560]  is launching wars without congress but congress itself signed a law saying i can be arrested you
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.320]  can be arrested and disappear forever be tortured be killed it's called the ndaa
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:51.880]  and don't worry they will use it and they will abuse it all right i haven't even gotten into
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:57.800]  a bunch of other news here but we're gonna come back go to your calls stay with us
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.120]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:13.640]  number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:19.080]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:24.360]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.560]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:34.280]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.640]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:44.040]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science

[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:07.480]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.120]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.200]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.680]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:26.920]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless

[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:08.440]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:20.120]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.040]  all right i got about 20 phone calls here i'm gonna give each person about a minute
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:31.640]  we'll get about 10 or 11 in during this segment i meant to get into the great internet wars have
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:37.160]  begun an article by kurt nemo and myself i'll cover it more tomorrow on the weekday show because
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:42.440]  it isn't just about the internet and and and freedom of the web that's under attack it's the
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:51.320]  entire technological infrastructure that's having back doors and trojan horses built into it we're
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.520]  going to document that tomorrow 11 am central 12 noon eastern if you don't have a local am or fm
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:03.320]  in your area info wars.com is the website uh nate in california you're on the air hey alex how you
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:09.640]  doing buddy good yeah so yeah i'd like to talk about maybe the tv um i think that's a big problem
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.600]  obviously they they sold it to us back when they first invented it as you know they'd have all
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:20.440]  wholesome shows on and it was good we could trust it and then now if you look at it it's obviously
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:27.400]  promoting 180 degree difference and i think that is where a huge problem but it's more than that
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:35.400]  it puts people into a mesmerized near sleep state it's a quasi waking sleeping dream state
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:43.640]  similar to hypnotism yeah yeah you realize the brainwaves overall uh the average person is in
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.920]  a lower brainwave state than they were before television was invented i mean people are actually
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:54.600]  in a trance that's why they won't listen to you yep and it's sad one one thing about ron paul if
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:00.680]  i could um i believe he's the only one that is electable because yeah if newt gingrich or
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:05.800]  romney gets in he's only going to get the far extreme right i mean we need somebody like ron
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.600]  paul that's going to get a democrat and an independent and a republican so well you're
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.400]  right you're right nate the polls show that ron paul does better than any other republican
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:21.640]  candidate head-to-head gallop and others show this against obama but more than that
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:26.520]  he's the only real candidate that isn't bought and paid for by the globalist
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.200]  right yeah i know i i see that 100 but i'm just trying i try to tell that to newt gingrich
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:37.400]  supporters you know and all that kind of thing but sure i hear you i'm going to jump good points
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:42.200]  the average talk show host just repeats the talking point that ron paul can't win
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:46.760]  as a self-fulfilling prophecy and thinks that they're a winner because they go along with the
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.320]  propaganda that he can't win and then when he doesn't win they're satisfied and feel like
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.760]  they're winners and that's a self-fulfilling prophecy of fraud and ron paul's really freaked
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:02.040]  him out being in second place in most polls uh the fact that he's basically bucked all that
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:07.720]  but it's a manifestation of the awakening great points nate robbie in new york here on the year
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:14.360]  hey how you doing alex good uh yeah newt gingrich just kind of came out of nowhere
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:19.960]  uh last night didn't he with the uh primary there yeah we've got an article in infowars.com
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:25.400]  concerning what looks like fraud we know iowa was fraud that's in their local papers now that
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.680]  uh the iowa thing is completely in the air and um carl rove says they're going to have a gentleman's
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:37.960]  agreement on who gets the delegates so yeah uh and and it's funny they put paul down in fourth
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:43.480]  as if as if somehow santorum romney and gingrich all all managed to beat him i don't believe that
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:48.200]  for one for one second you know well we've had top elections experts on and they say south
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:55.560]  carolina is just fraud central yep but uh one more thing uh it looks like uh isa you know how
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:03.160]  isa you know how he's a former atf uh head he uh he's kind of acting like he's you know want
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:09.000]  he's he's trying to act like he's actually trying to get some answers but at the same time you know
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.920]  he's trying to protect you know the past administration and whatnot so
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:18.600]  he's putting up a show that he's actually trying to prosecute these guys and at the same time he's
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:25.320]  not really he's not really doing anything about it you know i mean i don't know look look look
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:32.840]  look i said months before it was announced that is uh what was going to have to basically stop
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:40.120]  his investigation because fast and furious under other names was going on under bush under clinton
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.360]  iran contra wasn't the first time our government shipped guns out and drugs in
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:53.560]  they shipped the guns out to the to the gangs to control the supply it's 500 billion dollars a year
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.800]  the big banks wander it the government brings it in and the only people they shut down are
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:03.000]  the small cartels that don't launder their money through them they made drugs illegal our government
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.680]  made drugs illegal in the 30s because alcohol prohibition had ended and the corrupt government
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:14.040]  had made so much money off alcohol prohibition they wanted something new and and and and again
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:20.280]  by having an illegal at jacks the price is up a but more importantly b it allows them to send the
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.440]  police after their competition great points i appreciate your call and of course he's getting
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:30.360]  the point of federal prosecutors taking the fifth amendment in fast and furious probe and nothing's
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:36.200]  going to happen to them folks they they did what they were told i mean the u.s government doesn't
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.080]  just run drugs they run kidnap kids and if you don't know about that just just type it in i mean
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:46.680]  there's congressional hearings and i've watched congressional c-span where congress people say
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:51.080]  well this this company kidnaps little kids and they go yes they do and they're allowed to
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:57.960]  and they go no one gets in trouble they go nope i mean it's it's you can type that in rumsfeld
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:03.960]  questioned on child sex trafficking type that into youtube and he goes nope they don't get in trouble
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:11.080]  and the congress people go so nothing's gonna happen he goes nope and they go okay i mean
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.240]  they're gonna bring the drugs in they're gonna put cancer viruses in your shots
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.600]  they're gonna do whatever they want
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:23.400]  i mean have you not figured this out yet they do what they want because you're naive
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.680]  people say well then why are you still alive because if they kill me it highlights everything
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.840]  i've said it puts an exclamation point behind it and they still might and quite frankly i don't
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:39.640]  want to die but i don't care i'll never commit suicide i'll tell you that but i mean you know
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:44.840]  somebody's going to stand up to this scum and let me explain why they're so evil once the system
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:49.960]  gets criminal across the board one group of criminals can't tell the other group hey you're
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:55.880]  going too far because the other group will say hey you're involved in crime i'll rat you out if
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:03.400]  you go public so once you get a systemically corrupt society the sky's the limit they can't
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:10.040]  tell du weapons lobbyists hey this wasn't used until 1990 it kills all our troops that use it
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:14.920]  may take 20 years but it kills them you can't use that they go hey you're running drugs and kidnapping
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:21.880]  kids shut up yeah but uh we're gonna have to pay for insurance claims on all these troops don't
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:28.200]  worry we'll have a department of justice agreement letter 1998 that you don't have to give any of the
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:33.800]  dead troops any of their death benefits that's ap bloomberg i mean so the whole thing starts
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:44.040]  crumbling where the criminals just go party time and they go wild and that's now happened and you
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:49.640]  i look at the naive public i mean they're helpless i'm in stores and places and i look at these
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:53.320]  fathers who are wearing their tough guy shirts with their kids i went to the pet store today
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:58.280]  and i was watching dads walking around looking at other men with their eyes i'm powerful you know
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:03.240]  how powerful i am i'm like are you powerful enough to know what's going on in your food and water
