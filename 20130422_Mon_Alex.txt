[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[00:20.000 --> 00:30.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today. Obviously, there are a lot of big world events we're going to be breaking down, and a lot of huge news stories that have been ignored,
[00:57.000 --> 01:08.000]  because of the tragic bombing attacks in Boston, and now the ensuing government power grab orgy that is going on.
[01:08.000 --> 01:22.000]  The total wide open border amnesty, 800 page plus bill, CISPA passing the house, Russian or Chinese file net censorship, in the words of tech analyst Declan McCullough at CNET News,
[01:22.000 --> 01:34.000]  I mean even Google says it's draconian. That is rocketed through the house. Homeland security to be given even more autonomous power from the more and more ceremonial Congress.
[01:34.000 --> 01:48.000]  Manipulations of gold downward. Definitely the big mega banks are using paper gold in naked shorts to drive down the physical gold to hide the inflationary thing going on with paper currencies.
[01:48.000 --> 01:59.000]  We've got that, we've got federal furloughs hitting nation's biggest airports, and we've got all the latest on the bombing. It is all coming up today.
[01:59.000 --> 02:11.000]  And former NSA analyst and before that submarine warfare expert, and of course he worked for a bunch of other big companies and has been reporting on congressional national security issues for over a decade.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  Wayne Madsen is going to be giving us his take on this situation, and we also have Joel Skousen on who was on a few days after this happened last week.
[02:21.000 --> 02:34.000]  Also a national security analyst of substantive gravitas. Joel Skousen will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the transmission today to give us his take on all of this.
[02:34.000 --> 02:44.000]  But regardless of whether this is a staged event or not, you know this power structure is coming after your liberty, coming after your freedom.
[02:44.000 --> 02:54.000]  You know that, and you know they're going to sell tens of billions of dollars of robots, and you know they're going to sell more armored vehicles.
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  And you know the military industrial complex, most of it foreign, is going to use this to turn America upside down.
[03:00.000 --> 03:12.000]  Now, obviously day one it happened, I said let's look for drills, let's look for stand downs, let's look for multiple patsy grips, let's look for setups, and let's follow who they say they believe it is.
[03:12.000 --> 03:22.000]  And the media said it's going to be a right-winger lone wolf, and they said okay they've been in arrest, our word is right-wing lone wolf, you gun owners are going to get the blame, we got you.
[03:22.000 --> 03:36.000]  But because of all the photos out there, I think the evidence is clear, they said okay we haven't been in arrest, we're letting the person go, we're shutting the courthouse down, panic, you know kick the media out, and then they the next day bring out the patsy photos.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  And people are like oh but they said they had a firefight with them.
[03:39.000 --> 03:50.000]  Now witnesses, and these articles are up at infallwars.com, say no the naked guy being put in the car was the older brother, no they later saw him get run over by the police.
[03:50.000 --> 03:59.000]  And then you notice the younger brother gets out of the boat, climbs out of the boat, and then minutes later is getting what looks like a tracheotomy, and now he can't talk too good.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  And I'm sure after enough electroshock therapy he'll say whatever they want.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  These guys clearly, and this fits the exact demo we've seen, are double agents, triple agents.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  In the Israeli press, Deb Kefil is saying that.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  Now people will say how dare you say it wasn't a totally staged deal.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  That is a staged deal.
[04:16.000 --> 04:26.000]  I mean 7-7 they were young secular style Muslims mainly, liberals who it looked like were getting extra paychecks with MI-5 and MI-6, well that came out.
[04:26.000 --> 04:34.000]  And were being handled by a SWAT, a high level Al Qaeda operative who was also MI-6 and is still allowed to travel in and out of England.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  He reportedly was their handler.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  Now that's London Telegraph, Fox News.
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  And again that's just one case I'm giving you. It's the same story over and over again.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Look at Benghazi arming the Al Qaeda.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  Look at what they're doing right now in Libya and Syria.
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  And then when they attack us, it's like hey, come out of your house with your hands up.
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.000]  We have video coming up of citizens coming out with their hands up in their homes with the cops aiming guns at them.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  That is totally illegal and a bunch of bull and a power grab.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here it is.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  The Cal Bend Soap Company.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  Alex's staff have been using these all natural earth friendly pure soaps for years and they are the best.
[05:20.000 --> 05:29.000]  See them on the web at www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Then order the sampler, one to two month supply.

[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  Earth friendly and all American.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  Their soaps are made from vegetable and coconut oils.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  Call 1-800-340-7091 or visit www.5starsoap.com.
[05:51.000 --> 05:58.000]  Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated.
[05:58.000 --> 06:08.000]  See it on the web at www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[06:08.000 --> 06:15.000]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[06:15.000 --> 06:23.000]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[06:23.000 --> 06:33.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Younggevity.
[06:39.000 --> 06:47.000]  The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible.

[07:08.000 --> 07:17.000]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold and weapons.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:14.000 --> 08:30.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[08:30.000 --> 08:40.000]  We're here live on the radio, simulcasting video at Infowarsnews.com and prisonplanet.tv and we return every weeknight.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern with Infowars Nightly News.
[08:44.000 --> 08:59.000]  I want to try to be calm here and then open the phones up to take your phone calls until the bottom of the next hour when Wayne Madsen, journalist, award-winning researcher, former NSA analyst, joins us, National Security Agency analyst.
[08:59.000 --> 09:10.000]  And then Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, Marine Corps aviator, researcher, nephew of Cleon Skousen, obviously, and the naked communist.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  He is going to be joining us as well to give us his latest breakdown on all of this.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  The big question is where to begin today?
[09:23.000 --> 09:34.000]  I told you over the weekend what the big news would be that Glenn Beck was going to be putting out about the Saudi Arabian and it's that the White House is involved in a cover-up.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  Now, they could be doing that cover-up to create a rabbit trail to Saudi Arabia.
[09:39.000 --> 09:49.000]  Even though the foreign Saudi press is reporting the Saudi gentleman that was injured, the young man, is hooked into the royal family and did get visited by Michelle Obama.
[09:49.000 --> 09:59.000]  And there was an emergency meeting with a Saudi foreign minister and the files of this guy are being altered and changed.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  That's coming out and they are planning to deport them.
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  They are planning to deport them.
[10:07.000 --> 10:18.000]  So dead men tell no tales and people deported back to their own country, obviously, will tell no tales, at least where the media can pick it up here.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  Now, all that said, I'm going to address that later because I put a video out on it yesterday, predicted what will be released because it was already released.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  It was already in the news last Friday that the White House is covering the shop in a bunch of other newspapers.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  And it's already in the news that the White House is acting very suspicious.
[10:38.000 --> 10:51.000]  Now, getting away from that report right now and getting into the big issues that we're looking at right now, we can punch this up for TV viewers.
[10:51.000 --> 11:04.000]  The aunt says that the older brother, she says the naked man in the video being seen put in the patrol car, is him.
[11:04.000 --> 11:16.000]  The other brother was partying and, you know, the night before all this happened, like he normally did, you know, drinking and smoking pot and stuff, according to his friends, was not a practicing Muslim, by the way.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  But they were pretty full of themselves, had a lot of extra money.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  You also, again, now have witnesses in the local news.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  These articles and videos are up on Infowars.com.
[11:28.000 --> 11:45.000]  We're going to be breaking those down, saying that, again, they tend to throw news articles up on screen.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  I tend to look at those articles, start reading those articles and getting distracted.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  The article I want to put up, is my computer punched up right here?
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  Because this is the one I want to put up here.
[11:53.000 --> 12:03.000]  Yeah, the aunt claims naked man in video is him, and then you look at the video and you see the face on the person going into the car.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  It looks just like them.
[12:05.000 --> 12:18.000]  And then you've got other local news and witnesses reporting that the police ran him over in the car and sat there pumping rounds into him on the ground.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  And if you look at what happened to the other brother, he's reportedly in the boat.
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  I was listening to the police scanner live five minutes before I went live Friday night at about 6.50.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  I went on early because I was listening to the police scanner via Ustream, actually watching it.
[12:35.000 --> 12:44.000]  The guy had the Ustream set up there in Boston with the scanners, with millions, two million people were listening to it when I was watching it, with the camera on the scanner.
[12:44.000 --> 12:59.000]  And the police were freaking out that media had gotten into a warehouse across a body of water nearby and were videotaping what was going on with live feeds.
[12:59.000 --> 13:10.000]  And obviously you then started seeing that on the news, and then they pumped a bunch of bullets, looks like hundreds of bullets if you look at the boat, into it, obviously trying to kill him.
[13:10.000 --> 13:19.000]  Then they get over there and then the police are panicking because now media they tried to keep out had footage of what was happening.
[13:19.000 --> 13:28.000]  So they pumped hundreds of rounds in, obviously trying to kill him, then he stands up miraculously.
[13:28.000 --> 13:36.000]  And don't worry though, five minutes later he's being traked and they're cutting into his throat to save him.
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  And then they've sedated him, and then now he's reportedly, and again all these articles I'm mentioning are up on Infowars.com.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  Then they start interrogating him now, the special national security feds that are there.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  These are people on record that will torture children in front of their parents to get fake confessions.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built until four years after he was already in jail.
[14:03.000 --> 14:13.000]  He might have confessed to killing Jesus 2,000 years ago. He might have confessed to killing Lincoln and blowing up the Lusitania and firebombing the Reichstag in Germany in 1933.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  He might have confessed to being mean to Santa Claus one Christmas morning.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  Again, fake confessions, fake news, fake WMDs, fake, fake, fake.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  Now, again there's so many data points here, I'm going to try to go over all of these for you, but here's what we know.
[14:32.000 --> 14:47.000]  The FBI five years ago visited the families of these young men to cover their butts, as they normally do, to create a history and a ledger that they were indeed watching the older brother and then recently the younger brother.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  Two and a half years ago in 2011, they visited them because the Russians blew their cover.
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  That's what the Russians do and said, we're putting in a national security Interpol complaint on these brothers going to Dagestan and going to Chechnya.
[15:03.000 --> 15:11.000]  And by the way, they're using aliases and we know that through Interpol.
[15:11.000 --> 15:25.000]  Because the West has spent billions of dollars in Dagestan and in Chechnya and in surrounding areas funding what is known as the Jihadi Wahhabist Crescent.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  And they have a man known as the Chechnyan Bin Laden, guys type in Chechnyan Bin Laden.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  This is who, this is who the brothers went to try to make contact with.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.000]  And so they could get in and out of the country, magically they were able to get on aircraft and things with fake names.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  And now there's a whitewash going on that.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  Now, I told you it would end up that they had intelligence connections, not just FBI visits.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Now, you want to go further?
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  Because this is the biggest piece of the puzzle of hundreds that no one is even talking about.
[15:58.000 --> 16:07.000]  The FBI had them under surveillance for five years, probably CIA or maybe even foreign intelligence running these guys.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  Again, who's funding Al Qaeda publicly?
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.000]  Again, who just gave 100 plus million dollars last week to the Syrian rebels, the State Department?
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  It's over a billion dollars now total in the last two and a half years they've given them publicly.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  That's known Al Qaeda being funded to, again, take over countries.
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  What is the West doing to Russia?
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  Radicalizing Muslims, but also sending in infiltrators to keep tabs on them.
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  And who do they use?
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  Young men from England and the United States and Germany.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  Now, these guys suddenly had money.
[16:40.000 --> 16:47.000]  They suddenly, you know, they were flashy, always dressing like playboys, going through women like they were Cracker Jacks.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  These are not practicing Muslims.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  And that's why their father says it's a setup and that they've been set up.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[16:57.000 --> 17:09.000]  This is just like Mohammed Atta, you know, at the strip bar two nights before, who it turns out, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  It turns out, ladies and gentlemen, that these guys were absolutely being protected.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  So let's go over.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  Let's go over this for everybody here.
[17:18.000 --> 17:25.000]  The FBI is saying did not know who they were. Here are their photos. Help us find them.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  We don't know who they are. Here's video. Here's photos.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  We don't know who they are.
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  And I could watch the video and say there is clearly a Fed putting his earpiece in and talking.
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  And because these guys all think they're James Bond, they act overly tough and cool into the role.
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.000]  You see the cops all posing and sticking their jaws out as they order citizens out of their houses at gunpoint.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  This is all part of drama queening.
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  And there's feds in that video they released clearly drama queening playing the part of secret agent.
[17:55.000 --> 18:09.000]  When they should have had their shirts hanging out, should have been picking their nose, should have been sitting there with a whiskey bottle, you know, in a bag and then like picked up a phone and dialed it like they were mentally ill, then you wouldn't have been spotted feds.
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  You should have been sitting there with trash all over the ground up against that wall with a beer can.
[18:15.000 --> 18:23.000]  Instead, you're playing secret agent. I mean, you guys are a joke because it's all part of your template that you're you've arrived.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  You're I mean, I go to 007 movies and stuff.
[18:26.000 --> 18:34.000]  And like half the theater is filled with cops. I went to Olympus has fallen and it was just full of cops, full of cops.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  And I'm walking out. I said, hey, you're cops.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  And they're like, how do you know that, Jones? And I'm like, come on.
[18:41.000 --> 18:53.000]  Look at your body language. You're in here for your brainwashing download of the imaginary terrorists that are everywhere and your Hercules fighting the seven headed Hydra.
[18:53.000 --> 19:07.000]  I mean, you're there in a brainwashing chamber being brainwashed to be given ancestral programming, psychological programming of simulated terror attacks that do not exist.
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  And the cops have like tears in their eyes in these movies and cops are listening.
[19:11.000 --> 19:19.000]  You know, you go into it and they're all sitting back watching in the theater while the real war, by the way, is going on all around you.
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  You go and you watch Batman fight the terrorist. I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[19:23.000 --> 19:31.000]  And that's all this is. So I want to try to regroup. I mean, I'm doing a pretty good job, I think, but it's just my mind is exploding in thousands of directions and try to just give you the timeline.
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.000]  That's probably the best way. I did a great presentation right before I went live on air.
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  I was had Rob do recording me so we can get all the documents together to get me ready for a special report tonight on the nightly news.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  And I recorded it onto his iPhone audio of the whole timeline. And I just I just gave dozens of points.
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  And then once I get on air, I've only gone over basic ones. But I haven't I haven't gotten to the big enchilada yet or I didn't point it out properly.
[19:56.000 --> 20:03.000]  They knew who these guys were when they released their photos to you. Oh, help us. Here's the only guys you have to look at.
[20:03.000 --> 20:08.000]  Who are they? You know who they are. They were at least double agents.
[20:08.000 --> 20:18.000]  You've heard about our MRE Smorgasbord. Now, Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe and longest lasting way to stash emergency food.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  The Eat Pod. Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps, low moisture and low oxygen.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  If you're storing in a basement too humid, garages and attics too hot.
[20:30.000 --> 20:38.000]  But the waterproof double walled high density polyethylene patent pending Eat Pod is a unique roll away food bunker that creates the perfect conditions,
[20:38.000 --> 20:48.000]  can be buried up to 30 feet and can keep your survival food supply safe, secure, dry and virtually undetectable for 25 years or more.
[20:48.000 --> 20:57.000]  Get full details on the Eat Pod at eatpod.com spelled EATPOD.com or call 800-601-2833.

[21:07.000 --> 21:14.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[21:14.000 --> 21:22.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[21:22.000 --> 21:30.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven. But what do you do when the U.S. Government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[21:35.000 --> 21:45.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights and measures.
[21:45.000 --> 21:53.000]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237. Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free. Call 800-686-2237.
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[22:14.000 --> 22:21.000]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[22:21.000 --> 22:32.000]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[22:32.000 --> 22:43.000]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[22:43.000 --> 22:54.000]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[23:07.000 --> 23:17.000]  Those in front of Congress right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms. If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted, or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[23:17.000 --> 23:25.000]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them. What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away. You can protect your guns from any threat.

[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  Sergeant Dave Scott, Army search and rescue veteran, wants you to hear this urgent message.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  All emergencies have casualties, but in America, most casualties from storms like Katrina and Sandy only happen because good people were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Don't let that happen to you. Visit www.yourbugoutplan.com on the web.

[23:58.000 --> 24:06.000]  You owe it to yourself and to your family to watch this. Head to www.yourbugoutplan.com. On the web right now www.yourbugoutplan.com.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  You can go down an entire city and come door to door aiming guns at you and going in your house without a warrant.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  That's called public safety. Actually, it's called martial law.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  This is the end. They sure needed to hunt down both brothers and kill them.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  And they sure thought they'd killed him after they pumped hundreds of rounds into the boat.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  But unfortunately, I was listening to the police scanner live via Ustream from Boston.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  They were like, oh, my gosh, the media has got a fix on the boat.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  Get in there and get that media out of there. But.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  Then the younger brother.
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  Climbed up out of it. And climbed out.
[25:13.000 --> 25:21.000]  And so. They were unable to, I guess, burn him down or shoot him like they did Dorner to make sure we never find out what really happened.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  So then they had to get him down on the ground and do, I guess, a tracheotomy, it looked like on it to make sure they said he may never be able to talk.
[25:27.000 --> 25:33.000]  But he's communicating with investigators. I'm sure he'll he'll confess very quickly.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  They have to the waterboard his mother in front of him.
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  And again, I'm not saying they might not have actually been part of the drill, planted something.
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  They could even be real double triple agents, as Deborah File in Israel is reporting.
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  But what I told you is now confirmed there was a big fat drill with 400 military.
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  Just National Guard, a bunch of other military in plainclothes, FBI, 2000 police.
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  On that route and hundreds of them at the end, and it didn't protect you, so I don't want to lose my rights.
[26:09.000 --> 26:17.000]  And by the way, the martial law isn't what caught him. It was outside the search cordon area of much of the city.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  And it turned out finally after the people were allowed out of their lockdown, it's all prison planet training.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  You're locked down when they stay in the city now. Don't come out of your homes for your security, terrorists are in the area.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  That's how they live in communist and fascist countries.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  They just announce when you can't come out of your home or when there's a daytime or nighttime curfew, but it's all for your safety, of course.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  It's all for your safety, of course.
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  It's all to stop the drug dealers too, when the government ships the drugs in.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  They create the crisis to offer the solution to run our lives.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  And then the neighbor looks out and sees the boat and sees the blood on it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:05.000]  And because the lockdown had been lifted, he wouldn't dare go out while the lockdown was on.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  He sat there and looked at the blood on the boat and everything and waited.
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  And when the lockdown was over, he went out to look and thought he saw somebody in there, so he went and called the police.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  He followed his orders. Man, I'm telling you, the police announced, you're locked down in Austin, do not leave your home.
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  You know what? I'm going to go out. I've had enough of the stinking government.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  By the way, you're running Al-Qaeda and everybody knows it.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  130 something mil. You guys pull up this Associated Press, it's from my stack yesterday.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  130 plus mil given to the Syrian rebels last week.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  Al-Qaeda murdering Christians in mass.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  And then here's the big smoking gun of a bunch of them.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  I'm going to try to walk through this. I'm going to do the timeline in the next segment.
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  I'm so wound up today.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  US providing, excuse me, 123 million more in aid.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  That's politico.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  I guess the last funding was 130 million.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  To Al-Qaeda.
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  You know, I wish somebody locked Washington down and we could arrest all the criminals there.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  You know, it's one thing the police say, we believe a bank robber is on this block.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  Please don't come out of your home in this area.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  But when you lock down an entire, most of a city and then outside the city, it's a joke, folks.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  It's a bunch of grandstanding.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  Military coming to your house, coming in.
[28:27.000 --> 28:34.000]  And I've got all these videos up on Infowars.com of pointing guns at people.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  And it's all part of their cult.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Government always creates cults of doing what we say.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  And finally, every culture says, bring your first born up to the temple.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  We're going to cut their heart out tomorrow.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  And people say government said so.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  So you bring your little kid, the druids, you bring your little kid out to a bonfire.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  That's where the term bonfire comes from.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  They'd have it sizzling hot.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  And they'd grab the kid by the arms and legs.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  Usually like 10-year-olds.
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  That was one of the most popular with the druids.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  You know, young boy.
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  And one, two, three.
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.000]  Throw him into a big fire.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  Isn't that nice?
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  And government said so.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  I mean, they're doing it for your safety.
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  The crops won't grow if you don't do it.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  We come back, I'm going to settle down and go through it all.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  I've got to just settle down here.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  By the way, thousands of nine-month-old babies reportedly butchered
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  until the sewage lines always had to be pumped out with their little parts.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  And guess who?
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  When I saw this, I didn't believe it.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  I went and looked it up and it's true.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  Guess who owns the abortion clinic where they would put babies in the toilet
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  to drown and they would struggle and try to swim and fight with their lives.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  Oh, guess who?
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  The attorney general.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  Anything dirty and bad, they're involved in it.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Fast and furious, you know, but they wouldn't be involved in this.
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.000]  We're on the march.
[29:58.000 --> 30:01.000]  The empire's on the run.

[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  Tyranny is here.
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  The United States is now recognized globally
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship,
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  The police state isn't coming.

[33:12.000 --> 33:14.000]  We are on the march.
[33:14.000 --> 33:17.000]  The empire is on the run.
[33:17.000 --> 33:36.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  Thank you so much for joining us and we are showing video to TV viewers
[33:47.000 --> 34:00.000]  of what looks like about 20 police firing en masse with 223s and 308s
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  over and over and over again into the boat
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  waiting about an hour and 45 minutes for him to bleed to death.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  By the way, there's even more of this footage but it has cuss words over it
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  so we're only seeing about half of it of the sustained fire
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.000]  where it appears they load and reload their clips three or four times.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  Let's be conservative, 15 officers or so.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  You can see a whole line of flashes or it looks about 50 yards
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  firing into the boat, hopefully killing patch C number two.
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  While telling everyone that they sure wanted him to be alive.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  And then, of course, you've got the other brother.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  You've got the other brother.
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  Reportedly now witnesses are saying we have these videos up on Infowars.com
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  that they saw the police run over him and then fill his body full of holes
[34:57.000 --> 35:04.000]  and the aunt and others are saying that it is video of the older brother,
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  Tamerlan, being brought naked into the police car.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  And then I guess you just stage a firefight and then say that you killed him.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  Again, we're seeing all the signs just like with Dorner where they said
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  we're going to burn this mother effer up.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  Yeah, burn down that cabin, burn it down.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  And then, okay, we've got the fire placing the fire.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  It's on fire, good, mission completed.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  We burned him down and a big celebration.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  And then we reported it and the news said
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  There is no audio of them saying burn it down.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  That was that night.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  Then the next day they said, well, they said burn down the cabin,
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  burn that mother effer down, but that doesn't mean burn it.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  Now, who's the conspiracy theorist?
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  Who's the liar and who isn't?
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  You all heard them on six different feeds,
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  three different individuals talking about burning the mother effer down.
[36:00.000 --> 36:09.000]  And it is the same story here, here yet again,
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  here yet again today, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:13.000 --> 36:23.000]  We are seeing the same thing happen with continued rapidity.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  Now, again, here's the giant trillion pound enchilada.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  They told you, here's the photos.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  We've got to show you these photos.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  We've got to go over these photos
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  because we don't know who these people are
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  and we need your help finding them.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  But don't look at any of the other photos of the obvious drill
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  and obvious other patsies.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  And they've come out now, the FBI, and said,
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  we didn't want people looking at other stuff.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  It was going to cause a problem.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  Oh, yes, I know it was because you lied about there being a drill.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  And they're lying to people saying they didn't know who they were.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  Here are the articles.
[37:00.000 --> 37:09.000]  Boston bomber, FBI dropped the ball over Tamerlan.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  The FBI was alerted by Russian security services
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  to serious new concerns about one of the Boston bomb suspects
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  as recently as November.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  It was claimed on Sunday night.
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  And since then, the FBI has indeed admitted to all of that.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  And of course, they were talking to their family about them for five years.
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  The Russians blew their cover two and a half years ago saying,
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  why are you letting these guys go in and out of these terrorist controlled areas?
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  We think this guy is suspicious.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  They should, Kurt Nemo wrote an article about it on Sunday,
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  actually Saturday, about the State Department funding
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  billions of dollars to the bin Laden of Chechnya
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  that this gentleman, brother number one, the older dead brother,
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  Dead Men Tell No Tales, that he reportedly worked with.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  So he reportedly was under the influence
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  and was inspired by Chechen warlord on State Department payroll
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  who the FBI had been following and talking to now for five years.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  Five years, five years, five years.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  By the way, the family said five years
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  before they admitted two and a half years
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  and now five years is confirmed.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  So they were on these guys forever.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  But they released photos and videos saying,
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  gee, we don't know who they are
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  when you can see feds watching them in the doorway as they walk by.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  Was Boston bomber inspired by Russia's bin Laden?
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  Mother claims FBI tracked older brother for five years
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  after told by Moscow of links to Chechen terrorists.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  Well, yeah, Moscow was blowing his cover.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  That's how agencies get rid of somebody
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  without killing them and starting a new cold war
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  is they simply say, hey, here's your agents, knock it off.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Now, it gets worse.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Here is the Huffington Post and here is Politico.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  But they hide this in plain view.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Representative Mike Rogers,
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  Tamerlan may have traveled to Russia under an alias.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  Under an alias.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  Mike Rogers, the older brother may have traveled to Russia
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  under an alias and it's not really Russia.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  It's to Uzbekistan and to Chechnya
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  and the Russians came and said this guy,
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  this guy looks like he's one of your people.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Get him out of here.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  Lindsey Graham says wrong name hid the Russia trip.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  Oh, the senator is helping us understand
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  exactly why that happened.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  It is so frustrating.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  I mean, can't there ever be a bombing where,
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  let me show TV viewers and for radio listeners,
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  I will simply give you the headline on this.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  You can see it all for yourself.
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  Chair expert, London bombings mastermind is MI6 asset.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  We have that article saved.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  It was from the London Daily Telegraph
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  and then there's Fox News under it.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  You just search MI6 agent 77 bombings.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  77 London bomber, MI6 agent.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  That was by the way, John Loftus,
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  former head of counter-terrorism for the FBI.
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.000]  Oh, so there's just some of the headlines.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  Democratic underground, London bombing mastermind,
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  an MI6 agent.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  Daily Mail MI6 told agent it couldn't kill Al-Qaeda.
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  London bombing ringleader Haroon Rashid Aswat double agent.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  He wasn't a double agent.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  He was allowed to fly in and out of the country
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  for years after the bombing
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.000]  and it turned out is an MI6 officer.
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  Not an asset, not an agent, an officer.
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  Let me say it again.
[41:14.000 --> 41:21.000]  An officer of MI6 commanded, commanded, to quote Destro,
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  all you cops think you're GI Joe,
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  you actually work for Cobra.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  But look how simple that is, that you work for Cobra
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  and you don't even know it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  The government is Cobra.
[41:40.000 --> 41:47.000]  We here at Cobra so chaos to bring order and weapon sales.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  See, it's all a big joke, all in your face.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  Look how the police dress like Cobra
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  and all the children watching that,
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  everybody thought Cobra was cooler.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  You were all being imprinted,
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  all being imprinted with predictive programming.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  Cobra brings in a world government.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  Cobra gets rid of gold, brings in cashless systems.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  Cobra brainwashes kids through television.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  Have you watched those old 80s cartoons?
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  Cobra currency.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Hail Cobra.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  That's what the intelligence agencies are.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  They run the narcotics, they run the snuff films,
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  they run the little kids, they run all of it
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  and they get caught running all of it
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  and it doesn't even matter
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  and they get caught running these guys
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  and I said, whoever these patsies are,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  they're gonna kill them.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  But they pumped, I don't know.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  If you blow that video up where they're shooting,
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  it goes on for about 40 seconds
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  and there's a line of guns that looks like
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  it's about 50 yards long back through the trees.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  You can see the flashes
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  and you can tell they're firing from drums,
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  they're firing from 30 around mags
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  and you can see some of the guns stopping for a second,
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  two seconds as they reload, firing, firing,
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  probably 60 rounds to 100 rounds per person into that boat
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  and folks, show the bullet-ridden boat.
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.000]  Just type in bullet-ridden boat or the terrorist boat
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  and I mean, there are bullet holes from 308 and 223
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  every half inch of the entire boat.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  Now, what was the mission there?
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  Did they go pump tear gas in and say,
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  come out with your hands up?
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  By the way, the witnesses say he didn't shoot at them
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  with his quote, carbine, he was hiding in there
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.000]  and they pulled up and they unloaded
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  because they were told, kill him.
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  That's why they told the media,
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  you cover this, we're gonna kill you.
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  That's why they told citizens,
[43:47.000 --> 43:55.000]  you come out of your house, you're dead.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  All right, let me just do this.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  Let me just take calls and when I start the next hour,
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  I'll do the timeline.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  Because I actually wrote some notes on this
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  and it's just so frustrating.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  But is anybody gonna call the FBI
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  on the big elephant in the room?
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  They lied for five years, not two and a half.
[44:11.000 --> 44:12.000]  They knew who these guys were
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  and these guys clearly had fake identification
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  and were allowed to travel in and out under aliases.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  I've interviewed the head of the US Embassy Visa section.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  Springman, look it up.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  Toronto Star was the first to break it in 2001
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  where they were ordered to let Mohammed Atta
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  and the other 14 hijackers from Saudi Arabia
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  back into the US, they were flagged as terrorists
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.000]  and they said, we're not letting them in
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  and the State Department had the CIA call them
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  and say, those are our agents, our assets.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  They're not terrorists, that's their cover.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  And then we've got Lieutenant Colonel Butler,
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  the head of the Defense Language School at the time,
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  going to the newspaper and saying,
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  five of the hijackers were in my school,
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  Mohammed Atta and two others were in my class for a year.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  Two semesters at the Defense Language School,
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  two years before 9-11, he knew Mohammed Atta,
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  he drank coffee with Mohammed Atta at the commissary
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  and had lunch with him.
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  Mohammed Atta sat two rows back
[45:13.000 --> 45:19.000]  for two semesters and all the Colonel said is,
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  folks, the government was involved in this,
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  these guys are patsies.
[45:23.000 --> 45:31.000]  Those hijackers on the news are US government trained.
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  Now that's San Jose Mercury News,
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  that's Associated Press.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  If the media is listening before all the White House organs,
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  because look, I know you work for the White House,
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  the White House media matters and all the rest of you,
[45:43.000 --> 45:44.000]  it's on record you do.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  But most of you aren't real terrorists,
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  most of you aren't real criminal globalists.
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  You probably wouldn't hurt the neighbor's dog
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  if you were offered a million dollars.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  But see, just denying all this doesn't make you not guilty.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  When you sit here and go Alex the crazy,
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  says the government, ran the 9-11 hijackers,
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  I don't know what really happened
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  once they got on those airplanes.
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  All I know is there was a stand down ordered at NORAD
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  and whether it's 7-7, the London bombings,
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  whether it's the Madrid bombings on 3-3-3 in 2003,
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  whether it is 9-11, whether it is this event,
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  whether it is the bombings in Afghanistan
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  where the president comes out and says,
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  yeah, your government is staging these terror attacks
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  and runs Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  Well, that all came out years ago.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  They took, here's the toll free number,
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[46:37.000 --> 46:45.000]  They took, they took 11 to 14 year olds
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  and made them dig ditches around Kabul
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  and the other two or three big cities in Afghanistan
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  and then they, under Al Qaeda orders, put them out there
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  and then the US going in there with NATO
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  did not attack any of the bases, any of the cities.
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  And if you go back to the time that was in the news,
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  why aren't they targeting the leadership?
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  They went and put innocent conscripts in there
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  for a simulated attack
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  because Al Qaeda and Taliban worked for the US on record.
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  This all came out, it's called the airlift of evil
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  and they killed tens of thousands of children
[47:18.000 --> 47:24.000]  that they gave AK-47s to fight Puff the Magic Dragon C-130s
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  and drones and the rest of it
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  and they blew them all up as a simulation.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  They were just part of a simulation.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  They were real, dying.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  Then US troops go in, they're not part of the cover story,
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  they're just told what to do
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  and Taliban and Al Qaeda turned themselves in,
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  they're loaded on C-130s given chest of gold and weapons
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  and US colonels, one colonel in special forces went public,
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  the San Francisco Chronicle,
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  said we were ordered to fly 30 to 40,000 of them over the mountains
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  into Pakistan and give them weapons and gold.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  They showed up, I give up.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  Now give me gold.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  Give me gold now and rocket launcher.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  You want us to take out Pakistan so you have excuse to,
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  I'm giving a Russian accent, whatever.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  We'll do it for you.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  And we grow opium, yes.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  See, a faction of the Taliban was real and had cut opium production
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  from 90% of world production in 2000 or 1999 to about 2001,
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  it was 9% of world opium production.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  Within a couple of years, back to 93% of world opium production.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  800-259-9231.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  And let's launch the phone system for me, guys.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  Thank you.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  Now, that's a daily drill.
[48:44.000 --> 48:54.000]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  I see the same story like Groundhog Day,
[48:58.000 --> 49:05.000]  day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year,
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  and then it comes out, they've got aliases,
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  it comes out they're being protected,
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  it comes out they're bragging to people that they're hot shots,
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  they're driving around with their buddies in cars,
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  that says, toorista on the license plate.
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  I mean, this is rock star party time.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  And their dad comes out and says they were being handled for five years
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  by intelligence groups.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  And I said Monday, before all this happened,
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  I said if somebody asks you to be part of a drill,
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  invites you out to be part of a drill,
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  it doesn't matter if the drill is even announced,
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  they may blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  Do not take a bag, do not be part of a drill.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  That's what happened on 7-7.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  That's what happened on the first World Trade Center attack in 1993.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  It came out in the New York Times that the FBI cooked the bomb,
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  trained the driver, shut up the guys, gave them the detonator,
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  and some evidence shows they thought they were part of the drill.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  We know the guy the FBI hired to cook the bomb was told it was a drill,
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  and he goes, well, I thought it was supposed to be a dummy bomb.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  No, it's a real bomb.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  Here's the materials.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  Now here's the real detonator.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  Okay, now tomorrow's the bombing, bust them.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  No, we're going to pull you off the case now.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  You're going to let the bombing go forward?
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  We're going to let them park it and then stop them.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  And the CIA asset went, Ahmad Salam said,
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  I think you're trying to set me up.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  I don't want to be part of this evil.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  And they said, just do what you're told.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  Do what you're told.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  The transcripts came out in court.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Much of it got declared national security.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Do what you're told.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And you can imagine them telling the patsies,
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  do what you're told, drop off these bags.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  You want more money for your girlfriends, don't you?
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  Mr. Hot Shot, Mr. Movie Star with your cool sunglasses?
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  And then once their cover got blown, the mission was kill them.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  Kill them.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Execute them.
[51:06.000 --> 51:35.000]  Get rid of them.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  Let them go.

[54:42.440 --> 54:49.600]  martial law rollout that is happening while all of that's going on what else is unfolding
[54:49.600 --> 54:56.400]  CISPA that openly censors and tracks the internet and gets rid of the fourth amendment for an
[54:56.400 --> 55:01.840]  electronic technotronic tyranny that's been rammed through the house ramming into the
[55:01.840 --> 55:08.800]  Senate unprecedented evil open border promotion total legalization amnesty you name it 800
[55:08.800 --> 55:16.560]  plus pages a bunch of other draconian garbage is going on while we're all distracted by
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.440]  this and again babies are being aborted everywhere including babies that can be adopted but all
[55:22.440 --> 55:28.160]  the media doesn't cry for them the media doesn't get sad for them it's only these three people
[55:28.160 --> 55:35.380]  that are dead which they use as psychological trauma to scare everyone into going along
[55:35.380 --> 55:39.200]  with this tyranny by the way we're almost sold out of the March issue of welcome to
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.840]  planet hoax you want to buy it in bulk it exposes stage terror the fraud that they don't
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.240]  want our guns are the fraud that they're not buying bullets and so much more if you want

[56:17.320 --> 56:26.160]  bill passes approves 24 million to expedite gun confiscation by the way that's not my
[56:26.160 --> 56:32.560]  headline that's the Huffington Post they're very excited about the gun confiscation but
[56:32.560 --> 56:38.440]  but nobody's coming for your guns so that's coming up also again the baby swimming and
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.680]  fighting for its life in the toilet as I tried to basically cram it down the toilet they
[56:43.680 --> 56:46.920]  got too lazy even shop the babies up and people are like you know we don't want to hear this
[56:46.920 --> 56:55.040]  it's so horrible well hearing it how about doing it and then people in the YouTube video
[56:55.040 --> 57:00.600]  I did about her like so what get out of a woman's life it's a nine-month-old baby there's
[57:00.600 --> 57:07.880]  more people that want to adopt than actually there are abortions every year it's it'd be
[57:07.880 --> 57:14.860]  better for the woman just to have the baby medically it increases women's chance of getting
[57:14.860 --> 57:24.040]  cancer and I just sit there and I watch how how callous the so-called left is they're
[57:24.040 --> 57:29.920]  not leftist they're authoritarians and they sit there and they make jokes about the dead
[57:29.920 --> 57:38.560]  baby and they sit there and you know see all the baby was exercising in the toilet I saw
[57:38.560 --> 57:45.720]  comments on info wars.com about get out of a woman's you know bedroom let the baby get
[57:45.720 --> 57:52.160]  exercise in the toilet you know I bet you wouldn't have the nerve to sit there and shop
[57:52.160 --> 57:59.240]  those babies up on that table like like hamburger or like barbecue I bet you wouldn't have the
[57:59.240 --> 58:02.320]  nerve to throw that baby in the toilet and watch it struggle for its life and drowned
[58:02.320 --> 58:09.720]  you're it's part of this disconnected decadence that's overtaken our country where the very
[58:09.720 --> 58:14.680]  same people say ban eating meat because it's bad to animals and and they call it cruel
[58:14.680 --> 58:20.120]  if someone butchers their own chicken they're so disconnected they I see PETA all the time
[58:20.120 --> 58:23.840]  you know saying arrest people that butcher their own chickens or whatever for animal
[58:23.840 --> 58:28.360]  cruelty see they think you're butchering a chicken because you're cruel not because you've
[58:28.360 --> 58:37.680]  been raised to do it yourself so they care about animals but not about humans then of
[58:37.680 --> 58:41.320]  course it's the environmentalists that have said kill babies up to age three for the earth
[58:41.320 --> 58:45.640]  oh but they want us to turn our guns in and ban black powder now because of what happened
[58:45.640 --> 58:59.440]  the Boston Marathon this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network you prepare by
[58:59.440 --> 59:04.480]  purchasing gold food and firearms but if you don't have a home security system and you're
[59:04.480 --> 59:08.960]  missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or

[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:19.320]  on the GCN radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:28.240]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:37.360]  Alex Jones one thing is certainly clear there is a massive cover-up going on surrounding
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.280]  the bombings of last Monday and another thing sure politically they're going to use this
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.920]  to try to ban black powder or restrict its purchase again somebody does something bad
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.840]  so we all lose our rights that's called authoritarianism we don't punish the individual you punish
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:58.600]  the group and one thing's also for sure they use this for a martial law takeover drill
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.600]  absolutely disgusting and they first said they were shooting rubber bullets into the
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.600]  boat but they were real bullets that's now admitted and so we're gonna be breaking all
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:15.440]  of this down toll-free number to join us 800-259-9231 too bad for the anti-gun people that tried
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.840]  to blame conservatives for this that was what they were going to go with report suspects
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:26.400]  not licensed to own guns so I guess in that area you gotta have a bunch of licenses to
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.520]  get them didn't stop them never stops anybody who's bad you could ban all the guns for citizens
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:37.520]  today anybody could walk up to a cop with ball peen hammer beat their brains out it's
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.760]  easy just bam ball peen hammer you're out hit them twice more in the temple they're
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:46.840]  dead take the weapon that's why they hate veterans the globalist hate veterans because
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.320]  veterans know how easy it is to kill and have the initiative they don't have the chicken
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:57.600]  neck you know ideas about it man I tell you being a domesticated servile country now is
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.560]  really painful but see there's a problem a bunch of us aren't servile a bunch of us aren't
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.040]  brainwashed and cattle a bunch of us know what's going on does it matter if you get
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.160]  51% to vote to take our guns or make us slaves again it isn't going to work Nick in Nevada
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.800]  you're on the air welcome yes Alex first of all I just want to say that it is a truly
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.800]  honor and a privilege to finally get through and to talk to you on air I've been waiting
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:26.280]  a long time to be able to get this opportunity and I just want to say thank you please don't
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:32.240]  thank me go go but what's the info well we are living in September 11, 2001 all over
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.120]  again we're seeing senators and president being sent letters placed with chemicals we're
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.600]  seeing suspicious packages left everywhere and all the the mind control and all the fear
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:48.560]  mongering that they put on to people is all for the purpose of having the full control
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.600]  over everybody and now we're seeing it on a larger scale with the takedown and the takeover
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.280]  of Boston and the complete you know martial law and it's going to spread throughout the
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.920]  entire country as they said they will have more stage events coming up and obviously
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.840]  they're going to you know they have gone this far was to say that they can't go any further
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.520]  and for anybody out there who thinks that the FBI does not set up these stage events
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.320]  is out of their minds as the proof and the evidence is everywhere and as they've come
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.320]  out and told us flat out you know to our faces and I remember also too a couple weeks ago
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.840]  you mentioned how you know more people need to stand up and more people need to bring
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.720]  awareness and talk about the new world order and to shed the light on to people and I just
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.720]  want to say that I started my own podcast as well and if you wouldn't mind I like to
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.880]  give that out onto your show and have more people open their eyes and that's distorted
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.360]  reality dot podbean dot com and I'm doing the very best that I can locally here in Las
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.680]  Vegas to spread out the word on the new world order on the chair listen I think it's good
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.800]  that you're doing that and I always let people plug their shows here because my goal is to
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:03.560]  do that but but if we all just plug on my show it only then it basically communicates
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:10.160]  within the choir it is important to go out and proselytize critical thinking historical
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.960]  research being aware of how things really work really it's not being a chump and being
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.520]  street smart people need to be street smart that's what this show is really about not
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:23.200]  being chumps understanding how the world really works you know getting informed about our

[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:29.840]  we have up at infowars.com prison planet.com and i'm also covering what's at drudgereport.com
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.800]  meanwhile worldnet daily reports americans are snapping by the millions i've been telling
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:43.640]  you this road raging fighting divorce is way up suicide is way up uh yeah you put 20 of
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.000]  the population on suicide pills serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other anti-psychotics
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.920]  and other antidepressants they cause you statistically to commit suicide mass murder but the answer
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:00.000]  is more people on drugs roughly 20 percent again of the u.s military it's come out as
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.960]  on these drugs while in combat oh that's a good idea saudi national question after boston
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:16.080]  bombing was on terror watch list that's right that's the big breaking news ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.560]  uh the saudi was on a terror watch list and reportedly had six members of his family in
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:31.600]  saudi arabia on the saudi arabian terror watch list and we broke that first here in the united
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:41.160]  states of america i broke that saturday on infowars.com and i broke it sunday with a
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:49.040]  video that i put up and now it is at townhall.com that is the big glenn beck news was that he
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.520]  was on a watch list and again that was in the foreign press friday i i didn't find it
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:01.720]  till till saturday homeland security was dragging its feet over tamperland's u.s citizenship
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:09.600]  application yeah i bet they were and now the keto institute the neo-con libertarian group
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.520]  is spinning the bombing saying it's the reason to legalize illegals because they didn't come
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:23.080]  across illegally but americans are committing suicide and society is falling apart because
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:28.780]  we are in a deep depression and people basically have television sickness because all the general
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:34.400]  public does is watch eight hours of tv a day young people it's even more the average adults
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.160]  like five and a half six hours but that's what they put on surveys some surveys show
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:46.040]  young people watch as much as 14 hours of tv and video games a day and so right now
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:49.880]  they're having the perception of terrorists everywhere so i'm going to tell you again
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.880]  we called there'd be a big public terrorist event in this country they try to blame on
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.280]  the tea party then they said they had someone arrested from the right wing they were going
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.840]  to roll them out uh the msnbc and cnn celebrated then the photos of all the other patsies and
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.720]  the drill freaked them out so they shifted to these other patsies i believe who i predicted
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.400]  would end up being u.s intelligence assets and now it turns out they had fake identification
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.420]  traveling in and out representative mike rogers camerlin may have traveled to russia under
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:24.000]  alias that's huffington post and now they're saying well yes he was able to get on with
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.680]  a fake name it must have been a mistake um yeah you try getting on a plane the underwear
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.360]  bomber was put on the plane by a u.s agent we broke that because we had uh kurt haskell
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:42.680]  on first and he said yeah no i saw a sharp-dressed man get him on the plane without a passport
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.800]  and later it came out in congress a u.s intelligence agencies ordered the state department to get
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:58.200]  them on the plane and the state department had so much power that the the european airport
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.020]  in amsterdam the dutch airport took the orders and put him on then a firecracker went off
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:07.360]  in his pants so in land of the free home of the brave oh my gosh the scanners ordered
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.440]  a year before that were going in the next week they said we just are going to put these
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.880]  scanners in because of this which they already have been ordered for a year the whole thing
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:22.600]  is scripted the whole thing is rolled out and now they said on on wednesday and thursday
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.880]  on thursday here's their photos we don't know who they are here's the video we don't know
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.160]  who they are and it turns out five years ago they knew who they were and it turns out they
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:37.920]  were following them and it turns out they'd met with them two and a half years ago and
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.720]  it turns out that the family said they were absolutely hooked in with the fbi well yeah
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.600]  the fbi was just running a local investigation to cover up for their intelligence connection
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:55.320]  just like 77 was run by a swat the mi6 officer and they set the patsies up and said it was
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.280]  a drill what did i tell you monday before the bombs went off i said if anybody wants
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:09.580]  you to be part of a drill carrying a simulated explosive don't be part of it i had family
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:16.120]  in counterterrorism and and and of course this was a big public event at camp maybury and
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:23.200]  i was invited a few years ago to go see them practice taking out terrorists in a simulated
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.800]  bombing and i said are you kidding and they're like come on don't be paranoid it's been announced
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:37.880]  it's public i'm not no no no no no no no no i'm not getting anywhere near one of these
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.360]  drills and this is where the general public with a guy with a beard acting like he had
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.280]  a bomb and the helicopters come in and stop him and all this stupid stuff you know oh
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:51.040]  yes keeping us safe our government just like mohammed cars i said runs taliban and al-qaeda
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.160]  and they run them in libya and syria and they just gave them 123 million dollars last friday
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.200]  to al-qaeda in syria to offensively attack that government and those people and make
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.980]  fathers suicide bomb or they kill their whole family and there are videos of men women and
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:13.560]  children being thrown off roofs and having their heads chopped off god bless ran paul
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:26.160]  right now you know he's been speaking out against the drones and everything else
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.520]  and ran paul is now urging reid mcconnell to stall immigration reform after boston which
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:38.800]  is amnesty so ran paul's taking action by the way we get ran paul back on i want you
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.920]  guys go after ran paul just last time he last time they just called us and said we want
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.600]  to have him on i want to get him on about all this and i want ron paul so please fire
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:57.120]  political torpedoes of love and uh get them uh get them uh both on the show a pretty silly
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:04.520]  joke i just told didn't it all right anyways um man i tell you this is just so ridiculous
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.400]  we got wayne madsen our award-winning journalist and formerly the national security agency
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.200]  uh joining us to give us his take at the bottom of the hour then joel scousin of world affairs
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.840]  brief who day one said has all the signs of false flag he's going to be on everyone i
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:30.000]  respect like joel scousin and uh people like uh i mean there's so many uh folks out there
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.460]  saying it has all the signs of false flag but steve pacinik uh you name it or saying
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:39.460]  this thing stinks to high heaven and uh again why is it always people being intelligence
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:45.500]  handled lee harvey oswald tim mcveigh it's the same formula have people that are part
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.760]  of your operation even if they get caught you just say they're double agents and that's
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.400]  what the israelis are saying oh you know these guys were sent over under fake ids by the
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.560]  way they said this before it was in the news and there obviously were to infiltrate muslim
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:05.000]  extremist groups uh in the caucuses a caucus mountain region but the israelis didn't point
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.920]  out the west is funding the leader of that group the uh chechnya bin laden as he's known
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.640]  a billion bucks or more has been sent to these guys uh same old story like they created al-qaeda
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:26.760]  to fight the russians and so so a group created by our government as usual is radicalized
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.800]  and somehow brainwashed and now they're saying there's a group of 12 guys in a sleeper cell
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.940]  that they're hunting for who help these guys but the rest of the media is like no no no
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:45.880]  it's a lone guy because the 12 guys are the handlers and again they follow an exact paradigm
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.480]  an exact program an exact operation people say alex couldn't there be some real terror
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:58.600]  absolutely absolutely uh easter bunnies may exist i've never seen one i don't think they
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:12.640]  exist but i cannot definitively prove that there are not easter bunnies living in america
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:19.480]  i cannot prove that leprechauns aren't real i cannot prove that santa claus is not real
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:23.640]  uh now now look are there in some cases in israel real people that blow stuff up are
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:30.560]  real people that actually go on a bus and stab folks yes but nine times out of ten the
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:37.600]  israeli intelligence services haraats jerusalem posts have all reported create fake al-qaeda
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:43.180]  to then bomb themselves when they don't want to have a peace process or something type
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:49.640]  in israel created fake al-qaeda you'll get mainstream news type in israel created hamash
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:57.960]  in 1973 now again i'm not saying that's how you control the opposition is you don't like
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:07.600]  hezbollah iranian run a real terror group that's really attacking you you create hezbollah that
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.920]  then fights for political control and acts like terrorists to then take up all the resistance
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.520]  that iran is picking up on to then mop up everybody and then spy on your resistance
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.760]  and then if you politically need to get elected or something just blow something up and blame
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:29.600]  on your political enemy there it is israel faked al-qaeda presence that's a bbc and that's
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.700]  a whitewash itself here here here let me just show new viewers and radio listeners radio
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:41.000]  listeners can just search whatever i say whatever i say and then you can find it for yourself
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.480]  just type in mi6 agent seven seven bombings and you'll get fox news democratic underground
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:20:00.840]  infowars.com bbc daily mail where the head of the bombings is and was mi6 and is protected
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.400]  and what did he do he set up six guys with backpacks who thought they were part of a
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.560]  drill and blew them sky high in the last two years alone the us has seen huge losses to

[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:26.000]  hello yep hey alex thanks for the uh taking the phone call um you're right uh i was kind
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.320]  of surprised um you know i don't listen to you all the time uh but when i see something
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.000]  and and to be honest with you i really didn't watch the news that much either because i
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.040]  know it's just a bunch of propaganda but i did hear them talk about shooting the rubber
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:50.440]  bullets and when this guy was in the boat and what kills me about this is for an average
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.420]  rational thinking person to sit and listen to that where you have somebody in a boat
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:00.640]  if anybody owns a boat especially the size of that boat what are rubber bullets going
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.440]  to do and and where are they getting the angle to hit this guy no no they were saying it
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:11.120]  and i heard it over the scanner to to confuse the media and this was hours after hour and
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.480]  45 minutes after they'd already shot him up and they watched him crawl around they watch
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.680]  his heat you know resonance there then they say get out and but see their problem was
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:24.720]  the media ended up with telephoto lenses getting a shot and you can hear the cops going oh
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.560]  no the media's got a shot because again they had a mission to kill him that's why they
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.740]  said stay in your house don't come out because they had why do you what do you think's going

[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:01.620]  to wayne madsen of wayne madsen report here in just a moment as the news comes out it
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:07.040]  turns out the fbi had been all over these two youth for five years had sent them into
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:14.240]  the caucuses it appears through the cia to infiltrate groups and that's the picture that
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:21.440]  is now emerging and that the fbi called them before and after the bombing the mother is
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.920]  now saying and when you've got parents immediately saying they were set up by security services
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:32.680]  the government was all over my kids they either let them do this or they're handling them
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.680]  and they thought they were part of a drill and either or or didn't plant bombs and then
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:43.560]  you've got the government in damage control with a bunch of saudi arabians you've got
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:48.400]  all of this going on and so we're gonna be getting a wayne madsen's take on that right
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.620]  now but this fits the exact same cut out we've seen over and over again before we go any
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:59.480]  further don't forget that you can see info wars nightly news every night at seven o'clock

[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:11.800]  that you're listening to right now by subscribing to prison planet dot tv and why do we call
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:17.480]  it prison planet because by using these events they are training us that when the government
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.680]  says everyone stay in your house you have to or when the government says they're going
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:28.400]  to put checkpoints on the highway you have to the great threat is tyranny not statistically
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.680]  terrorism whether it's real or not and again 200 plus people die a year from honeybee stings
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.840]  according to world almanac less than 50 die a year from terrorism but they high put up
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.640]  like it's the end of the world same thing with mass shootings less than 100 people die
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.440]  a year from mass shootings more than half of those are gang related less than 40 people
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:55.680]  that are actually in mass shootings that are innocents and not groups killing each other
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.240]  and they try to use that to then guilt all of us and make all of us suspects and that's
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:07.760]  what this is getting us to cheer our own servitude so now more than ever it is essential to support

[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.360]  claims fbi called eldest sons after bombing before fatal shootout now remember the whole
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:21.520]  family everything the family said the family said thursday early thursday morning hours
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.180]  i guess it was already friday morning they said that you know this my son is set up these
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:32.080]  are not arch you know you know they didn't do this they've been harassed for five years
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:40.440]  by the fbi this is intelligence services setting them up and then it comes out for five years
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.920]  they've been doing this and two and a half years ago they met with them again when the
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.820]  russians wanted it on record that hey we know these guys work for you so the fbi had to
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:54.480]  act like they were doing something and now here's the big issue we have the fbi when
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.000]  they knew full well who they were and if we confirm they were talking to them on the phone
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.720]  we've got them in the middle of the drills and all the other suspects we're getting wayne
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.880]  madsen's expert take on this in about one minute they were on the news saying we don't
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:15.080]  know who they are help us learn who they are when they knew full well who they were it's
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.620]  been confirmed they knew who they were and they had a press conference and said thursday
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:26.260]  night here they are this is the only person you look at and they're now in the washington
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:31.420]  post and a bunch of other publications saying the alternative media almost screwed up our
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:36.660]  investigation they shouldn't have access to photos and videos from surveillance cameras
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:41.240]  or the public's info in the future great you're going to put cameras up everywhere and still
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.500]  blow stuff up and blame patsies and then say we shouldn't have access to it because we're
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:52.340]  bad it was citizens that found your patsy after your lockdown was lifted you couldn't
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:57.760]  find him to killing and just like you did the brother and so you lifted it going okay
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.560]  let the slaves find it but then the media could then move the media you'd threatened
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.980]  to kill so they got a bird's eye view so you couldn't finish the killing now you're drugging
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:11.960]  him up out of his mind to confess he did it just like the so-called aurora shooter now
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.860]  wayne madsen has worked at the national security agency before that he was in uh submarine
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:22.820]  warfare and if you watch c-span you always see him there in national security meetings
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:27.780]  in the press gallery and he works at the there in dc there's a lot of intel at the national
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:34.760]  press club i have found wayne madsen's intel to be so devastatingly accurate that i just
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.840]  don't think we we we we blow trumpets when he comes on he deserves a drum roll he travels
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:47.920]  all over the place to cover these events uh he he has impeccable sources in a climate
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:52.060]  where they're arresting whistleblowers and media people left and right and he has a lot
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:56.500]  of courage and wayne madsen report.com is his website wayne i don't know your take on
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:02.620]  this yet uh i so all of us will now get your take on it here today but am i wrong in saying
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:09.860]  there's a cover-up a and this has the classic signs of another uh provocateur patsy event
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:15.980]  wayne madsen oh you're absolutely right it actually gets deeper than uh just what's happened
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:25.220]  over the last uh week or so you go back to 1994 when um the russians and chechens fought
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:32.420]  this uh very big uh civil war very deadly civil war the u.s began recruiting chechens
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:39.340]  with the idea that we would uh support chechnya's independence from russia and uh things didn't
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:45.700]  go too well because many of these chechens eventually uh were wahabi eyes by the saudis
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:53.660]  and became uh these uh jihadis and and and eventually they wound up fighting us in afghanistan
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:58.700]  and iraq and they're fighting in syria right now on behalf of the rebels who of course
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.620]  were uh supporting and and historically this is the one most warlike areas of the world
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:08.380]  these people all are tough as nails yeah uh well when things got bad after some deadly
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:15.940]  uh terrorist attacks by chechen uh terrorists in russia a movie theater in moscow a high
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:23.820]  speed train between moscow and saint petersburg uh moscow airport and several others metro
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:30.100]  stations in moscow the russians really cracked down so uh what we started to see is the cia
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:35.260]  started bringing over a whole bunch of uh refuge political aside many of these people
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:42.820]  i call them a professional uh refugees including the sarnia family the sarnia family uh the
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:50.380]  the young boy first came over here in 002 uh apparently got his uh residency as asylum
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:55.360]  by the way i'll just say it off a gut feeling the dad looks like a classic intelligence
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.700]  operative he just screams james bond type what do you say well yeah and i'll get to
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:06.580]  uncle ruslan later when it comes to that but uh he uh the uh johar got this uh asylum in
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:12.980]  arlington virginia well we know what is headquartered in arlington virginia every defense and intelligence
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:17.340]  agency you can imagine that was an o-1 then the older brother comes over but what i've
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:24.980]  discovered is that boston and the washington dc area are the two centers for chechen refugees
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:29.620]  many of whom who got political asylum in the united states in the case of boston that's
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:35.980]  a very tight-knit group uh one of their ex or their kind of unofficial leaders is a former
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:42.540]  quote unquote foreign minister of independent chechnya uh elias akhmadov now when he first
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:48.340]  applied for citizenship uh the department of homeland security and the justice department
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:53.960]  said no we have we have information that links into terrorist attacks in russia so we're
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.420]  not going to give asylum to a terrorist well who weighs in now you've heard over the last
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:05.540]  couple of days who's been arguing that this kid johar should be tried in a military commission
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:11.180]  he should have his citizenship taken away which was granted last year on september 11th
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:17.340]  uh who's been arguing this but john mccain john mccain and his good friend there lindsey
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:22.460]  uh miss lindsey from south carolina yeah miss miss uh miss lindsey because they don't want
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:27.900]  this info getting out exactly so how do you suppress evidence you do it through a military
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:33.340]  commission you get these guys uh waylaid to get mo and then and then you know nobody's
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:37.380]  going to hear all the details well what about the fact that the mother says and it looks
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:42.400]  like that it is the older son tamarind on the video and then now the witnesses are saying
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:46.300]  they ran him over with a car and then shot him up full of holes and then they tried to
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:51.180]  kill the other one they want these guys dead well when i saw him laying on a slab in the
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:57.340]  morgue i could only think of uh uh kusay and uday hussein you know saddam hussein's sons
[01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:02.940]  who we laid out on a slab slab and we broadcast those photos gruesome photos around the world
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:08.740]  but john mccain was one of the people who argued for uh giving political asylum to uh
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:13.020]  ilius aqua dob this guy who had been who the justice department homeland security said
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:19.540]  no they eventually overruled it uh he had a high high-priced lawyer in new york arguing
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:25.040]  just like the cia ordered the jeddah saudi arabian embassy to let the uh 15 hijackers
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:30.480]  back in even though they were flagged as terrorists they told them these guys are really cia exactly
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:36.660]  so so we have all these chechens coalescing around boston and washington and and who who
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:44.080]  takes on the chechen cause well every neo-con who you can think of uh people like james
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:52.080]  woolsey the former cia director madeline albright uh a good old mccain uh they even got tate
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:58.560]  kennedy because the law firm who represented this guy aqua dob uh sergeant shriver kennedy's
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.600]  brother-in-law was um a partner a senior partner now i understand you're giving us all the
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.020]  connections bottom line what do you think really happened here because they were getting
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:10.660]  ready to blame it on the tea party they said we have somebody arrested they were going
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:16.020]  to be at the at the courthouse then they shut that down they acted very panicked don't look
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:21.180]  at these other photos the fbi said that's word for word only look at these now the mother
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:27.100]  says they were calling them before and after the bombing and then right before the fatal
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:34.360]  shootout uh what is your inside intel on capitol hill they needed another dramatic uh not as
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:40.280]  big as 9 11 but they needed something to spur on the passage of this cispa act i call this
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:45.520]  the patriot act for the internet this is going to give the law enforcement intelligence carte
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:51.600]  launch access to everybody's interaction with anything electronic and to plant stuff on
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.520]  you more important to plant stuff on you yeah and then we had the ricin attack instead of
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:01.920]  anthrax that was the same playbook stuff sent to congress to the white house so it's a cia
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.200]  playbook or uh who would you say is involved i you know i i don't i can't even say it's
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:11.000]  a cia's playbook anymore i think it's the it's the same people if you look at the people
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.320]  that back these chechen refugees in boston and dc it's his project for the new american
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:22.720]  century crowd it's a neo-con operation neo-con operation they never went away uh as a matter
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.520]  of fact they're still in the obama administration they were consulted by the obama yeah i was
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:33.640]  looking one company uh is set to get 10 billion dollars off this cispa thing spying on us
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:38.000]  we're talking about a hundred billion over the next five years spying on us so they're
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.880]  also going to charge us to read our mail oh absolutely and then you got all these other
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:48.240]  little things that play like charging people who enter the united states on over land borders
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:54.040]  a fee as they do with airports right now and seaports uh so you know there's a lot of people
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:59.080]  who have their hands out they're looking at making some money here contractors dhs what
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:04.160]  about the operation itself i mean clearly i believe the operation idea so you have these
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:10.200]  like uh security private security contractors there this craft international uh that was
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:17.440]  headed up by this guy kyle who who was shot back in on on groundhog day february 2nd by
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.640]  his colleague uh they said suffered from pts and by the way now they're trying to claim
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.460]  those are national guard there were some national guard dressed the same but there are people
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:30.000]  wearing craft hats there as well you can tell the difference between that national guard
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.920]  were wearing the camouflage uh uniforms and the and the craft guys were wearing these
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:40.440]  khaki pants and these vests when they just used as well as the smoke screen so there's
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.920]  so many black backpacks cops would never be able to stop the real guys well either they
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:50.880]  either the backpacks were uh diversionary or one of their backpacks contained some of
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:56.980]  the explosive devices uh you know it's hard to say but we do know that there was a bomb
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:01.160]  drill going and once again here's a drill taking place there's always a it's always
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:05.740]  a drill why do they run the exact same playbook over and over again because it works it works
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:09.600]  it works and they already know the media the corporate media is in their pocket and they're
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.120]  not going to ask any questions well a few british papers are you know and i guess in
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:20.400]  russia some media in russia's uh taking a close look at that not accepting everything
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.580]  that's coming out from the the corporate wires and over the corporate networks but but they
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:30.320]  know they can get away with it they've gotten away with it so many times in the past oh
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:34.960]  you know why why why uh fix something if it ain't broke you know that's the way they're
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.220]  looking at it so they're going to use the same thing they'll change it they have to
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:44.100]  change it you know anthrax to ricin you know that no more build uh buildings being taken
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:51.720]  down by uh controlled demolitions uh and blaming it on airplanes sure let me ask you this do
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:56.360]  you think it's accurate to say that this thing unraveled spectacularly and they're now you
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:01.060]  know what is it the fbi doesn't want us to look at in all the other photos and videos
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:05.660]  that they're so scared of well i i think what they don't want anybody to know is that as
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:11.100]  you as being reported you just mentioned that the fbi had contacts with at least the older
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:16.880]  guy uh tamarlin uh sarnia and the other thing we got to look at uncle ruslan when i first
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:21.980]  saw the the news crews out of washington up in montgomery village maryland we know that
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:28.140]  the sarnia's father over in dogistan apparently was an auto mechanic when he lived in massachusetts
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:31.480]  well you know he obviously didn't make a lot of money but you look at that guy's house
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:37.300]  uncle ruslan in montgomery village i i know that area that area you they're expensive
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:41.700]  homes there's six hundred thousand dollar homes up there the uncle the dad all of them
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:46.420]  come off like extremely smooth operators like if i saw one of those guys walking down the
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:50.300]  street i've learned how to recognize them i'd go that's a real intelligence operative
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:55.380]  not one of the fake ones and and let me tell you the dad immediately said it's intelligence
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:00.620]  services and looks mad and says my sons have been set up and he comes off very authoritative
[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:06.060]  and they were saying this instantly because i guarantee you being connected to the chechens
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:09.820]  and the state department bringing them over here these people the whole family's probably
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:14.540]  operatives well they also said that the family may have lived in kazakhstan for a while now
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:19.380]  uncle ruslan it turns out he's a graduate of duke law school he's a lawyer he's worked
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.740]  for arthur anderson and he also now works he works in the big oil business he works
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:29.660]  for big oil and for kazakhstan a big producer and exporter of oil and and the companies
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:35.640]  with now is big sky uh big sky energy and they're a holding company oddly enough big
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:41.940]  sky corporation is out of calgary in canada but the holding company is located where little
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:48.460]  rock arkansas now that it rang a bell with me because i wait a minute who who what former
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:53.660]  president is in tight with the kazakhstan government and has been accused of help covering
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:58.820]  up all the you know illegal bribes being paid to uh... by western companies to the dictator
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:04.620]  over there mister nazar bayev but but bill clinton and here we have this big energy company
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:10.320]  that does all its business in kazakhstan relocated its headquarters to little rock of all places
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.960]  where the clinton foundation is located the clinton foundation has been getting big donations
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:23.940]  from where kazakhstan you know exactly so they're helping out yeah why does the fbi
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:28.780]  not want to go they don't want to look at any further cuz you know what the fbi is law
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:32.660]  enforcement for the wealthy in this country that's right there there i don't even think
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:36.900]  the fbi is involved in the attack so much as and because this looks more like an intelligence
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:40.700]  off the fbi will just get patsy's and then bust them before they do it usually unless
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:44.220]  it's the first world trade center attack with these intelligence agencies though they'll
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:50.420]  have the multiple groups there as as fallbacks now what about the saudi arabian connection
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.540]  because it has been confirmed the white house is involved in a cover-up it turns out this
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:59.880]  guy's got a bunch of family on terror watch list or is this just a rabbit trail it could
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:04.380]  be but look we have to look at the saudis because they have been very active in chechnya
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:11.340]  and radicalizing the chechen muslim population and so if if anyone may have been involved
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:16.180]  in radicalizing old tamarind there it may have been the saudi groups so we can't let
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:23.220]  them off the hook but we we also the the other thing i i want to point out here is is that
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:31.100]  this whole uh a chechen operation may be an attempt also to embarrass vladimir putin
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:37.220]  because we know that the russians asked us for information on tamarind and and the fbi
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:42.140]  said well we asked them why give us more information well putin is not dumb enough well they said
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:45.860]  we think you may be connected to these events but but i want you to finish your point but
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:51.900]  isn't that how the russians tend to blow somebody's cover is open a public file on them right
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:56.020]  and the russians aren't dumb enough to you know when when the fbi said well give us more
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:59.860]  information give us more information they're not going to give away their sources either
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:05.180]  because if we get their sources the fbi of course is going to pursue them well i looked
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:10.300]  it up you've got a billion dollars in the last 15 years or so going into those stands
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:14.740]  to to actually bring the wahabi astin and train them uh i mean i mean the problem is
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:19.240]  saudi arabia and the globalist and now look at how the u.s is using saudi arabia to put
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:23.300]  al-qaeda and libya and syria and i predict they're going to shoot down jet airliners
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:27.300]  with heat-seeking missiles and then and then take our rights when our government gave it
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:33.340]  to them and then we had the national security foreign affairs advisor to netanyahu on stating
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:38.440]  it's according to herar it's israeli newspapers that he said this boston marathon bombing
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:42.940]  is good for israel well that's just like what netanyahu said after 9 11 he said it on fox
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:48.180]  news this is very good for it you know everybody everybody's winning out with these terrorist
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:53.500]  attacks against the united states except the american people we are being played for chumps
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:55:01.340]  everybody's making a killing from from saudi arabia to israel to to these mujahideen rebels
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:06.500]  that are fighting in syria and fought qaddafi the only people are getting messed over here
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:11.480]  is us because we're the ones sure we're the people that getting the legs blown off and
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.400]  having our kids killed in in boston and everywhere record suicide of the troops that nobody wants
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:22.220]  to humanize or personalize uh what do you make what do you make of aqmed uh you know
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:26.060]  dennis eating the things he's up to how does how does hezbollah tie into this because we
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:30.420]  know that's a real group actually run by iran what do you expect them to do will the media
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:36.340]  try to blame them somehow yeah i'll try uh yeah but look i'm a dean of joc condemned
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:41.380]  this i did the uh the ayatollah haman a he they condemned this and he said while we condemn
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:45.020]  this act of violence you know hey how about looking at some of the other acts of violence
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:48.460]  the united states is involved in sponsoring around the world sure so let's shift gears
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:53.980]  now to the president of um afghanistan mohammed karzai that's a big deal that he came out
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:58.100]  and said the west runs al-qaeda and taliban and is staging bombings as a pretext for a
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:03.580]  police state uh what does that signify i wondered he wake up and start smelling the afghan coffee
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:09.260]  you know i mean he he of all people should know about the our links with the uh al-qaeda
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:14.100]  and the taliban because he when he was in exile he was sitting there in pakistan and
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:18.060]  here in this country and witnessing those connections so you know i'm glad he's come
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:24.460]  out and said it um but uh you know let's see how long he remains in power my feeling is
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:31.020]  that karzai is you know some people's patience is wearing thin with this guy and you know
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:35.420]  we do know that when the soviets controlled afghanistan you know a lot of afghan leaders
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:40.100]  would wind up with bullets in their head and you know being strung up uh in the central
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:46.740]  square of kabul uh let's see how long it takes for uh our our guys to get around to you know
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:53.900]  taking care of mr karzai just like i did pat tillman yeah exactly let me ask you this look
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:59.420]  how long can can the globalists openly run al-qaeda while i mean publicly running al-qaeda
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:03.580]  like the war on drugs publicly they run the drugs and that's public congressional hearings
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:10.220]  studies ci solicitor general in 96 how long can they do this where they run the terrorists
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:15.900]  publicly and then take our liberties using the terrorists to threaten us that they run
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:20.300]  i mean how long can this go on isn't it beginning to wear thin and people know about it well
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:25.380]  look we gotta have people back in congress like we had back in the in the 70s that had
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:30.260]  the gumption to stand up and ask these questions uh you know we had the senator frank church
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:36.200]  that went after the cia we had congresswoman bella abzug and congressman notice pike from
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.340]  new york both of them were from new york we had people in congress that asked the tough
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:47.100]  questions and look even even in the case of let me check ins into the country back back
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:53.380]  when uh there was uh this opposition uh to let this aqueduct and these captions in two
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:58.640]  members of the congress of the house voiced their objections they got overruled one was
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.140]  jim sense and brenner who was the chairman of the house judiciary committee and one of
[01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:09.660]  his subcommittee chairs john hostetter from indiana now i i think we should revisit both
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:15.260]  sense and brenner and hostetter and say what what possessed you to say no to giving these
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:21.060]  chechen's asylum and who why did you say we shouldn't why were you supporting initially
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:26.540]  the justice department's refusal to let them in uh and i i think uh i think sense and brenner
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:31.380]  is still around i don't think the other guy is hostetter but they must have had information
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:36.380]  that led them to believe both of them republicans by the way and and this was the this was the
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:40.740]  bush administration they were you know they were fighting stay there do five more minutes

[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:30.740]  jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones well we haven't
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:37.020]  really talked about what they're ramming through while the public is smoke-screened with this
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:42.700]  bombing we're going to do that in the next segment and then i promise i'll get to julio
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:48.540]  and dc and dave and bradley and terry and everybody else that is patiently holding going
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:51.660]  back to wayne madsen i've been throwing a lot of points here as we cover all the bases
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:56.540]  and all the angles uh here's the big elephant in the room they said they didn't know them
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:01:00.700]  put their photos out and now it turns out they've been all around them for five years
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:07.140]  the family saying it's intelligence agency setting them up the family again looks pretty
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:12.220]  well informed to say the least looking at these people and their body language and the
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:17.820]  things they say they're smooth operators and you know is there any probability that they
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:21.820]  could be double triple agents like the israelis are saying that turned against the west and
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:26.660]  did a real bombing yeah maybe one in what a hundred one and two hundred or or do you
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:30.620]  disagree with that but what about the fact that we know they knew them for five years
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:34.460]  not just two and a half and the mother says they were calling him right after the bombing
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:38.740]  and right before the shootout and they're acting like there's a cover-up don't we have
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:43.460]  them when the fbi is saying here are these photos who is this when it was well known
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:48.860]  to the fbi doesn't that prove right there uh and and they were patsies why didn't they
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:53.540]  go after him day one i think they were fallback patsies they were going to blame the tea party
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:59.900]  on this wayne madsen well i'll tell you i you know what i i i i i'm reminded of uh muhammad
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:05.100]  ata you know he was seen at maxwell air force base where they knew him as lieutenant colonel
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:10.740]  ata the egyptian air force he was involved in being a drug mule as well he was involved
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:17.220]  with unsavory people he was on jack abramoff's casino boats a couple days before 9 11 and
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:24.180]  he was clearly working for our intelligence operations so i you know hey uh tamarlin sarnia
[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:30.420]  meet muhammad ata it's just another one of these i think you're right he's sarnia the
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:35.980]  older one was it was a patsy you know i'm beginning to think the the younger one johar
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:40.420]  was just you know tagging along with big brother and you know he had other really had other
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:45.940]  interests but you know he had bb guns with him i mean it was yeah you know i mean this
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:50.280]  guy this this kid was just tagging along with big brother we obviously must have looked
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:54.140]  up to yeah they wanted the big brother dead that's who they ran over and and and shot
[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:59.220]  the street and lied about yeah yeah but the fact that the fbi we know from the russian
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:04.220]  government that we at least know that they were contacted uh fbi was contacted by the
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:10.460]  russian government about this guy and they uh you know they just left it off now why did not
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:16.780]  president obama call bob muller the head the fbi director into the oval office and said you guys
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:21.660]  screwed up here i want i want your letter of resignation on my desk by this afternoon because
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:27.660]  obama holds no one accountable he's never held one person in his administration accountable
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:34.380]  that's a real flaw in his leadership i agree bottom line bengazi uh giving the al-qaeda 10,000
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:39.020]  heat-seeking missiles what's the point of that what's at the bottom of bengazi oh well here we
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:44.940]  go again the u.s being found to support the mujahideen we had you know there were chechens
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:50.940]  fighting in libya as well and and now some of the libyans are all fighting in syria we're keeping
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:58.300]  this conflict this it's called the um strategy of tension strategy attention clash of civilizations
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:03.660]  these are all neo-con terms we got to keep that going because there's no more you know communist
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:09.100]  block now there's this terrorist axis of evil nonsense and they got to keep it alive and i think
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:14.860]  why they pulled off the marathon bombing is look they started letting people go on airplanes now
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:19.740]  with some you know pocket knives yeah they did this to sell 100 billion dollars in robots and
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:24.620]  robots and armored vehicles and yeah and and train that was marshall law in boston they're
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:29.340]  training us to accept that oh oh by the way uh the front page of the lebanese english language
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:35.340]  newspaper the daily start i i'm going to try to get this photo out but there's the other day they
[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:39.100]  ran a photo when they were going door to door and pulling people out of their homes in watertown
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:45.100]  massachusetts there is a picture of a police officer with a gun drawn on a lady who has her

[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:11.500]  then your phone calls then joel scousen introducing pro one all of your filtration
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:17.420]  in one system portable on the go no more do you have two or three filters to just reduce
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:22.780]  sodium fluoride you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95 percent of
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:28.380]  hydrofluorosolic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:34.220]  ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:39.740]  in one filter element it is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:46.780]  10 off with promo code water this is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove

[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:37.660]  okay shifting gears here uh with a quick update and report on what's being rammed through with
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:42.460]  our reporter david knight while we're watching the martial law takeover conditioning well what
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:47.500]  we're looking at is a threat of imposing the patriot act on the internet now the house passed
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:52.780]  last thursday uh the cispa act which has been around before and it was killed once before along
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:58.220]  with pipa and sopa and the cyber security act of 2012 all those things have been brought up all
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:01.900]  those things were defeated but then as it was going through last thursday it's pretty amazing
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:06.380]  what happened in the house there were a lot of amendments put in to try to protect privacy they
[02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:10.300]  weren't even allowed to be debated you had one amendment that said that they had to get a search
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:15.260]  warrant before they looked at people's uh private papers and their internet communications which of
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:20.220]  course would comply with the fourth amendment that of course was not allowed to to come in but we
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:25.020]  also had the chair of the house committee on homeland security mike mccall said in the case
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:31.100]  of boston they were real bombs but he said we need to arm ourselves against digital bombs that
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:35.900]  are on their way and so uh that that's what they did to try to ram this through because the other
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:42.220]  bills were most of them were set up around uh copyright issues but now when they say security
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:46.860]  the republicans are just falling in line left and right we it has not passed the senate yet
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:51.100]  and obama says he's not going to sign it but of course he said that about the ndaa so he can't
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:55.900]  trust that but it's been defeated in the past and they're also saying because of wikileaks they
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:01.500]  want it wikileaks was a good thing exposing their criminal activity right so they're saying hey we
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:05.980]  want to keep covering up our criminal ops you can't talk about these efforts to try to keep
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:10.060]  the internet free without talking about aaron schwartz aaron schwartz died in the middle of
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:16.460]  january he was just 26 he was under indictment uh by this same u.s attorney that's going to be
[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:21.420]  trying these bombers in boston and she threw the book at him local prosecutors are just going to
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:26.460]  let him go as a misdemeanor charge she put 13 felony charges on him and had him looking at a
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:30.780]  35-year sentence she got a lot of criticism because a lot of people said that she drove
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:35.660]  him to suicide but we're not so i'm not so sure that he was that he committed suicide yeah folks
[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:41.660]  when you hang yourself in a jail cell uh there's a good chance you were murdered right well he he
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:49.660]  basically uh to defend uh carmen uh ortiz her husband did a tweet that said that she had
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:55.660]  offered him a six-month deal and he turned it down not that he was looking at a 35-year sentence
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:14:00.380]  uh that twitter account has subsequently been taken down but that information got out and there
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:06.540]  were screenshots of it people got that from the archives also he was under indictment after he
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:11.580]  was still fighting these sopa pipa cispa acts even after he was in under indictment this guy was a
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:15.500]  fighter he was not somebody that's just gonna you know kill himself in despair i don't believe of
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:20.060]  course they murdered him but let's what they did let's look at a couple of clips from him uh the
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:24.380]  first one talks about some of the technical issues with cyber security it's just about 30 seconds can
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:31.100]  we go to that clip but i think it's really important that we stop cyber attacks and the
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:37.340]  way to do that is to make our cyber systems more secure to close the vulnerabilities that allow
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:41.900]  attackers to get it but the problem is the government's doing the opposite they are funding
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:47.100]  the creation of vulnerabilities they are offering rewards for people to find and build vulnerabilities
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:51.660]  in the system and give it to the us government so then the us government can launch cyber attacks
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:56.860]  in other countries now did you get that he said the real problem with cyber security is that the
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:15:02.220]  government is creating and funding them our government is creating it oh three years ago
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:07.100]  kurt nemo wrote an article where the head of cyber security uh at the pentagon is it's already going
[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:11.740]  i mean they're trying to get statutory authority said we're launching cyber attacks we're doing
[02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:15.980]  this we're building back doors that's why they say the chinese chips and our missiles and stuff
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:20.620]  it's not our missiles it's globalist missiles have these back doors because that was ordered
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:25.900]  in the specs everything has back doors absolutely and like you said before they basically have to
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:30.860]  tell in the same way they have to tell people when they're going to pull something off they also seem
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:36.860]  to even though they directly violate the constitution they are definitely trying to get this
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:40.620]  passed as a law even though the law is unconstitutional they feel that if they can get
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:45.180]  a law passed if they can get the supreme court to sign off on it just like asevedo was saying about
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:48.300]  gun control he says it doesn't matter what the constitution says or what the constitutional
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:54.380]  sheriff say if the if the congress passes a law and the supreme court says we're fine with that
[02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:58.220]  that trumps the constitution that essentially amends or nullifies the constitution so they're
[02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:02.620]  really pushing on this but the question is what does this bill do how does it violate the fourth
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:07.260]  amendment well even though it's our own government that is funding and creating these attacks these
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:13.740]  vulnerabilities as orin schwartz erin schwartz pointed out uh they're using this to come in and
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:17.420]  get information about you from they're going to use it to get information about you from facebook
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:21.180]  and twitter and they're going to do it in a devious way instead of the government coming in
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:26.540]  and saying we want that information they're going to provide liability protection to facebook and
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:31.740]  twitter and any corporation to voluntarily hand over that information to the fbi and you know
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:36.860]  i've been saying this since they told us in 2001 i was reading the minutes of the internet 2 meeting
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:41.020]  i think it was in london that year they've had it in austin and tokyo and other places
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:45.180]  and they said in the future we're going to shut off the old web but we're going to phase it into
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:50.380]  internet 2 where it's only institutions and big corporations you'll have to waive your rights to
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:54.780]  be on it and then there'll be no freedom because you've got to waive it to be on it but we're going
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:59.180]  to kill the old web and that's the plan they force you onto these pretty much government
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:03.500]  creations like zuckerberg's uh uh you know where he said they're dumb efforts he's at
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:09.580]  boulderberg group google all this and then you're on it and then it says you have no rights and so
[02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:14.140]  everything you're doing is spied on plus when you sign a contract to be on the cloud everything
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:19.420]  you're doing uh isn't yours now well this will also negate any privacy agreements between that
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:23.820]  that have been out there between uh facebook and users or twitter and users anything that's out
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:28.860]  there any faith any uh agreement to protect your privacy will be null and void if cispa goes
[02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:34.460]  through so it gives them liability protection exactly and so cispa supporters are outspending
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:40.780]  people who are opposing it by 140 to 1 605 million to push this thing through 605 million
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:45.100]  versus only 4 million to try to stop it and that's it's big defense contractors tell them about that
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:51.020]  up to 10 billion dollars per company just to spy on us right well mike rogers the 10 billion dollar
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:56.620]  figure comes from mike rogers wife now mike rogers is the congressman that's really spearheaded this
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:03.580]  he introduced he reintroduced cispa one month after aaron schwartz died and his wife is a former
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:10.700]  recently was the ceo and president of aegis incorporated and they just got a 10 billion dollar
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:15.260]  contract with the state department now aegis that's an offshore creep factory oh yeah yeah
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:20.220]  this is a this is the organization that had more soldiers on the ground private soldiers
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:25.740]  mercenary soldiers on the ground than the british had troops in iraq yeah so it's a bunch of foreign
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:31.900]  merc companies are taking over the web right now right and rogers wife who was the former ceo and
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:38.860]  president she just recently left uh she's around doing uh speeches on cyber security and that sort
[02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:44.060]  of thing so she's jumping on that bandwagon and again like i said this is a contract going to the
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:48.540]  state department but let's take a look at the second clip that we've got from aaron schwartz
[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:53.020]  can we play that clip right now it gives us kind of an insight into what congress's mindset is on
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:57.740]  this go ahead i was at an event and i got introduced to a u.s senator one of the strong
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:02.860]  proponents of the original coika bill and i asked him why despite being such a strong progressive
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:07.740]  despite having just given a speech in favor of civil liberties he was supporting a bill that
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:13.820]  would censor the internet and that typical politician's smile faded from his face and
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:19.980]  his eyes started burning this fiery red and he started shouting those people on the internet
[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:24.060]  he yelled they think they can get away with anything they think they can just put anything
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:29.100]  up and there's nothing we can do to stop them they put up everything they put up the plans
[02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:34.540]  to our fighter jets and they just laugh at us well we're going to show them there's going to
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:41.900]  be laws on the internet it's got to be under control now as far as i know no one has ever
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:48.060]  put up the plans to u.s fighter jets on the internet i mean that's just something i've heard
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:55.020]  about but that's sort of the point i mean it wasn't a rational concern it was this irrational
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:20:00.460]  fear that things were out of control all right hit pause here was this man a united states
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:05.500]  we're going to come back and finish this clip we're going to back it up and finish it and

[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:34.540]  i hate i hate call him drunk all right going back to uh david knight uh here with us in
[02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:39.260]  fullworks.com nightly news reporter uh the full clip we're gonna play on the nightly news tonight
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:44.060]  when you do another piece on this but uh there's a lot of these clips aaron swartz was a leader
[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:49.420]  and he was a real liberal not one of these fake tyrants and and absolutely the globalists are
[02:24:49.420 --> 02:24:55.580]  already stealing money left and right 85 billion dollars a month uh all of this is happening all
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:25:00.220]  of this is going on they're getting away with everything but they realize the public is finding
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:04.860]  out what liars they are so they want to censor the web but isn't the genie already out of the bottle
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:09.420]  well what i people are waking up and what i was going to show from that clip was that aaron
[02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:13.980]  schwartz kind of woke up here was a guy that he thought was on his side because he kind of bought
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:17.580]  into this left-right paradigm it's like oh this guy's a good liberal and so therefore he cares
[02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:23.340]  about civil liberties and he was surprised to see the anger and the hatred in that guy's attitude
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:27.100]  when he started talking about oh these people on the internet they're absolutely out of control
[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:31.580]  exactly what we saw in these press conferences last week where they said don't look at anything
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.980]  except what we give you right and we heard that they actually said only look at what we give you
[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:39.580]  right and we heard and they're in the news saying it's bad that citizens can look at photos
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:44.860]  and we heard that at sandy hook as well they want absolute total control of the flow of information
[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:49.420]  as well as control over the internet's meant to surveil us not allow us to surveil them
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:55.180]  absolutely and so he woke up to this and he said you know this is not somebody weighing the pluses
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:59.740]  and minuses of what would be good policy as he would think from a liberal perspective he said
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:04.700]  this is the attitude of a tyrant that's the way he ends that clip this is the attitude of a tyrant
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:10.060]  and so what we're hoping is is that people on the left as well as people on the right who would not
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:13.420]  typically care about this because a lot of times you mentioned security and you see a lot of the
[02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:18.060]  same people who are fighting so hard to stop the government from taking their second amendment
[02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:22.700]  rights they're not really interested in cispa that's not really their issue or civil liberties
[02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:28.220]  because they don't they think well i've done nothing wrong so what if they surveil me the
[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:33.900]  government's run by foreign banks and mercenary groups they want to use it to plant stuff on you
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:37.580]  to control you you're like well why is it wrong if they went door to door maybe people come out
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:43.820]  with their hands up what's wrong with that if they can do that they can condition people for the door
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:49.340]  to door gun confiscation you know you're like what do i have to hide if the troops check my my bag
[02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:54.780]  again and and and look at my papers i'm a good guy what if they're on a bad mission there's a reason
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:59.100]  we have a bill of rights and constitution and checks and balances because it will always be
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:04.300]  used to abuse us and it's not about things like a fighter jet plans being put out there it's about
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:09.020]  things like state department memos being leaked by wicked leaks that show their criminal actions
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:12.700]  of what they've been planning yeah they don't want it out with uh exactly they don't want them
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:16.860]  going we're criminals and murder these people and yeah torture these people and torture their
[02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:21.580]  families and we do the criminal now the unconstitutional later that's right exactly
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:25.980]  that's the memo that came out from henry kissinger we do the the illegal we do immediately the
[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:29.660]  unconstitutional takes a little while longer that came out in wicked leaks they don't want you to
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:34.060]  see that kind of stuff so that's why they want to get a gag around the internet that's why they
[02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:37.820]  want to get their hands around the throat of the internet and stop this kind of hey people in the
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:43.100]  federal government they had a colonel the week before 9 11 write an article in the washington
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:46.860]  post saying the government may stage a terror attack trying to warn people a year before 9 11
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:52.540]  they accidentally declassified in the stacks north woods they're trying to warn us there's good
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:57.020]  people in there and look at how they're going after all the whistleblowers right oh yeah back
[02:27:57.020 --> 02:28:03.660]  in north carolina uh senator richard burr uh came before i came out here he put in a bill specifically
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:08.460]  to go after whistleblowers very harsh penalties for whistleblowers they're trying to shut this
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:13.180]  down and even if you don't have anything to hide they have something to hide and we need to know
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:18.380]  hey they're calling whistleblowing they're wanting to put you in jail if you it's basically making
[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:22.620]  everything in government classified yes and then well you've seen them the cops trying to put people
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:29.340]  in jail for life if you film them in public the government is out of control it's the danger right
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:36.540]  and it uses these stages in one minute what do you make now of the boston stuff well i i just
[02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:41.260]  it doesn't the pattern of the younger brother just doesn't look like he's somebody that was involved
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:46.700]  in this that he knew what was going on i mean he's he's tweeting as after this happened he's going to
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:52.460]  a party thursday night uh every they went on the run after their pictures were put up that they
[02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:56.940]  were being looked at and now that looks like they arrested the brother and executed him right right
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:01.660]  and and it didn't it didn't make any sense looking at the early pictures his attitude with his cap
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:05.980]  flip back not trying to hide his face his backpack the wrong color and everything and now we see all
[02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:10.380]  this stuff about how they pump the uh boat like uh full of lead just like they did bonnie and
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:14.540]  collide or something i mean you know it's it's uh it's very suspicious and then he gets out and
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:19.100]  is able to get out but minutes later oh he's almost dead he can't yeah it looks like he's
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:23.420]  walking and then exactly they've got pictures of it looks like they they walked him out of the boat
[02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:28.060]  and then he's close to death the next time you see him just like the brother it appears might have
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:32.540]  been the one who was the naked man in the video and then all of a sudden he's riddled with bullets
[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:37.420]  and run over and that sort of thing or you know turns up dead yeah i mean look at how they burned
[02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:41.980]  up dorner and lied about it i mean there's no telling and again it's the classic cover-up and
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:46.540]  again folks i've had police when i was growing up threatened to frame me for stuff i mean it's well
[02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:51.020]  known they do this and boy you look at the police in boston i mean the way they're acting their body
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:55.980]  language saying press will kill you if you don't shut up this is all about a federal globalist

[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:35.900]  scowlson to get his take on all this we haven't had him on since the day after the event
[02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:42.060]  but he believes that all the tell-tale signs of a false flag staged event self-inflicted wound
[02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:49.020]  now it's got more signs than ever we know there was a drill we know they lied about
[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:53.820]  that we know they had a bunch of patsies on scene as of wednesday they were going to go with its
[02:33:53.820 --> 02:33:59.420]  right wingers and they had white house people out saying yeah that's who it's going to be
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:05.100]  wait the next day there's going to be something big happen and they flipped the script it looks
[02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:09.660]  like set up some of their patsies who they may have actually had plant the bombs which is a
[02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:15.420]  good lesson to you out there like tim mcveigh and others you do not want to be part of this they
[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:19.340]  will set you up in a minute mcveigh was real mad about the mission and told terry nichols
[02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:24.300]  and others about it about a week before but he still went ahead with it because he was under
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:32.460]  orders and you know what they did to him same thing with lee harvey oswald and now it's just
[02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:37.900]  hands down the fbi knew who they were when they put their picture out and then called him up if
[02:34:37.900 --> 02:34:44.300]  the mother's accurate and said we're going to come on by and get you and then they for whatever
[02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:51.500]  reason drugged him up or had already shot him laid him out ran over him and then shot him up much
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:57.740]  more and then they wanted that other brother bad and they tried to kill him but media had gotten
[02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:01.340]  their cameras on it so they were unable after shooting hundreds of rounds into it when he
[02:35:01.340 --> 02:35:06.460]  actually got up oh my goodness you know he's unarmed with his hands up don't worry we'll get
[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:12.780]  him in the tent get medical personnel over here to help him out but it was a little too obvious
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:18.300]  if he died on the spot they made the call hey the kid doesn't know the whole story well try him
[02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:23.660]  suspect charged in boston bombing case still in serious condition with gunshot wounds was
[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:28.540]  arraigned in the hospital monday on federal charges in connection with boston marathon
[02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:34.860]  and he wasn't given miranda so far and is quote drugged being asked questions you can put somebody
[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:39.340]  on halcyon and say hey you committed murders didn't you yeah i did and you're superman too
[02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:45.020]  aren't you yeah i am and you're also a cable or elf right yeah i am living that big green tree
[02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:51.740]  i mean they now drug up the the aurora shooter for trial i mean just give me a break
[02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:55.100]  i guess north vietnam drugging our pilots was good then
[02:35:57.260 --> 02:36:00.540]  let's go to julio and illinois then we got our guests coming on go ahead julio
[02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:08.460]  oh man alex it's uh it's kind of comical and sad at the same time watching the narrative
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:13.660]  this continuous narrative being thrown at us but big brother in the corporate media
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:19.500]  you know if this were a movie it would be kind of like a sick comedy because uh the public knows
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:24.700]  what's going on well most of the public i should say and yet the big bros throwing this narrative
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:31.820]  at us they shut down a big metropolitan city like boston for a 19 year old kid i mean if that's a
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:38.380]  joke for for them to throw this narrative at us uh i remember i stood up all night thursday night
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:44.620]  in a friday morning and they said the naked guy was uh suspect number one initial report
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:50.460]  and then within a half hour to an hour away it's not him it was just someone else they wanted to
[02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:55.900]  make it because he had he may have had bomb residue auto and alex uh quickly i called your
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:37:02.300]  show i interviewed me last uh summer last july after the tsa and amtrak police followed me after
[02:37:02.300 --> 02:37:07.740]  i released the video yeah they said you cannot tell them on the streets of chicago yes right
[02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:14.140]  i i i mentioned a document from homeland security and da uh homeland security and the fbi they did
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:20.460]  a roll call after the aurora shootings about how they were going to be bombings at large gatherings
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:25.660]  and here we are a year later and then boom it happens this is a false flag they tell us what
[02:37:25.660 --> 02:37:31.180]  happens here's beforehand just like a operation of malcolm burgo two months ten days before 9 11
[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:37.740]  bin man's picture on the document of the of an exercise that happened on 9 11 it's the same thing
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:41.820]  they're telling us in advance what's going to happen they tell the police they get everything
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:46.940]  ready it happens and oh now we have to give up more right as peter king of new york tells us
[02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:52.300]  or miss lindsey graham well yeah i mean that's what really tells you what's happening is the
[02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:57.020]  police think we're such animals they now do proctology exams on the side of the street
[02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:03.420]  in austin texas and other areas or or the state police do on the highway with the same glove
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:10.060]  multiple women four orifices just off the chart stuff and now in boston the videos are emerging
[02:38:10.060 --> 02:38:14.940]  where they would just go door to door and say come out and have families you know with their
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:20.460]  children you name it come out with their hands up and the cops would get in their face and grab on
[02:38:20.460 --> 02:38:25.580]  them and i'm telling you it's illegal it's unlawful it's martial law and they call it
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:30.380]  security they call it national security and yes you were on as a guest reporting for we are change
[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:35.100]  with all the footage that made the news where the tsa is on the streets now saying you can't
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:40.620]  film them as they search people's bags and stuff without warrants and it's just all part of the new
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:45.180]  government takeover where they're the new class they're the new god and it's all part of the
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:49.340]  conditioning and this is what they train kids in public schools during drills to come out with
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:54.620]  their hands up uh and again even if you look nothing like the people just door to door
[02:38:55.740 --> 02:39:00.380]  uh just just i mean it's so pathetic and hey don't worry cops the globalists are doing this
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:03.820]  to take your pension funds they're doing this getting us ready for the financial collapse
[02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:08.940]  and through that we're supposed to all become collectivized and go on food stamps and stuff but
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:13.260]  i mean i mean i'm here to tell you it's illegal uh and if anybody would have said no they'd have
[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:17.500]  blown your house up burned it down like dorner and said you were a terrorist good that's more
[02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:23.500]  people for them to show off with and and act like their heroes and go after your family now again
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:27.660]  a lot of police are listeners of this show and a lot of departments wouldn't act like this but
[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:35.180]  boston is a town that i don't even want to enter uh because it's so creepy uh and and i mean the
[02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:40.940]  police look like fred flinstone uh and and of course after the lockdown ended somebody found
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:44.620]  the guy in the boat because he could go outside now and of course it was outside the lockdown
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:50.220]  now joel scowlson writes for world affairs brief he's the editor joel scowlson uh of course you can
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:55.820]  go to his website worldaffairsbrief.com joelscowlson.com will also get you there we sell
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:00.860]  his book and i produce the film with him strategic relocation depending on which region you're in
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:05.260]  the safer areas to be in like i live in the hill country right outside austin that he rates as the
[02:40:05.260 --> 02:40:09.420]  safest before i read his book i did my own research and it shows you how accurate it is i've been all
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:13.100]  over the country and it's like how does he know all this well he's worked all over the nation
[02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:18.860]  building secure homes for um government and wealthy right down to you know regular folks
[02:40:18.860 --> 02:40:25.020]  he's written the best-selling book the secure home all available at info war store.com i should add
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:31.020]  and joel you just heard uh julia we are change reporter talking about what happened uh but this
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:37.420]  is a great reason to get out of the city what do you make of of just the whole psyop we're seeing
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:44.380]  what we now know about tammerlin uh what we now know about the family the russians blowing his
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:49.980]  cover with the fbi and saying who is this guy you're sending into terror camps that are state
[02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:55.260]  department funded uh other aliases are coming out in the news they were allowed to travel around
[02:40:55.260 --> 02:41:00.860]  with other aliases looks like more setups and you know you kill the spy but then the little brother
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:05.900]  he'll make for good fodder he's now charged joel i don't know your take since we talked six days
[02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:13.100]  ago the day after the bombing on wednesday or on tuesday what is your take as an expert on false
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:21.420]  flag joel scousin i think alex it's very clear that the two brothers were involved in some type
[02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:29.580]  of false flag training and operation but it was clear to them that when they showed up and when
[02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:35.580]  the bombs went off and they fled and by the way we have video of the younger brother fleeing with
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:41.180]  his backpack on him so we know that what the fbi said about him dropping his pack could not have
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:49.420]  been true but that they realized that oh something else has gone off and they fled i think this is
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:56.700]  very very typical of what happens when you you set up a patsy you put him in charge or you put him
[02:41:56.700 --> 02:42:01.260]  in with another group of people and you give them a certain assignment to be down at the area so
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:06.940]  that they can be arrested or so that they can be filmed but you have other people do the actual
[02:42:06.940 --> 02:42:13.580]  explosions to make sure it comes off correctly not leaving it to amateurs and so i'm very worried
[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:19.260]  that we had we do have a larger group here and that larger group has to involve an agent
[02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:27.260]  provocateur provided by the fbi almost every single terrorist prosecution of lone individuals
[02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:33.100]  planning to bomb something in the united states and britain have involved what the government
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:38.300]  says an fbi informant but we know that they're much more informants because they admit under oath
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:45.660]  in the trials that they in fact provided the you know the hype they provided the egging them on
[02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:50.300]  they provided the explosives they provided the plans they provided the leadership they normally
[02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:57.180]  some cases take some two years giving them money commanding them in the name of allah to do this
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:43:03.020]  that's right and so i clearly think that these boys were involved in an operation had gone
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:09.500]  and at least tamarind had been sent back to the far east in order to get training or to
[02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:16.140]  to move around and that's when the russians picked him up here and came back but you know it was
[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:21.420]  obvious from their statements when they came back they didn't flee uh they went to a par
[02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:26.380]  at least the young one went to a party he seemed normal he talked to people as if nothing had
[02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:30.620]  happened he told his mother that they didn't do it that he was going to be set up though
[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:35.420]  but i think they knew that when the bomb went off without whatever participation they'd been
[02:43:35.420 --> 02:43:41.020]  briefed for that they were going to be set up i think it was interesting though that the police
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:48.380]  or the fbi called um a couple of days after that and and uh and talked to them and and yet they
[02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:56.540]  didn't arrest them immediately and uh i don't know if they wanted them to flee i'm still unclear alex
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:44:03.500]  what this uh mit cop had to do or the carjacking had to do with this the one thing i'm really
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:11.500]  concerned about is what new evidence appears to show that tamarlin in fact was captured and told
[02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:17.260]  to strip naked in order to check him for bombs and then put in a police car recognized by the aunt
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:22.780]  who said she's 100 sure that this was tamarlin oh we've got the video by the way on infowars.com
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:26.700]  in fact i'll pull that up for viewers in a moment radio listeners and go see it it looks like
[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:33.820]  spitting image he has a you know kind of unique bone structure uh to his face and um and again
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:39.180]  he was like a boxer playboy type uh not religious reportedly did drugs and things i mean this really
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:44.460]  fits the mo absolutely and now you have witnesses saying they had his body out there and the cops
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:48.780]  ran over him and then filled him full of holes go ahead yeah that's the important thing is that if
[02:44:48.780 --> 02:44:55.100]  he was in police custody then what was he doing out there in a shootout now i believe this police
[02:44:55.100 --> 02:45:03.740]  chief mr devo must have been making up a tremendous story when he talked to wolf blitzer on cnn
[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:08.620]  because everything that he talked about was false you know as a former military officer i listened
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:15.980]  to his his uh scenario where he's talking about these two guys approaching this f uv this roadblock
[02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:20.140]  they've got set up and they get out of the car and they start start to have a huge shootout
[02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:26.220]  hundreds of rounds being exchanged uh nobody apparently hit or if they're wounded they're
[02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:31.020]  back in the car and then all of a sudden the older brother supposedly gets out and he starts walking
[02:45:31.020 --> 02:45:36.860]  towards them in a suicide manner you know shooting at them and they wound him and then they say well
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:43.180]  our police guys went and tackled him and handcuffed him and then the younger kid you know got in the
[02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:48.700]  suv and and drove towards but instead we have footage that i mean not just the face the
[02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:53.820]  shoulders the bone structure you know the boxer body uh reportedly that you know they call they
[02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:57.580]  go we're coming to get you they strip him down they walk him out and then they have a fake
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:46:04.780]  firefight and you listen to the supposed firefight it sounds like one way i mean man this is really
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:10.460]  bad and here's my issue it's so sloppy joel scowzen uh they're gonna be just joined as
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:16.060]  editor-in-chief at worldaffairsbrief.com they were saying white house officials former white
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:21.660]  house officials axelrod and others tuesday night they said look it's it's going to be lone wolf
[02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:26.140]  domestics by themselves by wednesday they said we got them some big announcement it's going to
[02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:31.340]  be the tea party they had a celebration on msnbc cnn i have the clips i played them they said yeah
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:35.500]  this is going to look like it's lone wolf right wing because they can't help but brag to themselves
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:40.140]  and then something that we and others that became the number one thing searched on the web that day
[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:45.980]  put out freak them out they withdraw it they say okay there hadn't been an arrest they evacuate the
[02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:50.380]  courthouse where it's at army vehicles drive in drive out there's a panic they throw all the media
[02:46:50.380 --> 02:46:57.340]  out and then the next uh day they release thursday the photos and say look at nothing else
[02:46:57.340 --> 02:47:02.060]  is this a false flag that completely blew up in their face and they had to switch to a backup plan
[02:47:04.460 --> 02:47:09.260]  well not knowing the the complexities of this i know that they are ad-libbing on the spot and
[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:15.260]  that's a lot of what they were dealing with right here i'm convinced first of all there had to be
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:20.780]  something that the two brothers were involved in and it had to be larger than them they were given
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:25.660]  an assignment to be there and they were watched by a federal agent as you carefully pointed out
[02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:30.060]  on one of your videos and they could have arrested them the same time you know the fbi had been in
[02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:36.460]  contact with these people at least three years before even though the fbi says only six months
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:41.900]  ago and i think they're lying the mother could not have been that far off in her time and when
[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:48.780]  she said three to five years let's just say even if it's three years at the earliest they said and
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:53.180]  at the time that they've been watching and tapping every one of their phones they watch everything on
[02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:59.660]  the internet there's no way they could not have known what they were planning so this proves alex
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:03.980]  that this is a false flag operation meaning they're part of a group that they know is planning
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:07.740]  they're monitoring all of their emails they're monitoring all of their internet activity
[02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:13.420]  that only can mean that they intended this operation to go forward but they were looking
[02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:17.980]  for a couple of the members of this group that they're going to take down as a patsy
[02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:23.180]  and i don't think we're going to find the so-called rest of the group and i think that's
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:29.980]  one of the reasons why they wanted both these brothers dead and we may find out that and there's
[02:48:29.980 --> 02:48:35.180]  a problem of course with jakhar the the younger in the sense that he does not appear to be wounded
[02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:39.580]  when he comes out of the boat and all of a sudden they say there's a self-inflicted gunshot he
[02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:45.820]  doesn't even have a gun in his hand alex how could he have done a self-inflicted wound to the throat
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:49.660]  and then five minutes later from the video stills we slowed him down one by one it looks like
[02:48:49.660 --> 02:48:54.220]  they're doing a tracheotomy on him so you're walking you're walking and now your throat's
[02:48:54.220 --> 02:48:58.140]  cut out and then they said he may never talk again i mean this is so obvious
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:04.620]  well we've seen a lot of history of false flag operations in this country and you know
[02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:10.220]  there's a lot of them going clear back to the battleship maine the blowing up of the maine
[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:14.220]  the pearl harbor is one of the best that we have evidence on we have a tremendous amount of
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:19.660]  evidence on the oklahoma city bombing that it had to be larger than the makvey bomb it had to
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:24.220]  involve multiple bombs that's right pearl harbor was a stand down but still a false flag that's
[02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:30.700]  right uh and any and of course 9 11 we have tremendous information i just reviewed the new
[02:49:30.700 --> 02:49:37.900]  video of showcasing the life of stephen jones who discovered the thermite and documented the
[02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:44.700]  evidence as well as other scientists and it is a foolproof case that the government used
[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:49.900]  explosives in bringing down these towers nanothermite developed by nasa that's right
[02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:54.620]  and this was a brand of nanotherm number there's even more powerful than the existing nanothermite
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:59.740]  that they were able to get samples of so we have a tremendous amount of information about these
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:05.980]  things and frankly after listening to police chiefs duro and others we simply can't trust
[02:50:05.980 --> 02:50:11.020]  anything well i mean i go off my gut too i mean i think that police chief comes off like a big fat
[02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:16.860]  gangster to me well you know what i was trying to say before i got interrupted when you know as a
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:22.060]  military officer listening these guys apparently according to police chiefs throw bombs at them
[02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:28.060]  had pipe bombs and had another similar big bomb that put out a big explosion first of all the
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:33.500]  the tape recording don't show that any of those bombings are true it's just the police word for
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:38.220]  it and secondarily are we to believe that they're going to come out from under the cover of their
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:43.340]  cars and tackle this guy after he runs out of ammunition knowing that the brother is still there
[02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:49.820]  in the suv with bombs with weapons and they're going to come out of their cover and tackle this
[02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:54.860]  guy it just doesn't make sense in fact we know that from another witness that in fact that never
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:51:01.100]  happened that in fact it was a police suv that ran down hammerlin joel joel i can tell you're

[02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:04.860]  be honest with you i get on air and just get so many data points that it makes my brain burn
[02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:10.220]  because i'm frustrated to see the same thing repeating itself and it's not my opinion that
[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:15.900]  there's a false flag all the signs are there i wish this wasn't a false flag because at least
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:20.220]  it would just be some little group of crazies what's scary is is that they're going forward
[02:55:20.220 --> 02:55:26.460]  with this joel i want to in the next hour with you have you really lay out all the inconsistencies
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:30.700]  that you with precision are breaking down because i have the same inconsistencies here but i
[02:55:30.700 --> 02:55:35.660]  start hyperventilating it gets me so upset to see this happening but i wanted to just briefly before
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:41.740]  this hour ends ask you what is the political reasoning of this what is their goal obviously
[02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:48.540]  it's a smokescreen and what do you make of what i call martial law being declared and i mean let
[02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:51.980]  me tell you the cops shut down a whole city and say we're coming to your house to aim guns at you
[02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:57.020]  and your family that's illegal and that's a form of assault and i've had enough of it and i'm not
[02:55:57.020 --> 02:56:01.500]  looking for some type of physical deal but i've had enough joel scowlson you're a constitutionalist
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:07.260]  what do you say on that front it's interesting they never used the word martial law in boston
[02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:13.580]  public safety and it was just public safety national security and they hyped up on everybody's
[02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:18.620]  patriotism about this to simply lay down and let the police do anything they want nobody was
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:22.780]  thinking about saying to the police no you can't come in where's your warrant where's the probable
[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:28.540]  cause and that's what happens when you get that shows the power of this conflict creation motive
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:33.260]  think what will happen someday when they have nuclear war in america they won't have to declare
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:38.140]  martial law they're simply going to start running through the streets and everyone will say whatever
[02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:44.780]  you want to do whatever it takes save us from the situation so i think it was very powerful lesson
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:54.060]  of how far we've moved into uh you know exceeding to america failed a big test friday it did indeed
[02:56:54.060 --> 02:57:00.540]  it did indeed um let me walk through first of all the main these big ins consist that before i ask
[02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:04.540]  to the answer the general question on where i think they're taking us for this in the first
[02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:09.420]  place it's very important to understand that we have forensic evidence that shows that at least
[02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:15.260]  one of the explosions the backpack that housed that explosive was a black back pack that it had
[02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:21.980]  a square label on it and it had white strips or on the black straps that were on the pack
[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:31.260]  neither the pack of jakar uh sarnia or his brother tamarind matched that description
[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:38.780]  number two we have the video of of uh jakar uh fleeing the scene after the bombing with his pack
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:46.300]  on his back so he did not plant the bomb his brother did not plant the bomb that went off
[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:50.860]  now that means that someone else did it it was very very suspicious the government would point
[02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:56.620]  to only these two people when obviously someone else planted the bomb and say whatever you do
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:58:02.300]  don't look at anybody else very suspicious that's right i mean they knew there's some tremendous
[02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:06.060]  independent research went on and it it was especially focusing on these other
[02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:13.340]  private security contractors uh one of which did lose his pack the packs did match in fact
[02:58:13.340 --> 02:58:18.060]  the explosive profile with the square patch on the back and i'm not saying it's enough conclusive
[02:58:18.060 --> 02:58:24.140]  evidence to say that one of those but they were clearly in the area expecting some type of
[02:58:24.140 --> 02:58:29.900]  activity and they had moved away from where the bomb actually went off were in another position
[02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:35.820]  and they did not react as first responders when it went off not whatsoever except to get off the
[02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:40.620]  get on their radios and telephones immediately start to communicate about them but we are left
[02:58:40.620 --> 02:58:44.060]  begging the question what are these big backpacks that they're all wearing have
[02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:47.340]  stay there back in 60 seconds with joel scales and i'm alex jones

[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:43.100]  uh like the folks picking up the broadcast there in jacksonville florida let's pick it up 24 hours
[03:00:43.100 --> 03:00:47.820]  a day very exciting uh joel scousins our guest this is a short segment long segment coming up
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:55.180]  and i will get to your calls folks that are holding um okay we're now getting to the point
[03:00:55.180 --> 03:01:00.780]  of the question it's only a five minute segment of what is the motive in all of this i mean it's
[03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:05.020]  the classic thing of letters being mailed out they have a mentally ill patsy on that just like
[03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:11.340]  the anthrax is a continued cover you've got cispa you've got the immigration bill you've got giving
[03:01:11.340 --> 03:01:18.460]  homeland security more power uh you've got america failing the test you know usa means being under
[03:01:18.460 --> 03:01:25.260]  martial law uh what else do you see happening here joel well i don't once again think that
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:29.580]  martial law is imminent this is one of the acclimating type things there would be many
[03:01:29.580 --> 03:01:34.780]  more even obama said there's going to be more terrorist attacks i think the number one motive
[03:01:34.780 --> 03:01:40.700]  for this is that it had been a long time since we'd had another one of these high profile terror
[03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:45.820]  attacks remember we don't have any normal terrorism in the united states normal terrorism would look
[03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:51.500]  like people coming across the border among the thousands of illegal aliens that come across daily
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:55.820]  and they'd be blowing up electrical pylons they'd be putting setting off suicide bombers in malls
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:02:02.860]  small non-high profile things these high profile things are always a sign that there is something
[03:02:02.860 --> 03:02:07.900]  to be gained that's right real terrorists hit train tracks that's right this is a propaganda
[03:02:07.900 --> 03:02:13.420]  stunt and you know you and i had discussed and i know i've heard you say this before and i've said
[03:02:13.420 --> 03:02:20.060]  it before my world affairs brief that they've got to have another major terrorist event in order to
[03:02:20.060 --> 03:02:24.300]  keep people believing in this war on terror there was a great deal of fatigue about it people are
[03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:29.900]  tired oh no we've been saying attacks are imminent because every tv show the dramas are all about
[03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:35.660]  this now you can see the scripting and so they eventually had to make a self-fulfilling prophecy
[03:02:35.660 --> 03:02:40.540]  come true and i think that was the major role of this the secondary role is that this is going to
[03:02:40.540 --> 03:02:45.260]  give a greater justification to build homeland security into the major domestic police force
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:49.260]  they won't need u.n troops we're going to have hundreds of thousands of other
[03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:55.660]  you know people brought in to homeland security they're going to be militarized to the extent i
[03:02:55.660 --> 03:03:01.980]  was shocked at how much top military automatic weapons armored personnel carry that they brought
[03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:08.220]  out for this uh if they don't have this stockpiled in boston and they brought it out from long way
[03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:12.780]  away no no that's what my military sources not that they're even high level they're there they
[03:03:12.780 --> 03:03:19.580]  say there's caches of warrior fighting vehicles all of it everywhere for this and so this is
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:24.940]  really disturbing alex that there's this much power firepower in an urban one urban area of
[03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:30.380]  the united states that was brought to bear on this so that and and and the surprising thing
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:33.900]  they didn't have to declare martial art they just said everybody stay in your homes and everybody
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:39.340]  stayed in their homes i mean shut down everything essentially and some people disregarded it but
[03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:45.500]  very very few let me before you continue let me just finish my train of thought before this on
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:51.180]  these anomalies it's very important to understand that the fbi knew where these two brothers were
[03:03:51.180 --> 03:03:56.540]  they knew where they lived they had been to their home before that is white side agents i think when
[03:03:56.540 --> 03:04:02.700]  the russians responded and put out an interrogative with the fbi they they don't send over the dark
[03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:08.860]  side operators who were running these um domestic terrorist groups they send over white side guys
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:12.700]  to do an interview and that's why they were so open about warning them look we've got information
[03:04:12.700 --> 03:04:16.860]  about terrorism they're watching your internet they admitted all of these things so if they
[03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:21.740]  were truly the bombers involved why would they go back to their house knowing that the fbi
[03:04:21.740 --> 03:04:28.540]  knew where they lived the fbi calls them at their house they answer the phone why do you see would
[03:04:28.540 --> 03:04:33.260]  that happen why didn't they just go over and arrest them rather than call them beforehand
[03:04:33.260 --> 03:04:40.140]  i'll tell you what i think i think they wanted to flush them out and make them run so that they
[03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:46.220]  would have an excuse to kill them so that they would be dead and dead men can't talk i think
[03:04:46.220 --> 03:04:51.580]  that's what recap that because how is the controlled medium we come back to hide all this

[03:08:11.420 --> 03:08:25.980]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:25.980 --> 03:08:32.940]  it is incredibly transparent what's happening here you've got the intelligence agency connections to
[03:08:32.940 --> 03:08:37.820]  the brothers you've got him being reportedly brought to the car it's him and then dead and
[03:08:37.820 --> 03:08:42.220]  witnesses saying no they put him in the street and ran over him and then shot him full of holes
[03:08:43.180 --> 03:08:47.020]  uh i mean this is just outrageous and they tried to kill the other brother i was listening to the
[03:08:47.020 --> 03:08:51.980]  scanners live because they had them over ustream the boston police were like oh no the media's got
[03:08:51.980 --> 03:08:58.140]  in pull them back and and and they couldn't stop the media showing the boat they'd shot full of
[03:08:58.140 --> 03:09:05.420]  holes hundreds of holes looks like 30 40 yards of cops with you know full auto opening up on that
[03:09:05.420 --> 03:09:11.020]  boat trying to quote kill the suspect then they go over and he just stands up and now they knew
[03:09:11.020 --> 03:09:15.340]  the media had a live feed because this all happened like five minutes because the media
[03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:20.220]  had gotten around uh and was filming from above from a building and i was listening to police
[03:09:20.220 --> 03:09:25.580]  going the colonel says get them out of there no no hold on and you can hear them all trying to
[03:09:25.580 --> 03:09:30.780]  talk with code the average cop of course is compartmentalized as well and then he stands
[03:09:30.780 --> 03:09:36.460]  up okay he's fine he walks over minutes later oh he can't talk he may die uh they do not want him
[03:09:36.460 --> 03:09:41.900]  talking to people and again he's a 19 year old kid probably being tagging along with his brother
[03:09:41.900 --> 03:09:47.180]  joel scowlson you were bringing up the point of why it's now coming out the mother says that they
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:53.180]  called them after the bombing and then they called him right before they came and arrested him uh
[03:09:53.180 --> 03:09:59.340]  tammerlin the older one and they ended up dead i mean uh and and now the witness is coming out
[03:09:59.340 --> 03:10:05.500]  contradicting what the police said again this is not going well for them what are other points you
[03:10:05.500 --> 03:10:10.940]  think are important to make here well the most important point is there is no reason to ever
[03:10:10.940 --> 03:10:15.980]  telephone someone that you've already announced to the world these are the people that we're looking
[03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:21.900]  for why telephone them unless you want to flush them out i mean they even knew where they lived
[03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:26.140]  they were sitting in the residence where the fbi had been before there's no way that they
[03:10:26.140 --> 03:10:31.020]  wouldn't just show up at the door and arrest them if that was their intent the telephone call in my
[03:10:31.020 --> 03:10:36.940]  opinion was meant to flush them out so they would go on the run and then on the run they could run
[03:10:36.940 --> 03:10:42.300]  them into a police situation where they could kill them and that's exactly what happened though
[03:10:42.300 --> 03:10:46.940]  i think it got a little bit complex with the fact that they end up trying to hijack a car in order
[03:10:46.940 --> 03:10:54.700]  to get some atm money uh and they have this other suv but clearly i think the police have them under
[03:10:54.700 --> 03:11:00.700]  surveillance for the time they leave their house and so they're waiting for the proper time to get
[03:11:01.420 --> 03:11:07.980]  the non-conspirator police involved and set up and kind of funneled into this roadblock situation
[03:11:07.980 --> 03:11:12.540]  of course they're tracking them they claim that they were tracking them by the cell phone that
[03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:18.060]  the hijacked suv left behind in the car but i don't believe that i think that they had them
[03:11:18.060 --> 03:11:24.060]  tracked from the time they left their uh the apartment building and intended to kill them both
[03:11:24.060 --> 03:11:29.740]  and that's why they've got i think they had to hurt the throat of the person they saw them get
[03:11:29.740 --> 03:11:35.100]  out they couldn't simply say that he was dead on arrival because people and and the media saw him
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:41.580]  walk out of that boat he wasn't dripping blood everywhere so i think they had to invent something
[03:11:41.580 --> 03:11:47.980]  else this is a really a sloppy operation and they're almost always sloppy but in the past
[03:11:47.980 --> 03:11:54.300]  there wasn't cameras everywhere to pick up every angle of this and now they're calling to censor
[03:11:54.300 --> 03:11:59.260]  citizen video and media because it quote got in the way of the investigation that's all over the
[03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:03.180]  news today when it's the opposite but you know my dad said to me last night when i went over
[03:12:03.180 --> 03:12:08.860]  and visited him and my mom for a bite to eat he said he goes you know it's they're so obviously
[03:12:08.860 --> 03:12:13.340]  guilty when they're like don't look at anything else and our reporter takes over the press
[03:12:13.340 --> 03:12:18.940]  conference and and you know says we have the photos of the other people at info wars.com
[03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:25.900]  we got 16 million extra visitors that day alone it's got to shake up the system to know that
[03:12:25.900 --> 03:12:31.340]  you're out there i'm out there the white house says don't listen to the drudge report what do
[03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:36.060]  you make of the saudi connections as well because you know okay there's some saudis there but this
[03:12:36.060 --> 03:12:41.180]  guy does have family on the terror watch list they did have the ambassador visit they are acting very
[03:12:41.180 --> 03:12:47.260]  suspicious they are ignoring all this other stuff i mean from studying past false flags they'll
[03:12:47.260 --> 03:12:51.820]  usually have five or six groups there like oklahoma city so they can blame whoever they want
[03:12:52.860 --> 03:12:58.460]  well the saudis are an interesting case because you know they were very much involved in providing
[03:12:58.460 --> 03:13:04.460]  most of the hijackers for the uh the 911 and there were hijackers there this was a government
[03:13:04.460 --> 03:13:09.980]  operation from beginning to end but they hired hijackers in fact i'm convinced that these
[03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:15.020]  hijackers got training in large aircraft in saudi arabia or another middle eastern country where
[03:13:15.020 --> 03:13:19.020]  they could get their hand where the governments themselves provided this training you didn't get
[03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:24.860]  that from flying cessnas it's just too complex an airplane and i say that as a pilot you know
[03:13:24.860 --> 03:13:30.060]  it'd be very difficult even who just famously survived an aircraft that say nobody else has
[03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:35.820]  recently well even as a military fighter pilot myself it'd be very difficult for me to handle
[03:13:35.820 --> 03:13:41.020]  one of those large aircraft the complexity the switches and and you were a carrier pilot they
[03:13:41.020 --> 03:13:46.060]  said that's the hardest thing out there that's right so i'm not buying that the hijackers you
[03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:50.540]  know what about the maneuvers of honey honjour that nine out of ten pilots say they couldn't
[03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:56.540]  even do well personally i don't think that the hijackers were in fact actually flying
[03:13:56.540 --> 03:14:01.980]  the planes that ended up going into the world trades i agree because for example the second
[03:14:01.980 --> 03:14:07.100]  plane that went into the world trades had a huge modification on the bottom of it a bulging area
[03:14:07.100 --> 03:14:13.100]  which was probably fuel enhancement uh area uh in tank i think that they were probably under
[03:14:13.100 --> 03:14:20.860]  remote control at that point clearly the pentagon aircraft were very difficult to fly and i think
[03:14:20.860 --> 03:14:25.420]  that there were two aircraft involved in the pentagon the proof of that is that there was
[03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:33.180]  a large portion of the radome of the 757 inside the pentagon and you can't do that if you crash
[03:14:33.180 --> 03:14:37.820]  at 500 miles an hour into a reinforced concrete wall there wouldn't be anything larger than a half
[03:14:37.820 --> 03:14:43.340]  inch of that radome the only reason a portion a major portion of the radome could get inside the
[03:14:43.340 --> 03:14:48.460]  building is if another smaller aircraft had launched a missile at the building created a hole
[03:14:49.340 --> 03:14:55.100]  and that it would explain the white flash at the pentagon crash which yeah that's as high explosive
[03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:59.740]  yeah i mean and again people say that's so confusing that's how they do these ops so no
[03:14:59.740 --> 03:15:05.180]  one knows what they saw because it's so confused on purpose yeah i think there were two aircraft
[03:15:05.180 --> 03:15:09.740]  there was a larger airline and there was a smaller commuter size air which other witnesses saw
[03:15:10.460 --> 03:15:16.460]  the most important witness that i saw was the one who said that the actual airliner did not
[03:15:16.460 --> 03:15:20.860]  penetrate the building and in fact it crumpled up against the wall and he made the statement to
[03:15:20.860 --> 03:15:27.020]  himself the wall held up like a champ and then he said the the airplane exploded into a thousand
[03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:34.380]  pieces and that matches my scenario where i believe these the airline size was loaded with
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:40.620]  explosives and that explains why there were just confetti-like size pieces all around the part
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:46.060]  there were thousands of pieces of aluminum everywhere so i think that one witness is the
[03:15:46.060 --> 03:15:51.100]  recording of what really happened the smaller aircraft put a missile in second aircraft hit
[03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:57.260]  almost simultaneously maybe a little bit later which most people saw and then exploded to destroy
[03:15:57.260 --> 03:16:03.420]  the evidence sure joel scowlson what do you expect to come uh out of all of this so far i mean if it
[03:16:03.420 --> 03:16:08.540]  hasn't gone well for them and i mean i listen to local talk radio and they're talking like i am
[03:16:08.540 --> 03:16:13.020]  almost every caller's agreeing i was swimming laps out of martin springs this weekend a group
[03:16:13.020 --> 03:16:17.180]  of military guys and their wives and they were like special ops guys you know they were in great
[03:16:17.180 --> 03:16:20.860]  shape we're talking about and they couldn't even see me you know i was sitting there with a towel
[03:16:20.860 --> 03:16:26.380]  on my head and i just got there and and i was laying out you know under a tree and they were
[03:16:26.380 --> 03:16:31.180]  all talking about oklahoma city being an inside job and how they thought this was an inside job
[03:16:31.180 --> 03:16:36.540]  and when i talked to them they didn't even know who i was so everywhere is the buzz that this was
[03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:43.580]  staged well you know it's interesting that the majority of information comes out later and when
[03:16:43.580 --> 03:16:48.860]  it continues to point towards only things that government could do is at 9 11 you know only
[03:16:48.860 --> 03:16:53.340]  government could have loaded all those explosives in the world trade center even if you believe that
[03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:58.780]  only world trade center 7 was loaded with explosives still you've got to explain that the
[03:16:58.780 --> 03:17:03.180]  terrorists could not have done that and so the more the government covers up the more that the
[03:17:03.180 --> 03:17:10.060]  government silences information fails to explain things the more that it alerts the more than one
[03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:15.740]  third of the american people that i believe are suspicious about american involvement in 9 11
[03:17:15.740 --> 03:17:20.940]  it alerts that third to the fact that we've got another false flag terrorist operation to deal
[03:17:20.940 --> 03:17:26.700]  with now the government has said they're looking for an additional cell of some 12 people they kind
[03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:30.620]  of give it away there's no way you'd know that there's a cell of 12 unless maybe they were
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:38.780]  handling that cell but uh or just throwing out a number but i'm not so sure they're going to find
[03:17:38.780 --> 03:17:43.340]  much of a cell here i think they're going to pin the blame on both of these they'll have another
[03:17:43.340 --> 03:17:48.620]  terrorist attack under their belt and americans will be very much more convinced that we have a
[03:17:48.620 --> 03:17:54.140]  real uh war on terror that now includes chechnya now i want to make one point very clear that
[03:17:54.140 --> 03:17:58.780]  mainstream media continues to put out the propaganda the yes when they're talking about
[03:17:58.780 --> 03:18:03.980]  russia assisting the fbi in this investigation how russia has been the victim of chechen terrorism
[03:18:03.980 --> 03:18:11.500]  as well this is absolutely untrue is that almost all of the chechen terrorism or terrorism in russia
[03:18:11.500 --> 03:18:16.460]  the apartment buildings the breslin bombings of the school that was putin to get re-elected
[03:18:16.460 --> 03:18:22.940]  were blamed on chechens were in fact carried out by russian speakers not chechens uh the hotel
[03:18:22.940 --> 03:18:27.900]  bombings and the apartment bombings were all done well it even came out on the bislon shooting which
[03:18:27.900 --> 03:18:33.420]  is an example of school shootings the local witnesses all saw the military run out the back
[03:18:33.420 --> 03:18:38.940]  then they opened fire and blew the school up killing even more kids to wipe out the two patsies
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:47.020]  they left inside the uh the uh the theater siege is a model of false flag it is indeed and the the
[03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:52.460]  chechens and the the russians have been running the chechens is their false flag operations just
[03:18:52.460 --> 03:18:57.500]  like we've been running the middle eastern muslims as our false flag operations in this country now
[03:18:57.500 --> 03:19:02.140]  they're kind of merging the two they're making it a worldwide war on terror this may have some
[03:19:02.140 --> 03:19:08.220]  other ramification in terms of bringing in more of this false propaganda that russia is our ally
[03:19:08.220 --> 03:19:13.740]  in the world on terror in the war on terror they're still planning a disarmament treaty
[03:19:13.740 --> 03:19:19.100]  another one yet again on russia even though they have yet to comply with the last new start treaty
[03:19:19.740 --> 03:19:24.540]  it seems like our government is just insisting on proving to the american p that the russians are
[03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:29.420]  our friends that there's no threat there that we're fighting a common terror enemy and this
[03:19:29.420 --> 03:19:34.620]  downplays the real threat which is russian china building weapons of mass destruction fully
[03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:41.420]  intending to strike the west someday when they're ready sure and i think still that we're economic
[03:19:41.420 --> 03:19:46.220]  collapse is not our major issue i think the powers that he can keep this going longer than we think
[03:19:46.220 --> 03:19:53.740]  but i think it's this mother of all terrorism a nuclear war on america that will someday be the
[03:19:53.740 --> 03:19:58.540]  biggest thing that will trigger not only martial law but a new world order all of the things that
[03:19:58.540 --> 03:20:05.100]  you've been predicting can be easily implemented under a nuclear attack scenario sure and they're
[03:20:05.100 --> 03:20:11.820]  creating under it all the foundation to launch it all uh once they have the proper uh trigger
[03:20:12.380 --> 03:20:17.500]  but i mean this is unprecedented we've had thousands of cases of lone gunmen that have shot
[03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:21.660]  or killed people before running around the loose and you don't shut down most of the whole city and
[03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:29.100]  then a surrounding another town by the city and it's just outrageous the test america failed
[03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:33.500]  uh going along with this and the cops having families come up with their hands up and then
[03:20:33.500 --> 03:20:40.300]  like grabbing women and shaking them and just you know like just crazy what is the mindset of these
[03:20:40.300 --> 03:20:46.060]  police i mean obviously the average cop does not know they're staging this stuff how have they
[03:20:46.060 --> 03:20:51.420]  gotten the cops to be to behave like this well you remember that they're they're training cops uh
[03:20:51.420 --> 03:20:56.220]  first of all there's a whole bunch of policemen involved in SWAT team operations we're trained to
[03:20:56.220 --> 03:21:01.740]  have this militaristic response to everything they use them regularly a lot of the police around them
[03:21:01.740 --> 03:21:06.540]  are watching and looking and admiring wonder when i can be a SWAT and so there's this mindset within
[03:21:06.540 --> 03:21:13.020]  police now that we want to emulate what the top brand police are doing as a SWAT team and when
[03:21:13.020 --> 03:21:18.940]  you had this kind of pseudo-patriotism involved with this boston marathon bomb everybody got
[03:21:18.940 --> 03:21:26.060]  hyped up and do acting this way and we saw it play out and so i'm really worried alex that we've got
[03:21:27.580 --> 03:21:32.700]  a growing atmosphere which allows a thuggish mentality to come out of placement and feel
[03:21:32.700 --> 03:21:40.380]  like it's justified when you have one of these super patriotic um you know terrorist attacks
[03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:44.620]  and that's why i say if you've got a nuclear attack on america someday you're going to see
[03:21:45.340 --> 03:21:50.860]  no holds barred everybody can be thrown in prison everybody can be anybody can be grabbed out of the
[03:21:50.860 --> 03:21:55.660]  house at will and nobody's even going to question it that's why it's important to understand that
[03:21:55.660 --> 03:22:03.740]  mentality what boston proved is that there's not going to be this kind of stated martial law
[03:22:03.740 --> 03:22:09.020]  without a major excuse it proves that with the proper excuse they don't even need to call martial
[03:22:09.020 --> 03:22:13.420]  law people just lay down and give up their rights well i've always said they're not going to call it
[03:22:13.420 --> 03:22:18.220]  martial law they're going to call it civil emergency public safety uh you know when police
[03:22:18.220 --> 03:22:22.300]  come to your house now i want to look at your guns and knock and talk they go it's just public safety
[03:22:22.940 --> 03:22:28.540]  and you know i think about what this country's turned into why do the powers that be want this
[03:22:28.540 --> 03:22:33.020]  power grid in place right now this control grid and it's because they are just going to
[03:22:33.020 --> 03:22:38.140]  incrementally dismantle this country and they're trying to make gun owners the enemy they're trying
[03:22:38.140 --> 03:22:42.940]  to put their cyber security system in place and of course they have that pull out saying 30 think
[03:22:42.940 --> 03:22:48.300]  you know 911 is an inside job or whatever i think that was a push poll uh you know done to make it
[03:22:48.300 --> 03:22:52.060]  look stupid because it was next to do you believe reptiles drink people's blood do you believe this
[03:22:52.060 --> 03:22:58.380]  and that from people when you talk to people privately more than half the people i run into
[03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:04.140]  uh and i've seen some polls showing over half believe that they're being lied to about 911
[03:23:04.140 --> 03:23:09.900]  most polls are around 90 believe jfk was was killed in a conspiracy so i really think this
[03:23:09.900 --> 03:23:17.740]  this whole police state response is a is a failing forward an attempt to try to overcompensate
[03:23:17.740 --> 03:23:22.380]  because the criminal clash the kleptocratic clash knows there's an awakening to them
[03:23:24.140 --> 03:23:28.780]  there really is and that's why as we've talked about on your previous shows there is this
[03:23:28.780 --> 03:23:34.220]  concept we need to always be aware of of them baiting uh people on the right as well to try
[03:23:34.220 --> 03:23:40.780]  to gain as much of a livid expression against government so that they can turn around and use
[03:23:40.780 --> 03:23:47.180]  that to justify coming after us but still i think it it takes something a major terrorist event like
[03:23:47.180 --> 03:23:53.420]  this or false flag terrorist event like this to justify what they want to do i don't think they
[03:23:53.420 --> 03:24:00.460]  could pull that off without something like this and again they've now bound patriotism to getting
[03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:06.300]  rid of the fourth amendment and having an orgy of police running around in paramilitary gear
[03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:13.660]  planting the flag of unconstitutional behavior on boston and then oh the fcc says you're allowed to
[03:24:13.660 --> 03:24:22.300]  cuss on tv if it's about boston now i mean it is just so comically obvious what they're rolling out
[03:24:22.300 --> 03:24:26.860]  and and uh you know you were on just like two weeks ago i think and i said i think a false flag's
[03:24:26.860 --> 03:24:35.900]  imminent you agreed because every cop show every drama every uh family guy you name it says the tea
[03:24:35.900 --> 03:24:42.780]  party will join al-qaeda and bomb america i mean every show every show uh that's a drama or a cop
[03:24:42.780 --> 03:24:48.220]  show uh does this uh you know even shows about remaking houses somehow injected into it because
[03:24:48.220 --> 03:24:54.140]  those aren't really real folks those are scripted as well they're quasi fiction uh quasi uh a
[03:24:54.140 --> 03:25:00.300]  non-fiction reality so it's the bathing in this and sure it's over the top now to say the founding
[03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:05.420]  fathers are scum and veterans are evil but when they're done with a bunch of bombings blaming it
[03:25:05.420 --> 03:25:10.140]  on us it will merge in the mind but i agree with you it looks like a five-year plan or something i
[03:25:10.140 --> 03:25:14.060]  think we may be a little bit closer than you think but um i want people to understand this is life
[03:25:14.060 --> 03:25:19.980]  and death that's why i work so hard and broadcast you know 18 hours a day some days last week with
[03:25:19.980 --> 03:25:24.780]  two hours sleep uh because you know the audience was there we had to talk to them is that this is
[03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:30.300]  so real i mean you're not you know people ask me alex are you serious about what you're saying
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:35.420]  look at history folks it's happening yes i'm serious joel talking to the enforcers the cops
[03:25:35.420 --> 03:25:40.220]  but then also people that might be patsies later talking directly to the enforcers out there i
[03:25:40.220 --> 03:25:44.940]  know we think they have low iq's and stuff because they're chosen for that but not all of them talk
[03:25:44.940 --> 03:25:49.260]  to them about about the choice they have to make and what they can do i think it's important to
[03:25:49.260 --> 03:25:57.660]  actually address the minions of this well my first call would be to people who are not really
[03:25:57.660 --> 03:26:03.740]  enforcers but people who are playing along with these for example there's probably 50 to 75
[03:26:03.740 --> 03:26:09.660]  explosives demolitions experts that load help load the world trade center the weekend before
[03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:14.700]  and previous to that when they had the drill to shut it down yeah that's right there there are
[03:26:14.700 --> 03:26:18.940]  hundreds of these people who are potential whistleblowers we need some of those people
[03:26:18.940 --> 03:26:22.860]  to come out and have the courage i know that you've been threatened to say you know what's
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:28.300]  going to happen to your family but you can see that this nation is on the brink of actually
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:35.180]  being controlled by a major black operation and it's it's much bigger than the two political
[03:26:35.180 --> 03:26:41.500]  parties it's it's above our governmental level and for the sake of whatever patriotism that
[03:26:41.500 --> 03:26:46.860]  you know you've grown up with you've got to come forward and talk about these things i know there's
[03:26:46.860 --> 03:26:52.860]  a tremendous pressure alex against these people to do so but you know we've had some like the
[03:26:52.860 --> 03:26:58.700]  shooters on the grass on grassy knoll we had two of them deathbed type confessions who were both
[03:26:58.700 --> 03:27:05.660]  in prison said they worked for the mafia and the cia both interchangeably on special operations
[03:27:05.660 --> 03:27:11.180]  like this they did shoot the president from the grassy knoll can we hear anything from the media
[03:27:11.180 --> 03:27:15.900]  that's the problem e howard hunt even went public and and even though he lost a lawsuit that
[03:27:15.900 --> 03:27:21.500]  claimed it by spotlight and confirmed he was a benchwarmer on the whole deal but with the kind
[03:27:21.500 --> 03:27:25.420]  but with the kind of audience that you've got alex the millions that listen to you you're a
[03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:31.900]  force to be reckoned with there is a way for whistleblowers to get this information out for
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:39.180]  example the aunt of jakarta narayev was threatened by the fbi that you will not talk to the media
[03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:46.700]  and so when this reporter from canada got to her and she told about the fact that the guy that they
[03:27:46.700 --> 03:27:52.220]  parroted around his naked was in fact tamarland that he was in fact alive and well and in a
[03:27:52.220 --> 03:27:57.900]  police car that's being suppressed it's very important and why would the fbi tell them to
[03:27:57.900 --> 03:28:02.380]  shut up i mean that's very guilty behavior by the way anybody wants to get a hold of us the tamarins
[03:28:04.300 --> 03:28:09.100]  or the family of tamarland you want to get a hold of his tips at info wars.com show tips
[03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:13.420]  and info wars.com go ahead and finish up i'm sorry there will be more coming out of that
[03:28:13.420 --> 03:28:17.180]  lady i'll tell you and from the parents they're going to have trouble shutting this up they're
[03:28:17.180 --> 03:28:21.820]  going to try but believe me these people are mad at the u.s government and they're going to tell
[03:28:21.820 --> 03:28:26.300]  more about the truth and i think there's a lot more to find we're going to be able to cover this
[03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:30.780]  story probably for the next six months you know i know you're putting together a big world affairs
[03:28:30.780 --> 03:28:34.140]  brief for friday but you're going to give us a boil down because i have to go to press in the
[03:28:34.140 --> 03:28:39.580]  next few days on the magazine the next month's issue that's going to have a you know a whole
[03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:46.860]  breakdown of false flags and a lot more so it's very important that this hard copy of the next
[03:28:46.860 --> 03:28:53.020]  month's issue have your boil down in it as well so you're going to get us that today and joel
[03:28:53.020 --> 03:28:57.100]  scowlson thank you so much we got one minute left for anything else you'd like to add i just want
[03:28:57.100 --> 03:29:02.780]  to let people know if they want to get a copy of that special synopsis of this briefing they can

[03:29:14.540 --> 03:29:21.580]  who are perennial conspiracy deniers or even glenn beck who's you know good guy considers himself
[03:29:21.580 --> 03:29:27.180]  a patriot but he's a conspiracy denier and it's a real problem you're at the forefront of this i'm
[03:29:27.180 --> 03:29:33.660]  at the forefront of this it's got to be said it won't it's not changing political parties it's not
[03:29:33.660 --> 03:29:38.700]  electing republicans or even getting rid of obama that will solve the situation it is exposing the
[03:29:38.700 --> 03:29:44.380]  fact that we have a secret combination of power that controls all the levels of power at least
[03:29:44.380 --> 03:29:48.940]  they have effective control and we've got to kill that we've got to fight against it that's right
[03:29:48.940 --> 03:29:53.820]  they're not in full control yet and can't bar the door if they get it we're in a real struggle thank

[03:33:36.460 --> 03:33:42.540]  people have been waiting for a very long time uh jakari how you doing any thoughts oh i'm doing
[03:33:42.540 --> 03:33:47.260]  fine my uh thoughts and prayers are still with the people of boston uh not just you know for
[03:33:47.260 --> 03:33:52.140]  the bombing but for the traumatic uh incident of you know having the the SWAT teams come and throw
[03:33:52.140 --> 03:33:56.940]  you out of your own home absolutely i just shut down the city to catch one kid i mean how many
[03:33:56.940 --> 03:34:01.740]  drug dealers and uh car thieves violent car thieves are out there every day doing that thing
[03:34:01.740 --> 03:34:06.220]  which you had to shut down the city to catch uh one guy absolutely that's just amazing i've never
[03:34:06.220 --> 03:34:09.260]  seen anything like it i don't think anybody's seen anything like that before in america but
[03:34:09.260 --> 03:34:14.540]  unfortunately it looks like they're going to use that as a template and they're going to do that
[03:34:14.540 --> 03:34:18.300]  more and more we're going to see that if unless we stop it you know people just have to stand up
[03:34:18.300 --> 03:34:24.220]  and stop it you know we're talking about cispa that uh there's a campaign today uh anonymous
[03:34:24.220 --> 03:34:28.540]  other people on the on twitter are trying to raise awareness of this because it is very close to
[03:34:28.540 --> 03:34:34.780]  passing and it is what the late aaron schwartz called the patriot act of the internet and he
[03:34:34.780 --> 03:34:38.620]  was really kind of a paul revere he didn't want to take credit for this but he woke a lot of people
[03:34:38.620 --> 03:34:43.580]  up but he was right in the sense that it wasn't anything that one person could do but he could
[03:34:43.580 --> 03:34:49.740]  get people upset about it and they just uh they hit congress with so many so much information so
[03:34:49.740 --> 03:34:56.380]  many um protests that congress basically backed off you know if if the public is like a sleeping
[03:34:56.380 --> 03:35:00.540]  giant and if they stay asleep the government's going to come by and they're going to solely
[03:35:00.540 --> 03:35:03.660]  amputate you know it's like a like diabetes or something you're going to lose a finger you're
[03:35:03.660 --> 03:35:07.020]  going to lose an arm you're going to lose a leg until you can't do anything anymore until you're
[03:35:07.020 --> 03:35:12.060]  dead but if we wake up they back off we've seen that over and over again we saw it with the second
[03:35:12.060 --> 03:35:15.980]  amendment and we've got to get people who were fired up on the second amendment issue just as
[03:35:15.980 --> 03:35:21.500]  fired up on this patriot act uh for the internet cispa that's going to be stopped with guys like
[03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:27.740]  dan bedani i mean just one guy shut down three press conferences because he dared to uh desire
[03:35:27.740 --> 03:35:32.620]  the truth absolutely he had more people like that at congress at senate at the the city council
[03:35:32.620 --> 03:35:37.100]  meetings at the whatever who will go out there and just make their voices known because don't
[03:35:37.100 --> 03:35:41.100]  assume somebody's going to do this for you don't assume that your neighbor is going to write your
[03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:46.220]  congressman or email your senator make make sure that you do these things yourself like i gave the
[03:35:46.220 --> 03:35:51.500]  example how i uh i called chuckie schumer's office when he compared a private gun sellers to child
[03:35:51.500 --> 03:35:55.180]  pornographers i called chuckie schumer's office i didn't get to talk to him i had to talk to his
[03:35:55.180 --> 03:35:58.860]  intern but i made my voice known and that's the same thing people have to do on these other issues
[03:35:58.860 --> 03:36:03.180]  like cispa absolutely and you know it wasn't just shutting down those press conferences what dan
[03:36:03.180 --> 03:36:07.740]  did was he made the term false flag part of the national dialogue on this and that's real important
[03:36:07.740 --> 03:36:13.260]  because people have to see these things in the context of what's happened before and if you go
[03:36:13.260 --> 03:36:17.980]  back and look on the internet at the comments that aaron schwartz made when he was talking to
[03:36:17.980 --> 03:36:23.900]  people about these internet uh attack these attacks on internet privacy it was a real
[03:36:23.900 --> 03:36:28.940]  awakening for him to see the attitude and the power trips of these congressmen but let's go
[03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:33.180]  to some of these calls that we've got right now i think the first one that we got up is uh is that
[03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:40.780]  uh dave and arizona is that the first one we've got dave are you there hello dave
[03:36:40.780 --> 03:36:50.540]  dave dave and arizona okay let's go to another one right here um we've got dc and west virginia
[03:36:51.660 --> 03:36:58.860]  hey what's going on guys hey man this is this is huge especially for somebody that's awake now
[03:36:58.860 --> 03:37:03.900]  that wasn't awake for 9 11 it's just a whole on a whole nother level seeing everything that's
[03:37:03.900 --> 03:37:08.380]  going on being awake as of 9 11 happening and then waking up you know what i mean
[03:37:08.380 --> 03:37:14.060]  yeah but um i think a big thing that's being missed um not by you all but like other people
[03:37:14.060 --> 03:37:20.940]  is the ndaa i feel like one of the big agendas of this false flag is to kind of legitimize ndaa
[03:37:20.940 --> 03:37:26.220]  kind of the way 9 11 did the patriarch absolutely and you saw the supporters the big supporters of
[03:37:26.220 --> 03:37:30.780]  ndaa lindsey graham out there saying that we've got to give this guy the full getmo treatment call
[03:37:30.780 --> 03:37:35.100]  him an enemy combatant yeah you don't get a lawyer you're an enemy combatant that's the thing that
[03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:39.980]  really bothered me with the way this thing has been handled since uh the guy's apprehension
[03:37:39.980 --> 03:37:44.940]  is all you see on your big mainstream networks is we don't have time to give this guy his miranda
[03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:48.460]  rights we don't need warrants to arrest and absolutely we don't even have to show you this
[03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:53.900]  guy placing the bomb i mean you can see these guys uh walking around you know just you know fair and
[03:37:53.900 --> 03:37:58.060]  easy all day but you can't see these guys ever placing any charges down now carney did have a
[03:37:58.060 --> 03:38:02.460]  press conference today and he did say that he's going to uh that they are not that they are going
[03:38:02.460 --> 03:38:07.980]  to give them a regular judicial process that remains to be seen i guess the real question is
[03:38:07.980 --> 03:38:15.180]  the apprehension of these two suspects uh the fact that the aunt is saying that uh this one guy
[03:38:15.180 --> 03:38:20.380]  was uh the nate the older brother was in fact the video that we have of the naked suspect being
[03:38:20.380 --> 03:38:26.940]  taken and then the next thing you see he's dead and then we see that the uh younger brother is
[03:38:26.940 --> 03:38:31.260]  hiding in the boat and the boat is just riddled with bullets like bonnie and clyd right and then
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:37.500]  he appears to be let away walking fine and then the next thing we know he's nearly dead bleeding
[03:38:37.500 --> 03:38:43.980]  from the yeah yeah so there's some real questions about that as alex mentioned uh there was uh
[03:38:43.980 --> 03:38:48.060]  chatter on the police radio saying that oh no the press is here in other words they did not
[03:38:48.060 --> 03:38:53.340]  want anybody covering these but um anything else you wanted to add yeah speaking of that boat
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:57.980]  incident i mean for one night storyline couldn't write something better than this this is crazy
[03:38:57.980 --> 03:39:02.540]  but i don't know if you guys have seen the internet pictures right now that show him
[03:39:02.540 --> 03:39:07.260]  kind of crawling out of the boat when they apprehended him i mean i'm curious as well
[03:39:07.260 --> 03:39:10.620]  we can get somebody to see if that's what's doing it because i mean that's just how are you going
[03:39:10.620 --> 03:39:15.100]  to crawl out of the boat after they literally bullets for one and for two and you guys noticed
[03:39:15.100 --> 03:39:19.420]  how when it first happened they kept asking the media would ask about what whether or not he had
[03:39:19.420 --> 03:39:23.420]  a gun and it kind of still they brought that up and he kind of stumbled over what he was going to
[03:39:23.420 --> 03:39:26.620]  say and kind of wanted to end it right there like he didn't know he didn't want to talk about that
[03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:31.260]  stuff well if you remember sir the uh the big lie well i won't say the lie but the thing they
[03:39:31.260 --> 03:39:36.220]  were trying to push is the fact that he was probably armed likely armed with a uh explosive
[03:39:36.220 --> 03:39:40.780]  vest a suicide vest is the thing they kept trying to push so we have to take this guy out we can't
[03:39:40.780 --> 03:39:45.740]  take any chances we don't need any warrants because he may be strapped with a suicide vest
[03:39:45.740 --> 03:39:51.260]  well and as joel scousen pointed out when we listen to the tapes you hear a tremendous amount
[03:39:51.260 --> 03:39:56.380]  of gunfire i and i've listened to the tapes that uh neighbors made i didn't see or hear any
[03:39:56.380 --> 03:40:02.300]  explosions uh so the tapes really don't corroborate what the fbi is saying at this point as far as
[03:40:02.300 --> 03:40:07.820]  there being uh explosions and bombs being thrown well thanks for talking to us uh we've got michael
[03:40:07.820 --> 03:40:15.020]  in tennessee coming up next michael you there hello hello michael hello can you hear us how are
[03:40:15.020 --> 03:40:21.660]  you today doing fine what you got uh i'm a planet president uh excuse me prison planet member
[03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:28.300]  calling from fema region four uh i've got y'all's free bumper stickers and passing them out like
[03:40:28.300 --> 03:40:36.300]  water i use your broker all of a sudden anyway i called alex about a month ago um the constitution
[03:40:36.300 --> 03:40:41.900]  bill of rights news ticker idea guy i think y'all should run the bill of rights as a news sticker
[03:40:41.900 --> 03:40:47.740]  uh at the bottom of your screen uh but i wanted to point out something about the constitution
[03:40:47.740 --> 03:40:52.780]  everybody's trying to mess with it and i'm going to tell you the bill of rights itself says in the
[03:40:52.780 --> 03:40:58.380]  first four articles the first letter of all of the first four articles spells out the words can't i
[03:40:58.380 --> 03:41:04.620]  think it can't be any uh plainer than that i'd also like to point out that the milestone stones
[03:41:04.620 --> 03:41:11.340]  to our road to freedom should include wonderful things like badandi's awesome non-mainstream
[03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:18.860]  questioning and all of also alex's pierce morgan takeover show um i'm gonna say i think it's
[03:41:18.860 --> 03:41:23.340]  unusual that the twin towers and they're originally recalling this the twin bombings
[03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:30.780]  and i'd just like to know if you think there were any videos that showed video dogs uh those uh bomb
[03:41:30.780 --> 03:41:37.740]  sniffing dogs uh that were actually alerted and then kind of asked to turn down and there are
[03:41:37.740 --> 03:41:42.460]  people all the time i'm saying a lot of stuff here but i want to get it out and then you can comment
[03:41:42.460 --> 03:41:46.860]  but uh people say all the time what can i do well i in about the last two months have become
[03:41:46.860 --> 03:41:54.380]  extremely proactive and i've called on my phone 93 calls to senators and state representatives
[03:41:54.380 --> 03:42:00.460]  against unlawful gun controls and for teachers to be trained which by the way in tennessee passed
[03:42:00.460 --> 03:42:05.820]  and are there any websites that show any information about dr botanics reporting on the
[03:42:05.820 --> 03:42:11.500]  obama bush quentin uh indictments and now i'll leave it to you and that's all i wanted to ask
[03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:15.740]  it was pulled down as addressing the uh the pachinik question that was pulled down but i
[03:42:15.740 --> 03:42:22.140]  do believe it is on planet infowars and uh you can probably just uh type in the search uh and
[03:42:22.140 --> 03:42:26.860]  i don't remember the name of the website but uh they did have a one-hour video there press
[03:42:26.860 --> 03:42:31.660]  conference and you can look at the full 600 page report that organization and i don't have that
[03:42:31.660 --> 03:42:35.740]  right with me right now maybe we get that uh later but i tell you what michael i really
[03:42:35.740 --> 03:42:41.020]  appreciate your activism and your support of us but your activism with congress and one thing
[03:42:41.020 --> 03:42:46.460]  to put on your list you've been very active calling people call about cispa that is something
[03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:50.140]  there's a lot more republican support for it than there is democrat support so we still have
[03:42:50.140 --> 03:42:55.340]  a chance at defeating it in the senate right and we've got to remember that sopa and pipa
[03:42:55.340 --> 03:43:00.940]  and even cispa itself in its previous incarnation that wasn't as bad as it is right now those
[03:43:00.940 --> 03:43:07.340]  were all defeated even though all of the people on the house committee were co-sponsors of it
[03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:11.260]  it was pretty much a done deal when aaron schwartz started fighting it and they brought that thing
[03:43:11.260 --> 03:43:15.900]  back they delayed it and they brought it you know kept publicizing it and resisting it until they
[03:43:15.900 --> 03:43:20.620]  stopped it so it can be stopped but we have to get active just like you've been active
[03:43:20.620 --> 03:43:25.580]  and in terms of the number of videos and things that are going to show any bomb sniffing dogs at
[03:43:25.580 --> 03:43:30.380]  the finish line i think we're going to see a lot of stuff continue to surface over the next
[03:43:30.380 --> 03:43:36.460]  next months and years you got to remember that we just talked to mike mcnulty who did the
[03:43:37.260 --> 03:43:44.860]  waco rules of engagement and then waco a new revelation documentary and it took a long time
[03:43:44.860 --> 03:43:50.700]  for the information about exactly what happened at waco people knew that the official story was
[03:43:50.700 --> 03:43:57.180]  contrived false contradictory but it took a very long time to find the exact information and it
[03:43:57.180 --> 03:44:01.180]  took him a while to discover it and he actually was successful freedom of information act to
[03:44:01.180 --> 03:44:05.820]  uncover some information that the government had never had out there before so i think eventually
[03:44:05.820 --> 03:44:09.900]  the truth is going to come out we know though from the get-go that there's a lot of suspicious stuff
[03:44:09.900 --> 03:44:15.340]  here and keep in mind a lot of people have their cameras and such confiscated by the authorities
[03:44:15.340 --> 03:44:18.780]  when it happened they even admitted that on cnn we have to take these cameras because there may
[03:44:18.780 --> 03:44:24.060]  be information on them so that will make it somewhat more difficult but i am confident
[03:44:24.060 --> 03:44:28.860]  there are people who have uh even if it's just in the background they have the bomb sniffing dogs or
[03:44:28.860 --> 03:44:33.660]  whatever else going on absolutely we've got terry in washington next terry are you there
[03:44:34.700 --> 03:44:40.700]  i'm here hey how you guys doing doing fine how are you what you got good hey i hope alex is still
[03:44:40.700 --> 03:44:46.220]  in the building because i want him to hear this i tell you what it it sucks it for anybody that
[03:44:46.220 --> 03:44:54.140]  doesn't belong to prison planet.tv because i i watched this unfold the day that alex had richard
[03:44:54.140 --> 03:45:03.100]  belzer on the on the on the show that's right and the first thing that came to my mind i've never
[03:45:03.100 --> 03:45:10.700]  seen a telethon or a marathon where they didn't have a camera up high watching the runners come
[03:45:10.700 --> 03:45:16.380]  in that's a very good point yeah that camera was covered up because it was in it was in the spot
[03:45:16.380 --> 03:45:24.940]  where the bomb was to go off yeah and they knew that ahead of time yeah it was either also i want
[03:45:24.940 --> 03:45:29.900]  to see the dash cam of these guys throwing bombs out the window yes that's exactly what i said i
[03:45:29.900 --> 03:45:34.620]  want to see the dash cam of the bombs being thrown out i want to see the dash cam of the younger
[03:45:34.620 --> 03:45:38.940]  brother running over the other brother i mean they should have all this stuff on tape somewhere
[03:45:38.940 --> 03:45:42.220]  well even going back further than that you remember when they finally did get around to
[03:45:42.220 --> 03:45:47.820]  their press conference that they delayed and then delayed again as we're releasing photographs they
[03:45:47.820 --> 03:45:52.540]  were telling people don't look at any of the other photographs but in their own uh what they were
[03:45:52.540 --> 03:45:57.660]  telling us to look at it really wasn't very credible i mean he had the wrong color backpack
[03:45:57.660 --> 03:46:03.740]  the younger brother has a very casual attitude as he's walking along and uh it just it just didn't
[03:46:03.740 --> 03:46:09.420]  make any sense you know when they had it and at the press conference you had a reporter ask the
[03:46:09.420 --> 03:46:15.820]  fbi uh representative what time it was put down and he was kind of vague on that well it was
[03:46:15.820 --> 03:46:19.580]  sometime around you know close to when the explosion happened do you have a picture of
[03:46:19.580 --> 03:46:24.540]  the bag being put down no no they didn't have you know or they weren't releasing it so why haven't
[03:46:24.540 --> 03:46:29.100]  we seen a picture of the bag being put down i mean they keep showing this picture of the two uh
[03:46:29.100 --> 03:46:33.500]  brothers walking around the corner of a building and a couple of feet down a sidewalk and that's
[03:46:33.500 --> 03:46:38.220]  it and yet we're supposed to take wrong color with the wrong color bag and yet that's conclusive
[03:46:38.220 --> 03:46:42.700]  evidence that these guys did the bombing and and the press is reporting this as the guys who did
[03:46:42.700 --> 03:46:47.340]  the bombing they're not even using the word alleged yeah and as far as the evidence let's
[03:46:47.340 --> 03:46:53.100]  find out who this naked man was because there is speculation the aunt i believe has identified the
[03:46:53.100 --> 03:46:58.140]  naked man as one of her relatives and yes as the older brother but you're not talking about that
[03:46:58.140 --> 03:47:02.540]  anymore it came out on uh i think believe it was cnn a few days ago and it hasn't been talked about
[03:47:02.540 --> 03:47:07.100]  since as far as i know that's right mike did you have anything else it's just like i was watching
[03:47:07.100 --> 03:47:13.660]  cnn this morning wait for alex to come on and you know they were interviewing these guys and every
[03:47:13.660 --> 03:47:20.620]  everybody that they interviewed kept passing the buck you know that wasn't my department and you
[03:47:20.620 --> 03:47:25.660]  know that was a different district and uh they had a long rifle and of course they had to bring
[03:47:25.660 --> 03:47:32.060]  the long rifle into the scene there's a long rifle in the car you know it's just it's just so full of
[03:47:32.060 --> 03:47:37.740]  holes that this thing isn't gonna float the fact it's gonna float about as good as that boat
[03:47:38.380 --> 03:47:43.980]  absolutely but you you say that they've got their uh their their agenda coming out already
[03:47:43.980 --> 03:47:49.740]  uh last thursday when the house had the cispa act you had the uh chair of the house committee on
[03:47:49.740 --> 03:47:54.060]  homeland security saying well we had real bombs now but the digital bombs are coming so we've
[03:47:54.060 --> 03:48:00.540]  got to pass cispa then you've got uh the guy who was a co-sponsor of cispa coming on and talking
[03:48:00.540 --> 03:48:05.500]  yesterday uh about uh all these dangers and everything how this has got to be put in so
[03:48:05.500 --> 03:48:10.940]  they've got an agenda they even tried to tie this into other firearms you know say these guys didn't
[03:48:10.940 --> 03:48:15.500]  have the proper licenses for their handguns so therefore we've got to have uh you know more
[03:48:15.500 --> 03:48:20.940]  licenses i guess we're going to have uh pressure cookers banned next and uh black powder for making
[03:48:20.940 --> 03:48:26.300]  uh ammunition oh yeah that's a that's a real yeah this is the thing too absolutely well thank you
[03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:31.900]  mike we have to move on to uh let's go to david in alaska david are you there can you hear me
[03:48:32.540 --> 03:48:39.900]  yes yes uh yes i got a question uh maybe you could help quote either the in the constitution
[03:48:39.900 --> 03:48:45.180]  or in the declaration of independence now i could be wrong i don't know which one it's in
[03:48:45.180 --> 03:48:53.900]  but i know that it's been written and set in stone saying we are being able to bear arms
[03:48:53.900 --> 03:49:00.780]  for the reason that if in case one day the government gets too big and too controlling
[03:49:00.780 --> 03:49:10.380]  and tyrannical that we are obligated as our u.s citizen right to to form a militia to fight back
[03:49:10.380 --> 03:49:17.660]  to reach to regain well the uh declaration of independence you know they always have you uh
[03:49:17.660 --> 03:49:22.220]  memorize in school the part of that these rights are inalienable rights okay and that
[03:49:22.220 --> 03:49:26.540]  but they don't have you uh memorize the second half of that first paragraph which says that when
[03:49:26.540 --> 03:49:32.220]  a government uh is destructive of these rights it is the right of the duty the right and the duty
[03:49:32.220 --> 03:49:37.660]  of the people to alter or abolish that government they don't want you to memorize that part of it
[03:49:37.660 --> 03:49:41.820]  but when you talk about the constitution really the militia and the second amendment comes in in
[03:49:41.820 --> 03:49:46.540]  two places it's not just the second amendment but it was also in article one section eight and what
[03:49:46.540 --> 03:49:52.620]  it said there was that the federal government would not organize an army and fund it for more
[03:49:52.620 --> 03:49:57.980]  than two years at a time they were allowed to organize and fund permanently a navy to protect
[03:49:57.980 --> 03:50:02.460]  our borders and protect us from invasion but they understood that a standing army and if you look at
[03:50:02.460 --> 03:50:06.140]  the federalist papers and the debates on the constitution you'll see that they understood
[03:50:06.140 --> 03:50:11.100]  that a standing army would eventually be used as an instrument of oppression they had already
[03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:15.100]  experienced that from the british and they knew that that would happen again and so they
[03:50:15.100 --> 03:50:20.300]  knew that that would happen again and so they did not want a permanent standing army and you can see
[03:50:20.300 --> 03:50:25.820]  that in the farewell address of eisenhower that he was very concerned about that about a permanent
[03:50:25.820 --> 03:50:31.660]  military industrial complex and how that was going to be run for profit so that's something that is
[03:50:31.660 --> 03:50:38.140]  really kind of came into play after world war ii we've had a constant standing army and it's been
[03:50:38.140 --> 03:50:43.100]  involved in constant war ever since then and and now that war is coming home now that military
[03:50:43.100 --> 03:50:49.580]  industrial complex is starting to fund itself with domestic operations and we're going to see
[03:50:49.580 --> 03:51:02.940]  that happen we'll be right back in just a few minutes we're going to take some more calls
[03:51:02.940 --> 03:51:14.940]  in the last two years alone the us has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and

[03:54:23.260 --> 03:54:29.180]  taking your calls and let's go right to mike in california mike had we talked to you before or
[03:54:29.180 --> 03:54:34.860]  is this a different mike in california uh this is a different mike okay how you doing oh good hey
[03:54:34.860 --> 03:54:39.740]  first of all you guys are playing some great music for the intro thanks but uh i just want to say i
[03:54:39.740 --> 03:54:45.740]  i caught something in the fbi press conference uh after they caught the suspect uh reporter asked
[03:54:45.740 --> 03:54:51.100]  how did the suspect get away and they said he got away on foot so if he got away on foot then how is
[03:54:51.100 --> 03:54:56.700]  it possible that he also ran over his brother trying to get away yeah that that was real iffy
[03:54:56.700 --> 03:55:00.540]  to me because there is speculation that maybe he was driving and then hopped out the car then
[03:55:00.540 --> 03:55:06.620]  proceeding on foot but even if he did proceed on foot i mean with that many officers around i mean
[03:55:06.620 --> 03:55:10.860]  the dragnet of that i'm just not sure how he could get away with that many officers around him
[03:55:10.860 --> 03:55:15.180]  especially if they had any type of helicopter coverage yeah and even with the house-to-house
[03:55:15.180 --> 03:55:18.940]  gestapo tactics that they were doing you know pulling people out of their houses at gunpoint
[03:55:18.940 --> 03:55:23.740]  they didn't find him yeah it was the guy said hey i think there's somebody in my boat you know
[03:55:23.740 --> 03:55:27.820]  he turned him in i mean it's citizens who found him right anything else you wanted to say mike
[03:55:28.700 --> 03:55:33.100]  yeah yeah uh well first of all they were also already engaged in a firefight so i don't see
[03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:39.580]  the guy getting away without being shot but also i'm wondering oh michelle obama has no official
[03:55:39.580 --> 03:55:45.660]  capacity whatsoever she's not elected she has no authority whatsoever what right did she have to
[03:55:45.660 --> 03:55:52.380]  go in there and see somebody that was a person of interest in a massive terrorist plot without you
[03:55:52.380 --> 03:55:57.660]  know how does she get in through the back door into the hospital like this well she you know
[03:55:57.660 --> 03:56:01.900]  it's just a photo op and you know something to talk about just like he says he has no elected
[03:56:01.900 --> 03:56:07.660]  office he's you know the wife of the president yeah yeah absolutely well thank you mike appreciate
[03:56:07.660 --> 03:56:15.660]  it let's go to josh and georgia josh are you there hey there hey how are you hi what you got
[03:56:15.660 --> 03:56:25.100]  um well uh uh i've been better yeah been for the last week or uh just it's horrible uh but
[03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:32.140]  so what i wanted to do is uh kind of uh plug here i've got a uh page on uh facebook that i started
[03:56:32.140 --> 03:56:38.620]  in a group and it's called the name of it is the constitution is alive granted i know it's not a
[03:56:38.620 --> 03:56:45.100]  living document but if if the constitution dies so does this country is the the idea that i was
[03:56:45.100 --> 03:56:53.500]  going with um also email it at hotmail the same name um and what it is uh i'm trying i've been
[03:56:53.500 --> 03:56:58.860]  getting in contact with uh various national and local groups as well as trying to contact um
[03:56:58.860 --> 03:57:10.860]  uh senators and legislators uh about uh having a national rally on july 4th uh i feel that that
[03:57:10.860 --> 03:57:17.420]  that date will send an even greater message than you know some any other day of the year especially
[03:57:17.420 --> 03:57:23.660]  for this nation uh for us to march on our state capitals i feel that uh if you can make it to
[03:57:23.660 --> 03:57:29.900]  washington that that'll be great but uh if you can't can't make the cross-country trek uh state
[03:57:29.900 --> 03:57:37.260]  capitals of work uh for gun owners across america to finally stand up and and to have our voice be
[03:57:37.260 --> 03:57:42.540]  heard where we can absolutely and your voice is going to be heard better at the state level than
[03:57:42.540 --> 03:57:47.980]  it is at the federal level i mean we've seen that over and over again there are some legislators at
[03:57:47.980 --> 03:57:54.300]  the state level we have some people here in texas who are trying to fight uh the tsa's uh
[03:57:54.300 --> 03:57:59.500]  overreaching violation of the fourth amendment and uh other things and and so you do have some
[03:57:59.500 --> 03:58:04.700]  people who are pushing back against federal usurpation of power and overreach and they're
[03:58:04.700 --> 03:58:08.620]  at the state level so you need to really get involved there and support those people
[03:58:08.620 --> 03:58:16.700]  and then i have been uh i haven't haven't really gotten any uh any feedback uh from uh from anybody
[03:58:16.700 --> 03:58:23.980]  uh any politically wise uh yet but um we'll keep trying and tell people on your facebook page to
