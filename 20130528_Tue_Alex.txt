[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.720 --> 00:31.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.500]  The ruling class that controls much of this club through fraud and disinformation prays
[00:37.500 --> 00:43.640]  every day that you be ignorant, that you be stupid, that you be so self-centered that
[00:43.640 --> 00:46.880]  you don't even care about what's happening in society to the point of where you will
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.800]  actually be enslaved and most probably destroyed.
[00:52.800 --> 01:01.560]  They absolutely swim in the ether that is the ignorance gripping our world. I look at
[01:01.560 --> 01:08.480]  the headlines where the former MI5 chief says, the enemy is everywhere, watch your neighbors,
[01:08.480 --> 01:14.800]  extremists are everywhere. And then they segue into nationalist right wing patriot groups.
[01:14.800 --> 01:22.640]  See, they use the radical Muslims that they protect and shepherd and fund as the overall
[01:22.640 --> 01:25.340]  backdrop for the global war on terror.
[01:25.340 --> 01:29.240]  But then meanwhile, it's really pointed at people that know the criminal governments
[01:29.240 --> 01:35.680]  of the West are the big issue. And that's hiding in plain view. Here in the United States,
[01:35.680 --> 01:41.320]  they're saying, brace for terrorists everywhere. By the way, they're tea partiers and conservatives
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.440]  and veterans and gun owners and libertarians and constitutionalist.
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.960]  And it's the same thing over in the UK, same thing in Europe. But then meanwhile, John
[01:52.960 --> 02:02.600]  McCain, if you believe it, snuck across with a quote, US force out of Turkey into Syria
[02:02.600 --> 02:08.080]  to discuss giving arms to the rebels and then met with a bunch of Osama bin Laden, Qatari
[02:08.080 --> 02:22.520]  and Saudi Arabian Wahhabist. I mean, there he is with a bunch of bin Laden lookalikes
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.040]  with real al-Qaeda, with the al-Qaeda brigade.
[02:25.040 --> 02:31.160]  It's actually called the bin Laden brigade that leads the Syrian forces. But when you
[02:31.160 --> 02:35.600]  fly, and there's new videos on infoawars.com, and you don't wanna go through the radiation
[02:35.600 --> 02:43.960]  machine to make sure you don't have a bomb on you. They're gonna need to look inside
[02:43.960 --> 02:46.840]  you, well, you know what South Park says, and it's actually true.
[02:46.840 --> 02:53.140]  It's all an act of domination to get their filthy government bureaucratic hands on you.
[02:53.140 --> 02:59.640]  And even the idiots doing it don't even know why they've been hired to do this. Meanwhile,
[02:59.640 --> 03:09.480]  Rand Paul is telling it like it is. He's come out and said properly that our government
[03:09.480 --> 03:19.880]  and the US Senate is arming al-Qaeda. But if you try to talk to the general public who's
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.880]  not informed about this, they go, listen to that, he knows how to talk.
[03:25.880 --> 03:31.800]  He's trying to show off to us. He says the government runs al-Qaeda. Rand Paul's Senate
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.760]  is arming al-Qaeda and rushing to war in Syria. That was last Friday, got almost no attention.
[03:37.760 --> 03:47.040]  Said that on the floor of the Senate. And that is a fact. That is a fact. And I just
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.680]  sit here, and I guarantee you, if I say to TSA, hey, this whole terror threat's fake.
[03:52.680 --> 04:02.040]  The government runs al-Qaeda. Yeah, right, just listen to you. Right out of videocracy,
[04:02.040 --> 04:13.600]  and it's a fact, an oxymoron, a fraudulent, raging paradox hanging in front of our faces.
[04:13.600 --> 04:19.240]  And now you've got multiple FBI agents involved in the so-called investigation of the Boston
[04:19.240 --> 04:24.320]  bombing dead. You've got more Navy SEALs and SEAL Team 6 dying, constantly falling out
[04:24.320 --> 04:30.120]  of helicopters, being run over, being shot, being assassinated. Covering up the Bin Laden
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.600]  hoax, the killing of Bin Laden. Covering up what really happened to the Boston bombing.
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.680]  I mean, they are so desperate in the Boston bombing that the media not look at it, just
[04:40.680 --> 04:42.280]  acting completely suspicious.
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.960]  It'd be like if a cop drove by and somebody, Solomon, ran into the woods. The cop would
[04:47.960 --> 04:53.800]  say, well, that looks like a reasonable suspicion of something here. The government acts totally
[04:53.800 --> 05:00.000]  creepy, totally suspicious, and then publicly commits massive crimes everywhere.

[06:59.760 --> 07:04.840]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[07:04.840 --> 07:09.480]  good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.740]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[07:13.740 --> 07:19.140]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[07:19.140 --> 07:24.440]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[07:24.440 --> 07:30.000]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[09:07.020 --> 09:09.720]  Twitter and so much more.
[09:09.720 --> 09:17.340]  Okay, wow where to begin? John McCain we're going to cover this today obviously secretly
[09:17.340 --> 09:24.420]  went to Turkey the big NATO command base and infiltrated into Syria if you even believe
[09:24.420 --> 09:31.780]  that in a grandstanding event and met with the leaders of Al-Qaeda as part of flaunting
[09:31.780 --> 09:38.560]  in the American people's comatose face that they are heroes and need heavy weapons. And
[09:38.560 --> 09:44.960]  then our so-called press then goes how dare Obama not have a full-blown war when there
[09:44.960 --> 09:49.960]  is a full-blown war and then that gives him left cover where even Obama in a two plus
[09:49.960 --> 09:57.000]  year bombardment, bombing, artillery attacks, fighter bomber attacks, 60,000 trips every
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.960]  few months rotated in and out at least that's a conservative number 120,000 Syrians dead
[10:03.960 --> 10:10.960]  war of aggression and they have the neocon chicken hawks running up and down saying how
[10:10.960 --> 10:17.440]  dare Obama the commie, how about the new world order right, their buddy and these people
[10:17.440 --> 10:22.600]  are all hanging out together behind the scenes at that level of leadership ladies and gentlemen
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.680]  can then criticize him for not doing enough.
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.920]  And McCain literally sneaks across and met with the opposition leaders and I saw video
[10:33.920 --> 10:37.480]  and photos of this and I'm going to cover it coming up later in the hour. It was so
[10:37.480 --> 10:46.000]  degenerate with the so-called rebel leaders slouched like gang members in their chairs
[10:46.000 --> 10:56.600]  in a conference room in a captured city council totally and completely disgusting.
[10:56.600 --> 11:02.240]  I'm sitting around the council room saying we are not happy with your government not
[11:02.240 --> 11:08.240]  giving us aid which is all a set piece to go we're not giving the darlings aid to fight
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.440]  the Muslim extremist our public is so dumbed down. I've heard them I know you've heard
[11:12.440 --> 11:18.880]  them on talk radio go we need to fight al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria when our criminal banker
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.460]  occupied government are the ones putting al-Qaeda in and then using al-Qaeda is the menacing
[11:24.460 --> 11:30.220]  threat to take our liberties set up a homeland security spy grid which in all the training
[11:30.220 --> 11:36.480]  manuals has nothing to do with Muslim extremist it has to do with you and your farm and your
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.740]  ranch or your business and your guns and your children and how they're going to forcibly
[11:41.740 --> 11:43.760]  inoculate you.
[11:43.760 --> 11:50.200]  It is the social engineer control freak nanny state that wants in your life all over the
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.440]  globalist controlled world that's every country but about 10 they've almost got global government
[11:55.440 --> 11:59.000]  in they haven't mopped up state governments within governments they haven't shut down
[11:59.000 --> 12:10.320]  all the free press here and there but they're very close and the goal is run your life the
[12:10.320 --> 12:17.480]  goal is control your life the goal is dominate you and your family that's why the exact same
[12:17.480 --> 12:24.080]  programs you see in Germany are in Australia are in the United States are in England are
[12:24.080 --> 12:33.200]  in Canada are in Wales are in Scotland are in Mexico because the globalist control the
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.600]  issuance of currency and credit and coming up in the next hour I'm going to spend some
[12:36.600 --> 12:44.560]  time on this Scotland every child to have state guardian from birth that spies on the
[12:44.560 --> 12:49.880]  parents and the trains the child that the state is their parent and trains the child
[12:49.880 --> 12:56.080]  to report on their parents this is what Communist China did when Mao took over this is the standard
[12:56.080 --> 13:00.200]  program and of course who is seven times more likely to abuse a child in any other group
[13:00.200 --> 13:06.160]  worldwide government who gets into this type of work because they like to abuse children
[13:06.160 --> 13:14.360]  you know who God help us and then if you're actually poor and your kids are running around
[13:14.360 --> 13:17.480]  you know drinking sewage water in a third world country the globalist aren't there aren't
[13:17.480 --> 13:24.880]  any social workers but if it's in the West they target Christians libertarians conservatives
[13:24.880 --> 13:31.000]  God owners people that have shining eye children who aren't eating GMO and who aren't vaccinated
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.200]  that's come out in the training manuals we're going to cover this and cover it more the
[13:34.200 --> 13:39.520]  nightly news and throughout the week I want to show you what their plan is who they go
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.280]  after in fact it's in the Australian news they're going to be no Germany is about as
[13:45.280 --> 13:52.280]  far advanced and this is any other country other than Communist China and Germany arrest
[13:52.280 --> 14:00.040]  homeschoolers arrest parents who try to homeschool children and then spends massive amounts of
[14:00.040 --> 14:05.360]  money in fact type in court rules German family to be sent back to Germany homeschooling family
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.120]  to be sent back to Germany it was in the news last week human events covered it and they've
[14:11.120 --> 14:21.360]  been here for three years upper middle class professional family with their children homeschooling
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.360]  they faced prison time or like Anne Frank for secretly homeschooling and not going to
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.040]  the government facility to be turned against their family shot up full of deadly cancer
[14:31.040 --> 14:39.840]  virus filled shots and input through the eugenics operation and so they fled as political asylum
[14:39.840 --> 14:46.080]  seekers here and they are being sent back to prison their children will be taken homeschooling
[14:46.080 --> 14:52.880]  family who fled the US from Germany faces deportation parents face charges and nine
[14:52.880 --> 14:57.120]  thousand dollar fine for taking kids out of school as Obama officials prepare to send
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.920]  them back yeah and that's a London that's a Daily Mail whitewash if you pull up human
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.820]  events it says they're facing I think it's five years in prison apiece and the state
[15:06.820 --> 15:11.000]  is licking their chops they're gonna get to hurt those kids and hurt them bad and of course
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.160]  you've already got brain-damaged mindless idiot government workers even the ones that
[15:15.160 --> 15:21.000]  aren't pedophile control freaks and they just like to follow their orders and that's the
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.960]  model that is already coming to the US and Australia Scotland every child to have State
[15:27.960 --> 15:36.320]  Guardian now remember what MSNBC said remember what MSNBC said they said we've got a break
[15:36.320 --> 15:43.380]  in a promo we've got a break of the idea that your kids belong to you they belong to us
[15:43.380 --> 15:50.800]  in the community with this weird academic lisping woman most these people are so anti-life
[15:50.800 --> 15:56.720]  they don't even have kids your kids are their kids and that's where these people then get
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.720]  kids to adopt and then get paid to adopt them after they've run them through a ringer they
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.200]  take them from you and they get to warehouse them they get to put them on five or six drugs
[16:06.200 --> 16:11.280]  they get the power trip of wrecking a child a slow human sacrifice and by the way I've
[16:11.280 --> 16:19.160]  had social workers on the blown the whistle I've had people that have been foster parents
[16:19.160 --> 16:23.940]  and they will tell you that the state is put them on as many drugs as possible if they
[16:23.940 --> 16:28.840]  raise their voice we get to put them on more drugs we're gonna you know we're gonna really
[16:28.840 --> 16:34.360]  all get rich off of hurting this kid I mean this is what it is and people are like oh
[16:34.360 --> 16:38.360]  yeah you know human sacrifice that's pretty much what this society is that's what it's
[16:38.360 --> 16:45.180]  based on these are government the New World Order is actually a society where the weak
[16:45.180 --> 16:50.880]  get to hurt the strong and the beautiful the secret of eugenics is it was created by inbred
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.880]  globalist royalty in Europe and funded by the Rothschilds and others and picked up by
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.640]  Hitler which just shows they're all birds of a feather that fly together and they're
[17:00.640 --> 17:09.200]  lust for power and domination and control and they actually target just normal healthy
[17:09.200 --> 17:15.640]  human activity because it's a threat to them because they never had it and so they're going
[17:15.640 --> 17:19.480]  to destroy it and they're going to be the only people left standing and they're exempt
[17:19.480 --> 17:25.440]  from all the taxes the regulations I was seeing statistics this morning I think I'll get to
[17:25.440 --> 17:30.720]  it in the stack where all over the Western world they're raising the pay of government
[17:30.720 --> 17:35.320]  bureaucrats and it's just growing and growing that's the plan wreck everything transfer
[17:35.320 --> 17:44.240]  the wealth that's the program let's go to that clip of Perry on on MSNBC we haven't
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.560]  had a very collective notion of these are our children so part of it is we have to break
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.760]  through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to
[17:52.760 --> 17:56.620]  their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's
[17:56.620 --> 18:01.700]  responsibility and not just the households then we start making better investments better
[18:01.700 --> 18:07.880]  investments off your labor sixty percent of your money in the US seventy to eighty percent
[18:07.880 --> 18:13.520]  in places like France it's not enough they're gonna people ask well how are they gonna make
[18:13.520 --> 18:18.400]  us live in 200 square foot coffin apartments well mayor Bloomberg and also the mayor of
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.980]  San Francisco mayor of New York and San Francisco have said we're gonna raise property tax until
[18:24.980 --> 18:30.160]  you're forced to live in this and then they will own the coffin buildings that you live
[18:30.160 --> 18:36.000]  in and then they'll land in their own private buildings that are you know fifty thousand
[18:36.000 --> 18:42.040]  square feet for themselves but they'll get an exemption they all get exemptions Bloomberg
[18:42.040 --> 18:49.040]  Michael Moore the head of General Electric Google they all don't pay taxes they don't
[18:49.040 --> 18:53.660]  pay in fact it's on record that when these really rich billionaires go at restaurants
[18:53.660 --> 18:57.840]  people learned everybody kisses their butt because they're rich and then they don't give
[18:57.840 --> 19:03.960]  a tip that's on record but you could talk to waiters and people they'll tell you rich
[19:03.960 --> 19:08.960]  people you know the really rich they don't give you tips middle class does is they actually
[19:08.960 --> 19:13.320]  worked for where they got and they actually want to help people they have an instinct
[19:13.320 --> 19:18.300]  to want to help and build others up and create an economy the globalist have an instinct

[24:52.440 --> 25:03.000]  i tell you that gmo has been designed and developed and filled with adjuvants and carcinogens
[25:03.000 --> 25:12.720]  carcinogens as well as active live microplasm encased nanotech cancer viruses and they really
[25:12.720 --> 25:17.520]  are nanotech they're they're engineered viruses when i tell you that and we've done countless
[25:17.520 --> 25:24.200]  reports on that subject you might want to go look into that kind of like for 15 years
[25:24.200 --> 25:31.840]  i've been telling you that the plastics they've chosen will change your entire metabolic rate
[25:31.840 --> 25:38.040]  will make women hyper feminine and then accelerate aging of their tissues ending in breast cancer
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.600]  and ovarian cancer and uterine cancer and will hyper feminize men leading to other cancers
[25:45.600 --> 25:54.460]  as well and then the media spends that that i'm being anti-gay because it makes men sexually
[25:54.460 --> 26:00.360]  conflicted in their different glands like the hypothalamus it also does that to other
[26:00.360 --> 26:10.520]  species not just other mammals but other families of animals amphibians fish marsupials i mean
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.760]  we're having a giant medical experiment done on us and i've covered in the film in game
[26:15.760 --> 26:20.940]  i've covered it in countless reports that we've done here on eugenics food the ultimate
[26:20.940 --> 26:28.000]  secret you can look that up 25 minute long short film brain eating viruses you know brain
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.080]  eating vaccine i kind of used a shocking term to get people to watch the video all of those
[26:33.080 --> 26:40.220]  are out there with the proof of what i just said and then i sit there watching large minorities
[26:40.220 --> 26:46.160]  of the public of every race color creed religion waking up to this and who are inquisitive
[26:46.160 --> 26:55.240]  and informed and want a future and then i see other people who wear their ignorance
[26:55.240 --> 27:02.960]  like a suit of armor whose greatest possession is that they don't care and some of them aren't
[27:02.960 --> 27:10.480]  even some of them aren't even stupid they consciously believe that not caring about
[27:10.480 --> 27:19.120]  anyone but themselves and being nihilistic and only caring about that minute is powerful
[27:19.120 --> 27:25.400]  and puts them above other people and that same spirit that you see in the very worst
[27:25.400 --> 27:31.240]  losers because they're generally incredible unhappy losers who go around messing with
[27:31.240 --> 27:35.340]  people all day and playing weird games and they feel completely powerless and they're
[27:35.340 --> 27:43.000]  completely unhappy and they have hellish lives devoid of honor the globalist are like that
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.600]  but are a little more sophisticated and i mean i'm here to tell you these people are
[27:49.600 --> 27:57.840]  not humans there's a six minute video up on infowars.com where americans have forgotten
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.800]  the meaning or don't know the meaning i forget the exact headline of memorial day and yeah
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.340]  there it is memory hole americans no longer know what memorial day stands for and mark
[28:08.340 --> 28:14.520]  dice goes out and and he does this in la we we do this in austin and get almost as bad
[28:14.520 --> 28:18.880]  a response they're not people aren't quite as but any trendy area and the people say
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.920]  i don't care about memorial day i don't care what it is i don't want to know what it is
[28:24.920 --> 28:31.720]  i don't care to find out what it is because it's all about me me and these people don't
[28:31.720 --> 28:37.360]  understand that when other people have that attitude and they do you at first when people
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.140]  have that attitude you might be able to get ahead at some level you end up being an unhappy
[28:42.140 --> 28:46.180]  person that dies alone but you might be able to find people that are stupid that you can
[28:46.180 --> 28:51.920]  cheat and manipulate and you might be able to monetarily get some symbols of success
[28:51.920 --> 28:59.280]  but those are those are those are garbage trappings the real wealth is friends and family
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.500]  and being honorable not that any of us are perfect but but you know trying to be honorable
[29:04.500 --> 29:08.960]  is the greatest wealth and and and getting to know other honorable people is the greatest
[29:08.960 --> 29:16.340]  experience in life and i look at these people we're gonna play part of this video when we

[34:03.560 --> 34:10.580]  you up and on the air i want to go over just some of the headlines that i'm going directly
[34:10.580 --> 34:15.260]  to your calls and then i'll go back into all of this in more details but i do want to play
[34:15.260 --> 34:23.480]  a part of this mark dice piece he'll be joining us on the radio show tomorrow most listeners
[34:23.480 --> 34:29.100]  don't know who mark dice is a lot of you do though and some listeners are like why do
[34:29.100 --> 34:36.780]  you why why why do you promote mark dice even though mark dice has attacked you before it's
[34:36.780 --> 34:46.060]  because i don't care uh mark does a lot of good work and so i positively reinforce that
[34:46.060 --> 34:51.100]  good work and i don't do it pavlovianly on purpose but it's kind of like when an ice
[34:51.100 --> 34:55.940]  cream truck comes around a lot of kids get so excited because the ice cream truck's got
[34:55.940 --> 35:02.900]  good things in it and you know i saw in mark i don't know it's got to be now eight years
[35:02.900 --> 35:07.820]  ago when he first got started got out of college with a public relations media degree he went
[35:07.820 --> 35:12.140]  out and did really great reports so i pretty much to a great extent helped put mark on
[35:12.140 --> 35:16.900]  the map but he was already doing great work he deserved to be on the map and then he went
[35:16.900 --> 35:23.100]  through his own personal stuff later i could i figured that and i'm not knocking the guy
[35:23.100 --> 35:28.820]  and and kind of went off into a bad area of his life it's like the prodigal son and when
[35:28.820 --> 35:33.020]  the prodigal son came back and the other son said i've done nothing to you father i've
[35:33.020 --> 35:38.540]  always been faithful now you're throwing a party for the prodigal son he's done all this
[35:38.540 --> 35:43.740]  bad stuff you know to you but it's like hey think how much i love you if i'm doing this
[35:43.740 --> 35:49.260]  for the prodigal son because i don't think mark fundamentally is a bad person and it's
[35:49.260 --> 35:55.780]  like that with everybody it hurts me to see people that i know have potential destroying
[35:55.780 --> 36:02.060]  it and it hurts me to see a society that has so much potential i mean i took my son to
[36:02.060 --> 36:12.500]  exercise this morning and we got done exercising at zilker park and i saw a bus pull up with
[36:12.500 --> 36:17.860]  regular kids they weren't special needs and i looked at these kids and they were clearly
[36:17.860 --> 36:25.660]  walking dead about a third of them because see when they hit you with gmo with every
[36:25.660 --> 36:32.180]  mammal species pigs guinea pigs rats rhesus monkeys you can look up the studies they go
[36:32.180 --> 36:40.660]  back probably 25 years with bt style that's the most popular
[36:40.660 --> 36:45.500]  corn and things that grow their own pesticides the first generation has a large iq reduction
[36:45.500 --> 36:52.100]  increased cancer sluggishness also more aggressiveness sometimes it manifests depending on your genetic
[36:52.100 --> 37:00.380]  tree your genetic blueprint of the type you are and then by the second generation and
[37:00.380 --> 37:05.540]  generations about 20 years humans tend to reproduce by about age 20 22 is the average
[37:05.540 --> 37:15.780]  i guess and we've got all of this you know garbage going on and i sit there and i look
[37:15.780 --> 37:20.060]  at people and you look at adults now that are one generation you know people they're
[37:20.060 --> 37:26.180]  25 30 years old under gmo and you look at the next generation people that are now five
[37:26.180 --> 37:31.420]  six seven eight ten years old who were born out of the last generation my god man the
[37:31.420 --> 37:38.700]  next generation it's going to be and you could see the numbers the cancer numbers the neurological
[37:38.700 --> 37:45.100]  disorder numbers the the the infertility numbers it is parabolic it is a straight up graph
[37:45.100 --> 37:52.620]  and that's why they've got to get their police state control grid in first before the real
[37:52.620 --> 37:57.860]  death starts because you're going to have mad parents and they they they said 50 years
[37:57.860 --> 38:02.740]  ago in papers we've dug up and covered on air that they knew some of us would find out
[38:02.740 --> 38:07.300]  about this program i mean hell they write books the white house science czar does about
[38:07.300 --> 38:13.780]  jacking our food and water to sterilize us and this is the psychopath sociopath sadist
[38:13.780 --> 38:20.660]  party i mean it's fun for them to uh i mean i go out in public and i and i'm from a globalist
[38:20.660 --> 38:25.980]  perspective but against it and my globalist perspective i see what's going on i am horrified
[38:25.980 --> 38:34.820]  by it i don't even become enraged anymore i become very sick and i can walk over to
[38:34.820 --> 38:39.540]  people that have an autistic child or two some people are so submissive they even when
[38:39.540 --> 38:44.780]  the first one gets brain damage and it has a seizure in the second round of shots they
[38:44.780 --> 38:49.940]  still take the next baby in and do it they're so submissive and i'll say hi how are you
[38:49.940 --> 38:58.300]  doing um so what's your son's name oh his name's you know david you know he's five years

[43:33.740 --> 43:39.620]  total empathy for humanity i love humanity i love our art our literature i want to support
[43:39.620 --> 43:44.780]  the better attributes of humanity and and you know i get up here with all this news
[43:44.780 --> 43:51.220]  our government funding al-qaeda mccain going to meet with al-qaeda rand paul coming out
[43:51.220 --> 43:56.700]  and saying you know we're funding al-qaeda the emperor has no clothes god bless rand
[43:56.700 --> 44:02.140]  paul you know he's played a little politics with them but he's playing them not the other
[44:02.140 --> 44:06.260]  way around and they know that that's why the neocons and the liberals hate him god bless
[44:06.260 --> 44:11.780]  him and i've got all this other nsa news i've got scotland saying every child have a state
[44:11.780 --> 44:15.940]  guardian who reports on the parents you're all guilty until your family's destroyed it's
[44:15.940 --> 44:19.140]  not guilty until proven innocent and you're no longer innocent until proven guilty you're
[44:19.140 --> 44:23.420]  guilty until we kill you we're going to suck everything out of you and then we're going
[44:23.420 --> 44:28.100]  to blow you away and of course the little mind-numbed brainwashed minions of the system
[44:28.100 --> 44:33.580]  they don't know that they're on a power trip of running other people's lives when they
[44:33.580 --> 44:38.040]  can't even run their own i've got all this news i've got your calls i'm going to get
[44:38.040 --> 44:43.040]  to everybody it's just that if you want to know where i'm at it's the eugenics it is
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.880]  the artificial environment they're trying to build for us and it's that i can't sit
[44:47.880 --> 44:56.400]  there and walk down the street and see a family and instantly see their children with a million
[44:56.400 --> 45:01.160]  mile stare and and and see their kid you know staring at the ground and see them and go
[45:01.160 --> 45:05.780]  oh is your child autistic they're like yeah how do you know well i mean and a lot of times
[45:05.780 --> 45:12.540]  they'll have pairs of them and they go they tell us it's genetic yeah yeah it is genetic
[45:12.540 --> 45:16.780]  there are some people who can be shot in the heart and survive because genetically they've
[45:16.780 --> 45:22.100]  got extra arteries extra connections extra electrical impulses they're really tough but
[45:22.100 --> 45:28.300]  it's the bullet through the heart that would kill you know 99 out of 100 but not some people
[45:28.300 --> 45:35.860]  like rasputin you know air you know in the in the czar court it took them like an hour
[45:35.860 --> 45:39.880]  to killing some people got thicker skulls some people you can't knock them out because
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.100]  genetically how they're wired they're and and how their bone structure's set up you
[45:44.100 --> 45:47.620]  got to bash their brains out to knock them out other people you can knock them out they
[45:47.620 --> 45:52.100]  got a glass chin but it isn't it isn't that you have genetics of a glass chin why you're
[45:52.100 --> 45:57.060]  knocked out it's because you were punched in the chin you're getting cancer you should
[45:57.060 --> 46:01.220]  be getting it when you're 90 years old and you've had the replication of your cells not
[46:01.220 --> 46:07.380]  when you're 15 you've been put in an environment that is now accessing your genetics and causing
[46:07.380 --> 46:18.420]  the mutations and i just realized that's everything and i'm gonna tell my whole crew all of them
[46:18.420 --> 46:24.060]  i want to go into the gmos i want to go into the admissions of diet injections injunctions
[46:24.060 --> 46:27.860]  like bertrand russell talked about the brain damage and dumb down the public i want to
[46:27.860 --> 46:33.820]  just constantly beat the drum of the thousands of harvard and stanford studies and and oxford
[46:33.820 --> 46:38.780]  studies and you know about sodium fluoride what it does to the brain and and you know
[46:38.780 --> 46:46.460]  what they're doing i want to hammer how they've done this to us because we're seen as a plague
[46:46.460 --> 46:53.980]  and we're being soft killed we're being dumbed down ahead of the larger cull
[46:53.980 --> 47:06.500]  is we have to have a break with the globalist they never want people to come to the realization
[47:06.500 --> 47:10.060]  that this is going on that's why they don't want to talk about how we give 85 million
[47:10.060 --> 47:14.300]  dollars a month to foreign banks and congress won't be told who totally illegal totally
[47:14.300 --> 47:20.180]  unconstitutional treason a thousand times over the chart they they go so overboard on
[47:20.180 --> 47:25.480]  purpose because it works they fund al-qaeda publicly to commit war crimes all over the
[47:25.480 --> 47:31.440]  world and then invade the countries to get rid of the al-qaeda they put in but then don't
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.220]  even go after the al-qaeda they actually go after innocent people and that's so over the
[47:35.220 --> 47:41.580]  top they get away with it it's so over the top to have hundreds hundreds of fbi training
[47:41.580 --> 47:46.680]  manuals that are sent out to barber shops hardware stores gun shops let's say hundreds
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.520]  it's over 200 last year put out to every type of business there is tailored to them on what
[47:51.520 --> 47:56.740]  to look for and it's it makes everything an act of terror or terror so that everyone can
[47:56.740 --> 48:02.700]  be seen as a terrorist to create a total culture of paranoia instead of being concerned about
[48:02.700 --> 48:07.520]  the government historically that's the real danger and is running the terrorist common
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.860]  sense founding fathers world history oh no the government didn't do anything wrong they're
[48:13.860 --> 48:18.820]  not corrupt that's a conspiracy theory how crazy alex jones is it's your neighbor you
[48:18.820 --> 48:28.260]  can't trust over the top two billion bullets paper targets of five-year-olds they're training
[48:28.260 --> 48:34.440]  to kill even when the company comes out and admits it's real never hits the news uh seven
[48:34.440 --> 48:43.980]  thousand just last year seven thousand three hundred anti-mine heavy armored vehicles training
[48:43.980 --> 48:48.480]  for war with us and while they tell us the enemies everywhere the muslim extremists when
[48:48.480 --> 48:58.500]  they run them all of this all of this is just over the top cuckoo land and then i see a
[48:58.500 --> 49:02.620]  video we will play the next segment then calls the next hour in the news i'm gonna get to
[49:02.620 --> 49:10.020]  everybody sheila i love the name sheila i like in australia they call women's sheilas
[49:10.020 --> 49:21.280]  period uh uh jason mark julio samson and others we're gonna get to all of you but i just want
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.340]  humanity to make it i want us to really work together and be honorable instead the general
[49:27.340 --> 49:35.060]  public has taken on the attitude of not caring about anybody getting ahead and it is a disaster
[49:35.060 --> 49:46.460]  just a bunch of self-centered egotistical people that have never even faced real challenges
[49:46.460 --> 49:50.660]  having no idea how the rest of the world lives or what our ancestors have gone through to
[49:50.660 --> 49:55.140]  take us to this point and then the very worst of us are in control because they cravenly
[49:55.140 --> 50:03.580]  crave it and not recognizing people like you're negative no i'm not i'm positive and by not
[50:03.580 --> 50:08.380]  recognizing the great evil we allow it to take over i look at the articles at info wars

[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.760]  me today and I'd like to encourage your listeners to get a pencil out and take some notes on
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.440]  this brief visit I have with you the smart meters are part of an infrastructure of wireless
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.000]  technology that really got in our homes back in the 1980s with the cordless phones with
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.960]  the antennas that pulled out well as these things so convenient these personal devices
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.920]  like our cordless home phones baby monitors and Wi-Fi as well as these smart meters emit
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.200]  900 million waves per second so everything you've been talking about this morning regarding
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:06.560]  autism the influence of GMOs on our digital they've done university studies you put fish
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.840]  near a router or plants you name it and ends up making the plants not grow as fast or not
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.240]  germinate and ends up making the fish mentally retarded but that's that's a good thing government
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.560]  loves us well the thing is these personal devices your cordless phone baby monitors
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.960]  etc were designed to service your home radius these smart meters are set up to cover square
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.480]  miles of penetration of these frequencies they've been linked to cancer and death what's
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:40.280]  wrong with that are you an extremist you know what I am a person who says no when it comes
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:46.640]  to my community so in our little 5,000 population in the center of Texas we implemented Texas
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.520]  local government code 9.004 which allowed by petition of the people to write up and
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:59.600]  change our city charter to specifically allow utility customers the right to reject installation
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.680]  or request removal of any product or service you know that's awesome I'm gonna read about
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.440]  cities and people passing stuff like that send us send us the proposal is it and we'll
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.920]  do a story on it send it to show tips at info wars.com what city are you in I'm in Brady

[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.200]  Alex can do what we did it is the purest form of democracy where the people write up so

[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:51.820]  this up like i bet it's even on their website for the entire week i was there they were
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:13:02.360]  having the arkansas uh water treatment uh convention in town at the big convention center
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:06.360]  they've got there in hot springs where they have the horse races and the arlington was
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:12.480]  full of water managers because it was just the managers and their assistants there of
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:17.520]  the entire state of arkansas and let me tell you something i couldn't get in the pool i
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.300]  couldn't get in the hot tub i couldn't get on and off the elevator i couldn't go eat
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:28.240]  at a restaurant across the street without good old boy water heads people that run their
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.200]  town's water i'm not going to say some of the names some of them were good sized cities
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.560]  coming over and shaking my hand and going let me tell you something we dumped that stuff
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.240]  out in the woods and it kills the trees it's so deadly we don't have any place to do it
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.160]  but you're right and we're not putting it in the water and we hadn't been putting the
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.960]  water for years another guy boom shaking my hand you were going to beat these people don't
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.240]  you worry we don't put that in the water boom another guy grabs my arm i mean the whole time
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:14:00.200]  and it just hit me during the break i had forgotten about that
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.600]  and i guess they don't hire you as the head of the water department unless you're like
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.640]  a six foot four really mean looking redneck and the black guys were like black rednecks
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:14.600]  the point was is that i mean it felt good and then i just was in a daze and would hard
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.300]  and then we had listeners and i wasn't saying where i was until the day i left every day
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:25.640]  about five six seven people i would like be in the bar downstairs looking for guys with
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.360]  their wives and people with their kids and people from little rock drove in america is
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:36.260]  starting to awaken is what i'm telling you and you know why the arkansas people were
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:44.840]  so mad they voted three years ago at all these different county and city levels to take the
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:51.560]  fluoride out you can look this up and then last year they passed a state law via federal
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:57.760]  funding to forcibly put hydrofluorosolic acid and everything else that comes with it up
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.840]  upwards of 350 chemicals some are only a hundred and something it depends where you get it
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:07.560]  some of us from florida montana china mongolia they mined phosphates for fertilizer you can
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:14.920]  mine into limestone deposits and find the different things that plants need and it's
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:20.600]  not brondo electrolytes to quote idiocracy and they go in there and but it's full of
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.520]  toxic waste you've got to purify it out well the stuff that's left radioactive isotopes
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.840]  you name it is put in our water and everybody always knew this and i was talking to these
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.280]  guys they're like i've been listening to you for 15 years and finally people are listening
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.360]  let me tell you two years ago that harvard study really helped and blah blah blah that's
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.480]  when we finally and you know i just remembered why i didn't tell anybody this because i had
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.840]  a thought after happening like 50 times that wait if i talk about this see nobody's perfect
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.400]  the feds will know about it but they already know and then they'll come around snooping
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.640]  but you know what i just had the split second understanding good go mess with the rednecks
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:06.160]  even more sin fed's in to harass them to poison their families they know this stuff is roach
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:12.440]  poison they know it's killing people and and some of them were telling me yeah my wife's
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.880]  got cancer she's only 40 i want to die i don't know when the shooting war is going to start
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.360]  but i'm getting sick of these people i mean just keep pushing it new world order that's
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:30.040]  all i got to say to you because i totally and completely forgot that i had my hand shook
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.840]  off of me and by the way i was staying on the other end of town mile like five miles
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.720]  away from where the convention was i would walk down the street with my children and
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:47.140]  run into the water people when they were out at night and stuff and so again ladies and
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.480]  gentlemen the globalists are spying on stuff they know how awake america is that's why
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.800]  they're panicking because no one wants to kill their kids it doesn't help your teeth
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.160]  putting that in the water and it's not calcium fluoride you need some of for your teeth you
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:07.600]  need some calcium fluoride it's natural they go it's natural that's like saying you know
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.080]  you need some lead it's natural and then shooting somebody in the head and going what i gave
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:21.920]  you your lead supplement you've all heard the analogy of drinking sunscreen so you don't
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.640]  burn your skin drinking it for your teeth my dad is a dentist by the way and if you
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:32.240]  want it he'll give it to you but he's convinced about the fluoride because it's toxic waste
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.880]  ladies and gentlemen it's not even regular fluoride now this lady called in uh sheila
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:41.760]  and she was involved she says in all this she told us about it as towns say no signs

[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.760]  control system that ties into all the other electronics another way they're sneaking this
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:27.780]  in is smart house systems where you actually bring the trojan horse in yourself and pay
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:34.020]  for it and again these technologies wouldn't be bad if the globalist weren't engineering
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:43.760]  it to be oppressive but here is new york times associated press sourcefednews.com all of
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.640]  it look at this connect is always listening on your xbox one we reported this two years
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.960]  ago but privacy is a top priority for microsoft what a joke and it says well if you have it
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:00.400]  set to high privacy it only gives the cpu enough power to spy on certain keywords but
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.380]  if you really want to have it you know face scan you when you enter the room and basically
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.640]  talk to you you've got to have it on the other settings so you're not allowed to not have
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:12.620]  it spy on you remember i told you 10 years ago that google had patents to watch everything
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:19.000]  you're doing over the camera and microphone and sell it to the nsa oh yeah right now it's
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:28.080]  just out in the open xbox one is watching you and there's no way to turn it off and
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:33.560]  you're not allowed to play unless it's online and then you go pay to bring it into your
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.260]  house and then they have the cia director going yeah we're watching everything you do
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:48.020]  without warrants don't listen to that kook alex jones though just like it's mainstream
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:54.040]  news that mccain met with wahabiists that actually wear al-qaeda uniforms and fly al-qaeda
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:26:01.240]  flags demanding more taxpayer money to them but your attractive wife because that's we've
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:06.120]  done studies you've seen in the news that's who they're gonna pull she's gonna get grubbed
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:13.240]  man by guys that and women because the women you know the ones that like doing that are
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:19.840]  people that like to force something on someone can you imagine that only in america they're
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.040]  going to have to look inside your underwear there's a new video out one of our activists
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.480]  where they're grabbing on her she says don't touch me there and they of course do because
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.880]  that's why they want that job i mean in the old days you go to a park and do that you
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.040]  go to jail if you're one of those type of people but now now you have to wear a uniform
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:49.960]  and because of al-qaeda oh man works great doesn't it drink your fluoride folks drink
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:54.480]  your fluoride okay uh sheila make your point about what you guys did getting rid of the
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:02.840]  smart meters in uh your area of texas as reported on by the new york times well alex um finding
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:09.880]  texas local government code 9.004 was of itself a battle uh this started out in october when
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:15.200]  our city council indebted our small community 2.5 million dollars to put in all these smart
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.640]  meters of water electrical and gas meters on our homes they did this with two line sentence
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.960]  in our city agenda which we thought as being a violation of texas opens meetings law but
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.680]  there's a real good reason why you have the same you can't beat city hall and that's a
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:36.520]  long story into itself but because of uh right after that i started submitting agenda action
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.640]  item forms to be an action item on the agenda which was denied to me five times by our mayor
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.120]  who happens to live across the street from me and we share a parking lot at work so you
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.760]  don't get much closer to your elected officials uh even in this small little community i was
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:59.680]  literally blocked five times for even having the ability to seek action to my elected officials
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.600]  which by the way is illegal under the state constitution and again it shows how there's
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.720]  a wall because they know they're in the wrong and there's always money paid one way or other
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.720]  and it turns out smart meters break more often cost more money have to be replaced quicker
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:19.600]  so it actually also is another boondoggle on top of it well in in one report after a
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:25.200]  matter of hours in one little home uh there was already a dishwasher fire well who never
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.560]  heard of a dishwasher fire you know that just doesn't happen okay so then because of all
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.720]  the high profile and the fact that there's so many issues about the smart meter but let
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.040]  me tell you personally the reason i'm in this to the magnitude of sacrifice and time and
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.120]  energy is the health consequences your pineal gland that detects darkness can't tell the
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.680]  difference between light frequencies and the frequencies from these highs right so you're
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.600]  never really getting sleep you're never absolutely studies in rats you can look them up and they
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:00.020]  actually sleep better when the wireless is off well i had a vietnam bet i have a little
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:05.200]  wellness shop and so i had people come in all the time about sleeping problems and he
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.680]  was sleeping one hour a day i said joe go get rid of your cordless phone turn off your
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.320]  wi-fi put your cell phone in the room and alex he starts sleeping four to five hours
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.720]  a night uh people come in complaining migraines and headaches ask them do you have curly light
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:22.840]  bulbs the complex fluorescence yes i do get rid of they put out something like ten thousand
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:28.720]  times the radiation of a regular light bulb they have 500 units of grand steps or units
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.360]  of radiation compared to an incandescent that has 30 so as people go replace their ceiling
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.360]  fan with four light bulbs before they had 120 units of radiation and now they have over
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:44.240]  two thousand now when you look into this tell you what stay there and we've got a website

[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.680]  in if you care about any i mean seriously the government is totally criminal it's all
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.760]  come out that they are engaging in a clash of civilizations some of the low-level people
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:11.640]  may not be criminal but i am going to be i'm going to be traveling to england and covering
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:17.440]  that regardless paul watson is going to be there i've been playing phone tag with one
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:22.120]  of the senior police in the area who wants to talk to me but i called him this morning
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.760]  and he said i'm driving i'm not allowed to talk on the phone when i'm driving i think
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.840]  they even have a law there against it with the hands-free because the nanny state said
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.720]  so he said i'll call you back when i'm not driving anymore but by then i was on air so
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:40.600]  i'll try to get a hold of them to find out what's going on with that and a lot of other
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:48.800]  things coming up ladies and gentlemen by the way we're working on a guest that was a lawyer
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.280]  inside the system well i'll leave it at that until coming up in the next segment i'll give
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.880]  you an idea if we're going to be doing that in the last 30 minutes of the next hour or
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.880]  not but let's i've been talking about smart meters or talking about how all this is happening
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:06.160]  we're going to go back and let shila finish her point there's also a website we can put
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.360]  on screen for tv viewers if people want to visit it as kind of a model for their state
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:21.880]  it's banned texas smart meters and what is the url banned texas smart meters.com and
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:27.740]  again the lady that we have on the line i'm glad she told us about this it's in the new
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:31.700]  york times what she and others have been able to do but she was the one that han showed
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:37.960]  it to start as towns say no signs of rising resistance to smart meters brady texas is
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:42.800]  where it starts and it talks about what she and others did again more of our listeners
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.240]  taking action but i thought before we went back to her since we got on this subject the
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.540]  lord moves in mysterious ways let me show you some of these articles here for those
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.440]  of you that are in denial we showed wired magazine and ap earlier where the cia says
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.160]  they're watching and listening to you via all the smart stuff in your house without
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:06.160]  warrants and by the way you're the target and they know this stuff is frying you frying
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:13.260]  you you ready to hear first google's ambient background spy tech and it has the patent
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:19.660]  in our article that first reported on it in 2006 people thought we were lying that's prison
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:25.320]  planet dot com here's the daily mail is nothing off limits now google plans to spy on background
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:30.400]  noise in your phone calls to bombard you with tailored adverts and that's already begun
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.560]  but it's not just your phone calls it's your computer in your house it's everything and
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.940]  then it breaks down their patent from 2006 and they're already doing it by the way they
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:45.880]  are the nsa verizon follows google and turning phones tv into info wiretaps so you got to
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.760]  have a new digital tv they got microphones built in they're tracking everything you do

[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.360]  some burial insurance on you and your family because people are going to start dying real

[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.400]  decade or so it'll be 20 000 from the numbers i've seen i mean it's just going to get where
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.580]  everybody's dying but it's like trendy well let's jog to get funding for all the sick
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:29.980]  people and fundraisers for everybody that has cancer instead of why is everybody dying
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:35.480]  and it's in america we lead the world england's next and there's cops in england listening

[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:56.120]  to die prepare to die i mean the government is listening to everything they're poisoning
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:02.160]  the food in the water of course they're evil of course the irs is persecuting liberty groups
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.860]  of course the un runs child kidnapping rings oh yeah right look it up thousands of mainstream
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:15.600]  articles i'm ranting i said i'd go to your calls it's just yeah i'm right i know what
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:22.680]  i'm talking about i warned you because they were bragging about it i'm nothing special
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:26.960]  except when people say they're killing me and spying on me and jacking me and doing
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.480]  all this stuff and the honeybees eat the corn pollen and all die and then the studies come
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:38.160]  out in germany and canada and government studies confirming it i mean i read that article like
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:43.300]  five times last year on air out of the washington post where it said farmers are breaking gmo
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:51.000]  planting rules not creating sanctuaries for the insects when they have these gmo wheat
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:00.200]  crops potato crops corn crops all of it they have to plant another field the same size
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:04.920]  so that all the insects don't die see the globals don't want all the insects to die
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.600]  so you've got to plant something for the insects to eat and then the humans are given it i
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:14.520]  mean it is just and i'm just supposed to sit up for a day after day oh i'm alex shones

[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:24.600]  jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones all right if
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:28.100]  you just joined us i've gotten into some of the news but i haven't hit the top stories
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:34.560]  in detail yet kind of went off into the whole electronic spy grid from xbox connect to smart
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.880]  meters i want to get into mccain going and hanging out with al-qaeda leadership ram paul's
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:46.600]  come out and said why are we supporting al-qaeda again that's a big move even though it's public
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:51.280]  information still nobody else will do that that's why i like ran paul that's a real deal
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.980]  folks i hate to even be honest with the audience about this because i don't usually support
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:03.280]  politicking but ran paul and ted cruz are playing them not the other way around and they already
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:06.700]  know that i mean i'm not saying a secret when they were when the republicans were trying
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:11.020]  to stop him in the primaries a few years ago when the democrats did after they were like
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:14.920]  we know he's really like alex jones and putting on a big act like he wants to work with the
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:20.860]  system and that's not how i do it and and and you know like ran's like i support the
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:25.520]  amnesty bill so that then when they get it and it's a total payoff and criminal he can
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:31.360]  have credibility to kill it same thing with ted cruz because uh yeah it's just they know
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.480]  what they're doing and and it's it's something to behold uh let's go to julio in illinois
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:42.580]  julio you're on the air what do you got today buddy uh hi alex um yeah i was at the uh march
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:49.040]  against monsanto on saturday in chicago and it was just astonishing to see all the all
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.840]  the people that were there there are about several hundred people downtown chicago but
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:58.780]  from all political ideologies were there and it was quite beautiful to see and uh you know
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:04.700]  you mentioned about an hour ago how you want to focus solely on gmos and this uh genetic
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:09.780]  revolution i want to focus on it more because it's the i mean they're poisoning us on record
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:13.720]  and where they admit they're doing it and all the elite won't eat it and the elite won't
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.520]  have smart crap in their house because it it spies on them and it's hurting them all
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.120]  the big rich hollywood people i know all the big globalists that come out in the news that
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:28.220]  i've read about they go to rural areas to be away from all the electronics and with
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:33.720]  landlines and nothing but pure foods for their families they know what they're doing it's
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:38.960]  game over they're killing us i'm sorry i'm sorry just every time i i realize it i get
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:46.760]  upset ulio if i caught a neighbor in my house putting poison soft kill poison in my flower
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:52.400]  or or or or in grain i would stomp their guts out and it's not that i'm some tough guy but
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.480]  i mean i am you know a man here and these people are killing us and i've had enough
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:02.000]  of the crap i'm sorry go ahead no i hear you alex you know that's why i i embarked myself
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.560]  as a independent journalist to to cover g m o's and and whether modernist genetic modifying
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:12.320]  society that's going on not spoke to uh... you know university california davis professor
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:18.000]  kent bradford who was pretty open with me and telling me that about ninety percent of
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.560]  what you purchase at the grocery store is g m o's and was tell me how wonderful it would
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.280]  be alex introduced to your children and and to other children throughout the world uh...
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.820]  fruits and vegetables like apples that will never turn brown never go rotten because of
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:36.840]  g m o's and how how wonderful that would be or i spoke to a diplomat from the united nations
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:42.160]  who told me how wonderful it would be alex to send third world nations drought resistant
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:47.720]  seeds so we could feed third world populations and i saw the documentary it's excellent but
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.840]  but i mean here's what here's what's crazy there could be genetic engineering that would
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.160]  actually help they are designing it to hurt you on purpose i've had the top scientist
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:04.920]  on who quit over this before to about my alma mater joel gruber who's a doctor and and that's
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.800]  what he told me he told me he he he thinks there could be some benefits of genetic engineering
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.960]  but the way companies like monstanto cargo and the rest are doing they're doing this
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:19.680]  purposely to destroy crops and one last thing alex you know i i saw the rachel maddow clip
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:24.720]  of her you know talking about whether or not it's it's so funny but here's a few things
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:31.040]  number one nbc universal now owned by tomcast owns the weather channel so you know why would
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.160]  you know why would people want to look up weather modification and then and then secondly
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:41.120]  alex rachel maddow kind of did a disservice to what she was trying to do hopefully even
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:45.960]  if it's just one person watch what she said and actually looked up weather modification
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:51.800]  and actually saw government documents she just did a disservice and and one last thing
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:59.440]  uh i i kind of uh uh what's the keys to this towards the end of my film but i have on stay

[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:24.400]  we have the filmmaker of the documentary genetically modified society who got in
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:29.520]  julio he's done reporting for us in the past and we are changed up in chicago i've seen it
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:33.920]  we should air that on the nightly news uh it's been introduced in the uh hundred thousand dollar
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:41.440]  film contest we've got like 500 entries uh i've watched let's not exaggerate 150 of them or so
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.680]  on top of going to belderberg on top of running the news operation trying to make obama deception
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.760]  too i'm not complaining i just that's why i get busy almost the point of being crazy uh there's
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.360]  so much like whack-a-mole these moles are coming up i've got to watch all the other ones and i've
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:03.840]  got to judge it first place one hundred thousand dollars uh second place um ten thousand dollars
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:12.080]  third place five thousand dollars but everybody that enters it gets a chance to uh work with us
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.600]  on film projects in the future here's my greatest frustration i have a stack of sponsors that will
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:24.880]  pay us you know 30 sponsors on radio and tv for live plugs on the radio you hear me even skipping
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:29.600]  the network ads which costs the network money but because i'm the number one show on genesis that
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:36.880]  has over 1400 affiliates over 1400 affiliates now on gcn it's like the third largest maybe the
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:43.840]  second largest uh radio network in the us they don't put on airs it's a modest operation but
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:49.840]  they really are uh almost as successful as talk radio network maybe as successful and then above
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:57.440]  that of course clear channel but it's a small company basically that's on the margins of the
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:05.200]  non-monopoly you know big giant radio stations but my big frustration is i want to be able to
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.200]  hire more reporters more journalists more researchers more people i don't have time
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:15.440]  so much to even hire them and then train them and then who assigns the stories i mean it's just
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:21.760]  there's so much but i'm trying and i'll tell you if we had the money we have to have a modest
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:25.680]  backup so we could run three four months if all the money got turned off but other than that
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:30.720]  and i could sell a little bit of real estate i have if things ever got really bad but we
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:36.160]  we we are running on a shoestring people hear me say we cost seven million dollars
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:41.680]  to run in fall wars every year folks small newspapers you know in in say a town like
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:49.200]  abilene i've seen the numbers might cost 10 million a year to run okay for what we reach
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:54.480]  for the amount of people i reach if i work for the globalist i would be paid 20 million dollars a
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:59.440]  year i've been offered that kind of money i mean 12 years ago i don't mean to digress here i want
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:04.320]  to go to your phone calls i was told you'll have a tv show you'll have a book deal this is all
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:11.520]  lined up you do what we say and up front you know here's millions of dollars and it wasn't
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:18.560]  hard for me to not sell out because i i live to talk about this real information
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.160]  and we've been somewhat successful on our own but i sit here running around spending my time
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.760]  trying to get money in here to fund things and if i didn't have to spend my time on that we'd
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:35.680]  be much more effective and we are very effective you know they have big trade publications
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:41.040]  right about how we're the model of new media and i have bloomberg and the new york times and
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:49.200]  vanity fair and the london guardian and just everybody calling gq uh esquire uh
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:54.800]  how do you do it what are you doing how do you because they see the real numbers they know we
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:58.240]  really do reach 15 million people a week one way or another that's a conservative number
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:03.760]  they know they're dying while we're growing how do i do it if i read 15 articles where google says
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:08.320]  they're watching us and and and you know they admit the smart meters are giving us cancer
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.880]  and they admit you know they catch the un adding sterilants to vaccines and i've got you know the
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:20.640]  times of india reporting on it i mean i'm going to cover that and i guess because i'm flamboyant
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.960]  in that i get upset by this i take it personal i'm freaked out i'm living in a science fiction
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:34.880]  dystopia it's getting worse by the minute i know it's real i've gotten the phone calls my wife's
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.000]  gotten the phone calls saying you don't stop what you're doing we're going to kill you
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:45.120]  and you say you know a couple of pejoratives at them that'll be honest that's what you do
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.320]  they're like really you were just talking to your uncle or your mom or your dad about this
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:57.680]  you better watch it i'm like no you better watch it you think you're safe working for people that
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:04.320]  give you the type of power be able to do this that's why i don't have bodyguards and nothing
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.360]  okay i'm in god's hands and if they kill me tomorrow that's the way it is i am not part
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:14.240]  of diseasing and killing all these children i'm not just talking about abortion and partial birth
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.640]  abortion i mean all the walking dead out there and they're killing everybody it's getting worse
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:26.240]  by the month and i will not sign on to it i will not be part of it bill gates father former head
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:31.680]  of planned parenthood known eugenicist constant meetings about they're trying to reduce population
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.320]  making jokes about releasing our number down to zero at ted conferences and all the fellow
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:42.240]  travelers laugh at it man i take that serious people say well why do you like mike judge
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:50.640]  he made a film about eugenics everybody being dumbed down they're dumbing us down on purpose
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:57.280]  real eugenics is about dumbing people down to get rid of them it's about a lion eating the
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.880]  other male baby lion or grizzly bear eating the male grizzly the baby so it doesn't have
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:11.120]  to be challenged by him later for territory and mates that's all these globalists are into man
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:18.160]  we're under attack we're under a war and there probably are in some areas too many people
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:24.800]  but we they won't let us develop the technologies to empower humanity instead some smiley face punk
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.920]  gets to talk about how he's rolling out mosquitoes it'll forcibly inject you with crap whether you
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:35.280]  like it or not last time i said that some idiot sent a comment on the site going mosquitoes suck
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.000]  they don't inject if you weren't so stupid some of you willfully you might actually be able to have a
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:48.560]  life mosquitoes inject high-powered saliva out of their proboscis into your bloodstream to liquefy
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:55.600]  the platelets and to assanguinate the juices that's why the patents on record are they're
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.040]  already been caught all over the world loading mosquitoes with forced vaccines
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:08.400]  and the vaccines are to reduce fertility the vaccines are to give you cancer delayed action
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:17.200]  and the cancers are to reduce iq look it up okay you don't believe me look up patents for
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:22.880]  for mosquito to deliver vaccines they've already caught them doing it it's going on right now in
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:30.960]  florida and i take it personal that some smiley face billionaire piece of garbage is up there
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:37.920]  laughing on ted tv about reducing our numbers down to zero while he thinks it's funny now listen here
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:43.120]  to all of you that serve the system you see them saying the veterans are the terrorists because in
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.200]  the next 10 to 15 years if they have their way we're holding them back they say they're 10 years
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:50.480]  behind people like where's the new world order well i didn't got a lot worse because we're holding
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.560]  them back we're holding the door people are like saying are you sure there's something on the other
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:59.680]  side are you can hear the scraping on the other side the battering ram you can see the history
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:04.720]  and people there it is super mosquitoes could fight malaria with a bite and deliver it oh but
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:16.080]  it's nice see oh god okay i said i'd go to your calls julio you made that film it's great what
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:20.000]  was your last point because i gotta get to everybody else or i'll get to nobody i appreciate
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.280]  that alex and uh it towards the end of the film i teased i really didn't have enough time to to
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:30.000]  expose weather modification the way i wanted to but the director of national weather service kind
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.680]  of hinted that uh oh yes there there there has been weather modification but oh we're not doing
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.880]  that anymore uh you know that that's just whole technology well a couple weeks later i went to
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:45.680]  your neck of the woods out in san antonio texas attending a weather modification conference which
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:52.240]  doesn't exist i that doesn't exist they told me i had one person tell me that a government
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:59.040]  organization permits and approves all of the cloud seeding all of the solar radiation management
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:03.280]  no no there's a there's a congressional weather modification board uh under the department of
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:09.040]  energy no it's well known uh k billy hutchinson introduced that bill i believe back in 2005 but
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.920]  i'm currently working right now as we speak on a freedom of information act request i don't want
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:19.920]  to pull a bright part and say too much but what i what i'm going to uncover it's pretty shocking
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:24.720]  and it will make rachel maddow look more like a fool than than she already is yeah because what
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:29.600]  i said was i said whether modification is real this probably wasn't this is probably a real
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:35.840]  tornado and then she edited it to where it sounds like i'm saying obama sent the tornado and she
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:40.480]  should probably take that clip out and play it and it's a desperation move god bless you julio
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:45.200]  break it with us here when you get it that's a great reporter wish you had the money to hire him
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.800]  and bring him down here i just don't have it that's why you need to buy the books buy the videos
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:54.320]  buy the propure water filters support our sponsors because folks we are the best there is at fighting
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:58.960]  this doesn't mean we're great we're the best there is henry in south africa thanks for holding henry
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:06.640]  then sam nolan sean and others go ahead hey alex uh greetings in the name of our lord jesus christ
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:11.280]  amen thank you for giving hope to people out there i've been listening to your show for a
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:18.960]  couple of years i'm about 39 years of age and an it engineer um i live on the coast uh south of
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:24.560]  the south part of kotan and uh basically i see that it's real uh there are a lot of cameras
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:29.200]  coming up all over the place all over the national roads as well in our country novie seems to be
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:34.240]  assuming responsibility for them or what they're doing uh but it's pretty plain to see that they
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:40.080]  basically want to stop spying on everybody as well this side um it's worse in janisburg but a
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:45.120]  lot all over the national roads and also the banks in our country as well when the people's accounts
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.800]  are running into debit more and more these days it's becoming more frequent because of the pressure
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:54.000]  of this uh satanic system that basically we're under and bottom line is that people now banks
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.400]  are charging them more than they can afford to put back when their accounts are on in debit
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:04.560]  and yeah to explain this we can build unlimited civilizations of the technology we have the
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.840]  globalists admit that they are artificially imploding the world economy into their hands
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:14.880]  and out of the social revolution that comes they're going to use the giant unwashed mass
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:21.200]  to fully enslave the producers this is a globalist war against thinking people a killing fields like
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:27.440]  the camera rouge uh a hellish worldwide meltdown in fact i have a stack of news on that i'm going

[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.080]  that said bloomberg's been calling me a bunch doing some piece and i thought it was already
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:35.760]  out because i said may 26 i thought oh it must have already happened that was in 2009 there's
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:42.480]  another piece coming out this week but it's conspiracy buffs warn of kissinger cabal red

[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:58.560]  engine part from 911 jones is discredited and he says 911 didn't even happen what oklahoma city
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:06.640]  didn't happen no i didn't say that i said the globalists clearly carried out oklahoma city and
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:11.360]  on 911 they were financing and protecting the al-qaeda people that were involved that even came
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:17.120]  out in newsweek that they were protected and allowed to be involved in it just like i have
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:21.600]  mainstream news articles after i go to your calls i'm going to go over with ram paul going why are
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:29.200]  we arming al-qaeda to attack syria that's associated press that's reuters i i thought that was crazy
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.640]  when i said that see it is crazy that they're funding al-qaeda publicly while telling you give
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:41.680]  your rights up but i'm not the one that's crazy okay there are literally thousands of studies
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:49.280]  that hydrofluorosolic acid lowers your iq gives you bone cancer pancreatic cancer uh
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:56.880]  leukemias don't believe me type in harvard study because everybody salivates off the name harvard
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:03.040]  and they look at two dozen studies and say it's conclusive this stuff will kill you and and i
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.000]  know i keep saying that every hour because i just had the realization that that's the proof of how
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:14.480]  crazy this is the old timers in the 40s said don't put that in the water this is toxic waste fluoride
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.280]  and it's going to really hurt people shut up crazy man what you're going to nuke the russians you

[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:40.400]  the worst hell and i know you're like alex you said it in the first hour you said it the second
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:48.320]  hour i just marvel that they're killing us and it's fun do you know what industrially is used
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:55.120]  to be sprayed on the crops by crop dusters when it's actually dust and not spray still do you
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:27:00.160]  know what i last time i checked it's the second most sold there's different variants of it but
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:04.960]  if you add them all together you know what the second most popular dust is when they actually
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:14.720]  dust crops do you know what aircraft spray out on crops do you powdered hydrofluorosolic acid
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:18.560]  because it's more psychoactive it's like souped up fluoride
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.000]  by the way they won't believe that type in
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:34.160]  epa sets limits on fluoride as pesticide and they just said last year we recommend this be phased
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:40.400]  out it's real deadly oh yeah the stuff there it is epa proposes phase out of fluoride based

[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:37.040]  well this news has just been breaking the last few days with uh
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:42.000]  john b welles covering on coast to coast am when i first saw this about a week ago i said there's
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:46.480]  no way this is you know this big a whistleblower then i went looked it all up she's in forbes
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:51.360]  uh you name it and well i hope they don't go arrest her in fact uh she's headed to court
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:54.880]  uh reportedly in the next few days we're gonna talk to her in just a moment and then i'm gonna
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:34:00.960]  go back to your calls in overdrive but let me just right now mention a few of these headlines here
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:07.040]  john mccain went met with known al-qaeda rebels he wants more weapons given to him and here's
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:12.880]  rand paul's senate is arming al-qaeda and rushing to war in syria you can read the transcript there
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:20.240]  on the new american magazine here's another one out of foreign policy put out by the washington
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:28.960]  post my colleagues just voted to arm the allies of al-qaeda that's a quote by rand paul people
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:35.280]  are like really also i pointed this out before but now it's been picked up at a bunch of publications
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:41.280]  op-ed says right on gibson guitar is another case of obama targeting conservatives and again
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:47.200]  they're targeting anybody who is a nationalist or anybody that's a populist or anybody who's
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:53.600]  a libertarian they don't target mainline republicans they target people that are actually
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:35:00.320]  patriots because what republicans say a lot of it's true they just betray and don't do it okay
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:05.920]  and again they also been in the past targeted mainline uh you know you know conservatives have
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:10.720]  started to wake up but they've also targeted alternative media liberals that are anti-war and
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:16.400]  stuff and this is what prosecution is when the government comes after you for political views
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:22.960]  that's nazi germany that's how nazi germany started in 33 34 35 36 37 it wasn't till 38
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:28.800]  39 they started arresting everybody and and now they're training with homeland security
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.200]  to go after the american people that's a big deal and i haven't gotten to this yet
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:37.680]  maybe i'll cover it on the nightly news tonight with david knight because it's such a big deal but
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:42.960]  because it's the same global model scotland every child to have a state guardian from birth they're
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:47.440]  like well it's just to make sure the parents aren't bad who watches the government this is
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:54.800]  designed to break up the family this is the globalist plan that's the issue is that they
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:36:00.800]  when the government has you in their custody they put right at 68 percent of foster children u.s
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:08.960]  nationwide number pull it up right at two-thirds of foster children are on an average of seven
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:13.120]  psychotropic drugs because they get more money i've had the foster parents on where they're
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:17.600]  told oh you're the thought the three-year-old yelled we're going to put them on anti-psychotics
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:20.240]  because then it's a special needs child you get more money
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:26.960]  and the eugenicists like it because it attacks the general public i mean this is hellish folks
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:34.080]  what's going on and then if they if they don't get in trouble for all these scandals we're just
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:41.280]  being conditioned to accept it scandal fatigue fast and furious irs gate spy gate all of it
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.960]  vingasi gay and the republican leadership doesn't want to go after them on this because they're all
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:52.000]  connected as well well we need to go after them all of them by the way this is huge we appreciate

[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:57.520]  firsthand what it's uh what it's been like to be a whistleblower inside the world bank
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:04.480]  uh i've been inside the world bank for 20 years and i've been working together with other world
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:10.240]  bank whistleblowers and we've all been you know when you see the elephant and somebody sees the
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:15.360]  trunk and somebody sees the foot well we've got a whole group a whole network of whistleblowers
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:20.240]  and we've been helping each other figure out exactly what what's what and who's doing what
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:24.560]  to whom and by the way i didn't toot your horn properly so folks know who you are uh you're a
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:31.680]  you're a yale uh trained lawyer and you also went to the school of economics at the university of
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:37.120]  amsterdam uh before you worked at the u.s import export bank i won't go over your whole bio but
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.560]  uh and and you've written world bank legal documents legal policy you name it so so you're
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:48.720]  one of the biggest whistleblowers in a long time please go ahead well um what we found out was that
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:55.600]  um there was a lot of corruption going on and the thing about corruption is it's kind of like a
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:02.800]  snowball it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and uh i reported this corruption to the senate
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:09.280]  committee on foreign relations when joe biden was the chair and when hillary clinton and barack
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:14.480]  obama were in the senate on that committee so you tried to do this through channels for a long time
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:22.080]  that's the way you do it um because that way um either they have a chance to solve the problem
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.040]  or you're ready to move on up the ladder and i've been you know i started out in the basement of the
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:35.600]  world bank um you know uh and when i first saw the problem it was in the philippines where uh
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:41.680]  the president of the philippines was corrupt and it was the second largest bank in the philippines
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:47.040]  and the world bank had a project there because there had been the east asia financial crisis
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:55.680]  this was at the end of the 1990s and what happened was um the man who owned philippine airlines
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:02.160]  had borrowed money from this bank and was in default on his loan and what he did was he bought
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:07.680]  the employee shares in philippine national bank and then the loan couldn't be dispersed
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:13.760]  so i said to the man who was in charge of the program in the philippines tell the government
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:19.120]  they're not going to get the money and instead they had me reassigned so what happened was the
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:26.480]  loan um wasn't dispersed for 200 million and then the people who were um depositors in that bank
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:33.920]  took their money out so the government had to bail out the bank for uh 493 million dollars and there
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:41.280]  was another loan from japan for 200 million so in layman's terms it's all designed to fail well
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:47.360]  that's 900 million dollars worth of bad loan it wasn't designed to fail it failed because the
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:55.440]  president of the philippines was corrupt and and then when the world bank evaluated how the loan
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:00.560]  went they said well there was this problem but we couldn't have predicted it the world bank did a
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:07.040]  satisfactory job but i said you've got to be kidding you know there's an evaluation at the
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:14.800]  end of the project uh i said that's a cover-up to the board and that was um the one of the people
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:19.760]  i told that to was i was being interviewed for the job of general counsel and the people that
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:24.960]  were interviewing me that was an executive search firm said why is it that the general counsels
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.760]  is like a revolving door they none of them stay for longer than two years i said because there's
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:36.000]  a cover-up going on inside this organization and the thing about the world bank is it issues bonds
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:43.440]  on the capital market and then it takes the money from the bond and it takes and it invests the money
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:48.960]  and it earns profit and that's how it finances itself every now and then it goes to congress for
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:55.120]  money but most of the time it's earning trading profits sure karen you're the expert on this the
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.440]  reason i bring up the point of giving the third world president or dictator money depending on
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:04.800]  which area it is and then they don't pay it back it's well no they don't pay it back and then that
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:10.720]  signs the country on to perpetual debt they did it's kind of like sending a teenager credit cards
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:14.880]  they can never pay back because you want to get them into debt uh but i mean i mean you were
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:21.520]  inside of it that's why i was saying that it's planned to fail well look sometimes you have a
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:27.040]  good project sometimes you have a country where it's not a teapot dictator and then it's not such
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:32.640]  a bad thing you can um you know if you're going to put your money in a good investment and it's
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:38.480]  going to earn a lot you can pay that loan back so it's you know you can't paint it all with a bad
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:43.520]  brush you can't say anybody that goes to a place like that you can't say anybody that goes to a
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:50.160]  place like that it knows that it's there to um you know snooker the countries and they so anybody
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:55.120]  that sure my point is is that the imf or world bank are more and more known as being being
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:58.720]  predatory and you know joseph stickles has talked about that i mean you probably knew him he was the
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:02.720]  chief economist there at the world bank but okay so so like getting to them i guess what i'm trying
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:07.280]  to say is that there are good people in that place sure sure they're a good project and some
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.880]  of the good people um stood up for what was right and became whistleblowers sure we've been working
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:18.640]  together to turn this thing around because underlying it all um it it doesn't have to
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:25.600]  be a predatory bank um and it i think that it can get us from here to there they're meaning
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:33.120]  a straightforward transparent international financial system where countries can actually
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:40.880]  um turn their situation around oh look i get i mean i get having transparency and nationalizing
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.120]  things or whatever uh obviously these institutions probably could be turning to something good i
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:50.160]  obviously there's good people inside evidence evidenced by you but but for lay folks out there
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:56.000]  explain to the precipice you say we're on and why you've gone public okay i can tell you right now
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:03.280]  we were on a precipice and i'm pretty i'm pretty sure that we've um we're turning the titanic
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:08.400]  around somebody told me that's a bad metaphor because the titanic hits the iceberg but i happen
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:13.520]  to think we've just narrowly missed the iceberg and i think we are turning it around and the
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:21.040]  reason i think that is because i've testified in the uk parliament twice they put my testimony up
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:27.440]  on their website i testified in the european parliament and uh the thing about the world
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:34.160]  bank is it's also a knowledge bank some people that have really good um technical advice go to
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:41.760]  the world bank um and then their advice gets built into the projects and one of these really good um
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:48.960]  pieces of software is uh something they called a stakeholder analysis which um if you get a
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:54.720]  country expert who knows you know exactly what's going on in the country and when i say exactly
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:46:00.960]  what's going on in the country i mean on a given problem they know who's involved in the problem
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.240]  either making it worse or making it better where they stand how powerful they are and if you take
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:12.080]  that information and you put it in a computer game simulation you can get a really good idea
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:18.240]  of where the coalitions are for improving sure but the hedge funds are using these war games
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:22.640]  to bring down countries to consolidate them i mean undoubtedly there's those hyenas involved
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:29.680]  this software i can tell you if you're trying to figure out how to avoid a problem
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:36.240]  it will give you a really good blueprint and i asked these people in 2004 to model
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:44.720]  rule of law and i'll tell you who who designed this um model it's a man by the name of yasik
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:52.960]  kugler he's a professor at the claremont university but he's also um been the president of a number of
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:47:00.880]  political science um analysts you know their their group in any event um i modeled rule of law and
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:08.000]  it told me in 2004 that if the u.s didn't play by the rules we were going to lose the ability
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.040]  to just name the president of the world bank there was going to have to be um an election process so
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:18.000]  that's the u.s losing dominant control of a major system of the world government that's right and
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:25.600]  that's what happened in 2010 but i went to the treasury department in 2006 and i said this model
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:30.720]  is accurate and we better we better straighten ourselves out and we didn't straighten ourselves
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:35.920]  out and then i told you i went to the senate committee on foreign relations and senator luger
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:42.160]  was there he wrote three letters to the world bank saying don't fire this lady and they did anyway
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:49.040]  and i didn't mind actually because i had been there for uh 20 years i had a pension and i just
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.920]  wanted to get the problem solved so i've been working pretty much full time on this problem
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:48:00.400]  i have gone to anybody um who couldn't run away from me fast enough to tell them that we were
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:09.120]  involved in a collision course because after um after i saw this problem looking at it from
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:15.200]  the world bank which is like a microcosm i then read a larger study that was written around the
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:21.120]  same time and it was talking about the world it wasn't talking about the world bank and this said
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:27.840]  that if we didn't start playing by the rules there was going to be a currency war and china was going
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:34.080]  to come up way way fast if we started playing by the rules we would be able to solidify our
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:40.160]  relationship with the um with our allies and what well that's the same thing i'm getting from all
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:46.080]  my pentagon sources is that they and even if they're corrupt they realize that it's going to
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:53.760]  wreck the power uh if they continue to print all this money cheat everybody do all these things and
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:59.200]  so that's why you're seeing such big shake-ups around the world but exactly exactly and so for
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:06.880]  exactly and so for example the people inside the um defense department that were familiar with the
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:15.120]  stakeholder analysis the minute secretary hagel was named i went to the inspector general in the um
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:21.840]  department of defense and i said this model is saying that we have got to clean up our act
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.240]  or we're going to be you know you can read the model as well as i do and the next week
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:32.800]  i got an email from linkedin from the person inside the defense department who had been
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:39.680]  working on that model i had spoken directly to um secretary hagel when he was a senator
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:47.200]  from nebraska yeah so they know the corruption 2008 sure sure so we're gonna go to break this
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:51.280]  is powerful let's come back with that but i'm familiar with this just from my sources they
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:56.720]  realize the snowball of corruption so out of control they can't even control themselves and
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:02.880]  it's going to force everyone to leave the dollar not because they hate america but because it's
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:07.280]  going to destroy them if they don't is that accurate we've turned it around we're not
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:11.920]  leaving the dollar and we'll talk about gold at the other end of your break all right i want to
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:18.080]  hear what you have to say about that uh former world bank insider karen hughes is our guest
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:22.960]  and she certainly uh certainly has a lot of info for us and then and then i was talking during the
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:26.880]  breaks i want to get this straight about whistleblowing about you having some issues with

[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:42.720]  you're going through but the good news of the governor's being aware go ahead okay the
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:51.360]  persecution is very simple um i have to go to a criminal court on the 30th of may eric holder's
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:57.040]  people are there waiting for me the district attorney for the district of columbia and i'm
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:04.400]  charged with trespass which is impossible because the 188 ministers of finance that run the world
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:11.520]  bank wanted me back there so it's trumped up charges and you know that's that's what they're
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:16.000]  trying yeah you were telling me the security firm you know is owned by the globalists so
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:20.960]  that's how crazy it is is is that you go back for a meeting there and then they and then they charge
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:28.800]  you with us that's right well actually what i did was i sent an email to the commissioner of police
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:34.880]  michael reif and i said if you don't think i'm really reinstated you just uh here's the email
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:40.400]  address of the man who's um in charge of the development committee that's the president of
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:47.200]  the national bank of poland or you can ask the dean of the board of executive directors dr uh
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:56.800]  hassan and he didn't do that so he suckered me there and then he handcuffed me and kept me outside
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:02.560]  in his squad car for an hour all right so that's the first part now let me just skip ahead to
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:08.080]  something that everybody ought to know and doesn't know and that is that germany asked for their gold
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:15.600]  back first they asked you know the federal reserve has their gold 300 tons of it and germany asked to
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:23.920]  see it the federal reserve wouldn't let them in and the treasury department sent them a paper audit
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:31.120]  with four pages worth of um you know uh gobbledygook saying uh we think it's there
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:37.440]  and so germany said okay we want our gold back and the federal reserve said germany take a hike
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:44.080]  you can have it maybe in seven years now that's an act of war that's not very good at all and
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:50.160]  that shows how and now they're grabbing people's private bank accounts and now they're mf global
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:56.240]  all of this it shows how precarious everything is well it's not so precarious because i have
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:02.400]  been telling the attorneys general now for two years and what i did was i bought a world bank
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:09.440]  bond i'm a lawyer that means the world bank is not immune and i sued the world bank for securities
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:17.360]  fraud and i sued the auditors of the world bank kpmg because they were cooking the books and what
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:22.480]  happened in court hold on stay there we're back in 60 seconds straight ahead with former world

[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:46.480]  committee of international law section the american bar association and the committee on uh
[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:52.480]  multi-lateralism and accountability the organization of international organizations the american branch
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:57.200]  of international law association this is like a five minute segment long segment coming up and
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:01.760]  i'll reintroduce you for people that just joined us you were getting into germany and i remember
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:07.360]  two years ago my sources saying other countries want their gold germany was listed i was bob
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:14.080]  chapman told me that he's now died about a year ago i think a year ago of this month in uh in uh
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:20.080]  i guess he died in june early june uh but it'll be a year wow but he was saying that from his sources
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:25.360]  but you were you i mean i guess you you knew about this beforehand now that has been in the news
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:32.160]  please continue uh with uh what's going on in the world what's going on in the world is actually
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:39.440]  good news i mean it sounds like we're building up to a huge uh confrontation but the fact of the
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:47.440]  matter is when things get to you know to the last corner people start acting reasonable who haven't
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:55.280]  been reasonable before and uh the governors understand where we're headed that we have a
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:02:03.040]  choice that's either rule of law or a currency war and guess what one rule of law it won and so what
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:08.800]  i expect we're going to be seeing in short order is uh well the first thing that we're going to
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:15.360]  be seeing is that people are going to recognize that the mainstream media is owned by the same
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:23.040]  economic group uh that what business do they have telling us what our news is this story that
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:27.440]  you're hearing from me for the first time it wasn't because i wasn't trying to get through
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:33.200]  to you all it's because there was censorship and so once people recognize that there's censorship
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:39.680]  why should all of your media be owned by these financial interests the the simple answer is that
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:44.800]  it shouldn't be and it won't be that's going to be corrected i've been telling the credit rating
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:52.640]  agencies for the longest time about these problems when there was the election who was
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:58.160]  mitt romney's national security planning chief it was robert zelleck the former president of
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:04.000]  the world bank who was denied a second term because of corruption and so when there was
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:10.080]  the presidential debate iscbs to cover that question i said why don't you ask the candidates
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:15.280]  what they're doing about international corruption there was no question for the voters what kind of
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:20.800]  presidential election is it if there's corruption and the and the media won't tell the the voters
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:26.080]  this is this is a real problem and this problem is now that's the biggest thing i have to tell
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:31.760]  about my whistle-blowing and you're saying the u.s could lose control of the world bank
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:37.200]  excuse me you're saying that the u.s could lose control the world bank
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:43.840]  what i'm saying is that if the u.s doesn't start playing by the rules we are going to lose the
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:49.040]  dollar as an international currency the world bank is a microcosm in the very
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:55.120]  center of the international financial system and if we're not telling our people that we have a
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:04:02.640]  reputation for scoff laws that we don't tell the bondholders what their financial statements are
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:08.080]  this can't continue that's a massive loss of well listen it looks like they're getting ready for the
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:12.640]  loss of confidence and they think paramilitary takeover is going to protect them all i see is
[03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:16.400]  government running around battening down the hatches like it's the end of the world or
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:22.720]  something well here's the point there won't have to be that kind of a shakedown because we have a
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:28.720]  federal system the people who invented our country knew what they were doing oh i know
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:32.640]  absolutely they sure did ma'am stay there i want to hear about this and say talk to me like i'm

[03:08:15.280 --> 03:08:23.040]  is trying to persecute her over this karen hughes ka huge dot net here's her forbes profile
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:29.200]  who is karen hughes she again is from yale law school and also university of amsterdam in
[03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:36.240]  economics she worked as the u.s export import bank on u.s from 1980 85 and then in the legal
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:41.280]  department of the world bank from 86 to 2007 she started blowing the whistle then to congress
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:46.480]  quietly but through channels she established the non-governmental organization committee
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:50.480]  of international law section the american bar association and the committee on multi
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:57.120]  multi-transnationalism and the accountability of international organizations of the american branch
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:04.720]  of the international law association and she joins us now to continue breaking this down
[03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:12.160]  so what is the big picture what's happening with gold what will happen if we lose the
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:20.320]  world dollar reserve currency status and where where is the corruption
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:27.440]  the main centers of corruption right now in the imf and world bank okay i'll answer your last
[03:09:27.440 --> 03:09:33.200]  question first because i'm sure your listeners are saying why should i take this lady's word for it
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:40.240]  uh it's not my word for it there's very accurate data on who owns the transnational company
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:49.680]  40 000 of them and there's a group of mathematicians in switzerland at an institute
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:56.960]  that's the number one university in europe and what they did was they they did a model of that
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:06.480]  of that accurate ownership data and they found out that there's a group of 147 companies and most of
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:16.960]  these are financial institutions and they own 40 of the net worth of the stock market all over
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:25.760]  the world and they own 60 of the earnings but it's not like they uh they have a lot of money
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:30.320]  it's they did it through interlocking corporate directorates in a very clever way in a secret
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:35.840]  way and it's only because those mathematicians were able to model it that they found out that
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:41.280]  guess what all these separate companies because of the interlocking directorates they're all
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:49.120]  actually one conglomerate so you have a world conglomerate of corruption that goes around and
[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:54.560]  they're the ones that own the federal reserve they're the ones that own all of the media now
[03:10:54.560 --> 03:11:02.080]  in the last 20 years the number of owners of the major media in the u.s went from 50 down to five
[03:11:02.080 --> 03:11:07.600]  guess what those five are actually through interlocking directorates they're all one company
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:16.560]  one group so you've got a central what this study calls it is a super entity you have a super entity
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:23.200]  that thinks it can control the world guess what we people are a little smarter than that
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:29.600]  those mathematicians modeled it caught those people with their hands in the cookie jar and
[03:11:30.320 --> 03:11:37.200]  we've been and when i say we it's a group of world bank whistleblowers and we've gone around and we
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:43.520]  have you know we reported the fact that the world bank financial statements are incorrect and the
[03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:49.760]  auditing firm that was supposed to um say whether or not they were uh reliable financial statements
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:58.000]  that was kpmg that's one of the main five auditing firms didn't follow the audit rules so these stocks
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:06.640]  are traded not just in the federal system but don't forget you have the state attorneys general
[03:12:06.640 --> 03:12:14.160]  are responsible for protecting their state investors so the states are now working to solve
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:20.160]  the problem and so we're not going to have a situation where there's you know chaos and and
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:28.160]  whatnot we just we just have the um our states are going to clean up the mess in the federal
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:34.160]  government okay so and and when he was a senator you say you advised hagel of this and many others
[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:38.480]  and we're seeing some evidence they're trying to write this because not out of altruism but
[03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:43.280]  because it will wreck their own system they're already in control of uh the you know the globalist
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:47.600]  brag that they have this combine this group of insiders that are given the free credit that are
[03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:51.680]  given the insider knowledge that are able to manipulate things that are given the loans at
[03:12:51.680 --> 03:12:56.400]  zero percent interest or in some cases even lower and they're establishing this global
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:03.360]  corporatocracy but you're saying that that that you see that the establishment is starting to
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:08.720]  reverse itself but but if this group already has leverage control of everything how is that the
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:14.400]  case because i'm not trying to be pessimistic i hope you're right all i see is militarization
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:20.560]  of police training to take on the people worldwide and a conversion to a collapsed economy with these
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:25.280]  people the only ones that have any of the resources and i see a premeditated program to
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:29.440]  implode the world be the only ones left with resources to then buy everything up for pennies
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:36.240]  on the dollar uh with with kind of a eugenics overlay of social darwinism is the as the
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:42.720]  political rationale that they're doing god's work uh so so what are the signs you say that this has
[03:13:42.720 --> 03:13:48.160]  been turned around and then break down this term that i had never heard of to show my ignorance
[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:57.680]  uh here this uh backwardization okay um i can tell you what signs you can see the fact that
[03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:03.120]  i'm on your program the fact that that your listeners are hearing about it and are they
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:09.360]  going to be sitting on their hands no i hope not they're going to be in touch with their governors
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:13.920]  and they're going to say you get this thing straightened out and i can tell you that i have
[03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:21.920]  had a lot of help and it's just been incredible um and so i'm not i'm not the only one that's
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:30.720]  telling these um corporate uh kleptomaniacs that um no they didn't you know they may have
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:35.440]  had plans for it but it was nipped in the bud they were caught with their hand in the cookie jar
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:43.280]  and it's not happening and it's not happening in the biggest way uh and i mean it's not like
[03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:48.080]  the listeners can just sort of sit back and say okay the problem solved no you're part of the
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:54.640]  solution you you know you stay tuned you figure out what's going on you you get active you work
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:59.360]  together with all right well what are the signs what are the signs you're saying that there are
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:05.280]  insane parts of the establishment uh trying to reverse this and trying to secure the dollars
[03:15:05.280 --> 03:15:12.160]  world reserve currency status okay um you'll see it for example in uh one of these bills
[03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:17.040]  that the mega banks are going to have to pay more money they're going to have to have stronger
[03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:22.560]  reserves because they're too big to fail so they've got to have a bigger capital requirement
[03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:27.440]  that's um a proposal from i'm trying to remember the show you think the wall street journal's
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:32.320]  right the bernanke's out in august and they're going to raise interest rates i don't know about
[03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:37.520]  when bernanke's out but i can tell you that i've been writing to the federal reserve because
[03:15:37.520 --> 03:15:42.560]  bernanke is on something called the national advisory council on international monetary and
[03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:49.440]  financial policies that's that's a big um long name but basically what that is is that uh the
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:54.960]  secretary of the treasury heads that that's coordination with other governments there is
[03:15:54.960 --> 03:16:00.480]  a lot of coordination with other governments i i was up all night last night sending faxes
[03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:07.920]  to all of the 188 ministers of finance that run the world bank to give them an update uh
[03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:12.640]  on this they're you know they've they've been aware of this problem they've seen it coming
[03:16:12.640 --> 03:16:18.480]  and they wanted me to try to rally the troops and so you're saying after after six years of
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:24.320]  whistleblowing you're starting to see signs that show the establishment gets it which i would think
[03:16:24.320 --> 03:16:30.000]  is sane i don't get destroying the world's system to get power when these people are already in
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:36.480]  power i mean it's just pure nastiness pure craziness a bunch of hedge fund hyena guys
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:41.600]  leveraging trillions worth tens of billions of piece like jamie diamond and all of them trying
[03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:47.360]  to show off to one another you know that they've got 50 jet copters and you've only got 30 meanwhile
[03:16:47.360 --> 03:16:53.360]  there's no civilization i mean is that what you're saying is that you're seeing signs that sanity is
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:17:01.120]  entering the building yes absolutely i mean these guys instead of wearing their status as the ceo
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:09.040]  in this network of control as a sign of um great uh esteem these guys are going to be seen for what
[03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:16.240]  they really are crux no i think we're i think we're in good shape actually um i'm i'm i'm just
[03:17:16.240 --> 03:17:22.480]  going to start really enjoying to see how these people are brought down to earth with the rest
[03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:27.520]  of us they're not above the law the law is there and you know one of the one of the points i wanted
[03:17:27.520 --> 03:17:33.680]  to make is that um it's not like we're talking about world government we're talking about just
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:40.560]  the opposite the one thing that we're going to have is we're going to have world um rationality
[03:17:40.560 --> 03:17:47.040]  we're going to have law applying to these crooks that thought they were going to um get away with
[03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:52.400]  it well ma'am i'm no i'm no economist and harvard lawyer like you but i do try to study this and
[03:17:52.400 --> 03:17:57.440]  i talk to a lot of the world's experts and i really find what you say to be pretty accurate
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:18:01.200]  from some of the things i'm saying what i think is going on here is there's a battle
[03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:08.320]  over the future and are we going to let these crazy arrogant private central bankers and hedge
[03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:14.320]  fund people really melt down our whole future just so they can you know run everything when
[03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:20.960]  they already run everything uh but but what's going on with gold then or i mean are are we
[03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:26.880]  going to see prosecution of these people or will we just see them basically you know sent to
[03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:32.800]  abstentia or or you know like napoleon or something well the first thing we're going to see
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:38.560]  is um and the reason why we're all coming together on this now is because we were going to run out
[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:47.760]  of time the the thing about gold backwardization is that um people who have gold will not sell it
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:55.360]  for paper money because the paper money doesn't seem to be trustworthy and the first reason why
[03:18:55.360 --> 03:19:02.800]  the dollar wouldn't be seen to be trustworthy is because we've got these fake accountant audits
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:09.920]  that aren't following the accounting rules uh there there are a number of whistleblowers inside
[03:19:09.920 --> 03:19:17.040]  the world bank who saw that the uh the numbers weren't adding up and when they reported it
[03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:23.680]  they would get thrown out with no recourse so if that happens inside a banking institution
[03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:31.440]  you can't rely on the financial information and so that means that all the regulators in the world
[03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:37.680]  have got a crackdown and so what you're going to have is you're not going to have one central place
[03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:44.960]  that's going to run the world but you're going to have all of the different local places the state
[03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:53.120]  applying the same rule but being able to do that all together because of the flow of information
[03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:59.520]  and so what what i've had now and the other world whistleblowers have had is we've seen for example
[03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:07.840]  the uk parliament is now helping these the governors crack down on these illegal um
[03:20:08.800 --> 03:20:14.240]  financial sure and and and i mean iceland's thrown them out as well but then i see the acceleration of
[03:20:14.240 --> 03:20:19.760]  looting of bank accounts in cyprus in places some would argue that was actually robbing the the
[03:20:19.760 --> 03:20:24.000]  bureaucrats money that had already been robbed as well some people even claimed that was like
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:30.800]  a reverse robbery but um let me ask you this question then i don't see these globalists
[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:34.720]  turning loose of power i think they're too dangerous to not be locked up i understand
[03:20:34.720 --> 03:20:37.760]  there's also a danger in running them to ground because then they're cornered but
[03:20:37.760 --> 03:20:44.480]  i mean i don't see these people ever giving up it's kind of like uh corzine making 30 to 140 to 1 bets
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:51.200]  with other people's money that were dangerous bets to begin with so their arrogance is their
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:55.360]  undoing but also makes them that much more dangerous and i understand there's a lot of
[03:20:55.360 --> 03:21:00.800]  people you talk to that are listening to you in the system but i don't i don't see these globalist
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:07.920]  these new world order people i don't see them giving up i i mean i i just i just don't see the proof
[03:21:07.920 --> 03:21:13.520]  of sanity i mean are you saying maybe all these scandals coming out and congress growing somewhat
[03:21:13.520 --> 03:21:19.120]  of a spinal cord uh and actually are doing some real investigations now is that a sign of what's
[03:21:19.120 --> 03:21:25.280]  happening i'll tell you what i think is going to be the mechanism for the transformation it's going
[03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:32.560]  to be the transparency and the flow of information and so you're going to see scandals you're going
[03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:38.480]  to see these people shamed it's not so much i mean i i can't speak so you're saying a flood
[03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:44.960]  i'm saying this a flood of whistleblowers who think they can't get us all if we all start flooding
[03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:50.000]  info so instead of meeting in the parking garage because everything's spied on everybody start
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:55.120]  whistleblowing that would bring them down that's exactly what's happening that's exactly the
[03:21:55.120 --> 03:22:01.040]  mechanism and in terms of how this is going to work with um the fiat currency which is the paper
[03:22:01.040 --> 03:22:08.320]  money versus money which is backed by precious metals or um i've also you know recently been
[03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:14.000]  talking to a number of people who think that uh there's also going to be commodities that are worth
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:23.280]  um you know markets uh like oil or uh coal or other other um commodities will also back
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:29.040]  currency so that um it's not just going to be precious metals because the thing is if you just
[03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:34.000]  stick to the precious metals the people who now have the precious metals are going to be um
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:38.640]  they're going to have a leg up it's not fair so there's going to be in other words there's going
[03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:47.440]  to be a transition where the strong money is going to um start to replace the paper currency
[03:22:47.440 --> 03:22:53.120]  but it's not going to be like um the paper currency goes out of uh circulation from one
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:58.240]  minute to the next it's not going to be abrupt and just the same way we're not going to have
[03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:03.600]  automatically good rule of law we're not going to automatically have people paying more attention
[03:23:03.600 --> 03:23:10.400]  to ethics than um you know uh survival of the fittest in the marketplace we're gonna we're
[03:23:10.400 --> 03:23:15.120]  gonna all pull ourselves up by our bootstraps well i agree with you everything's in a process
[03:23:15.120 --> 03:23:21.920]  either we shift back towards rule of law transparency uh stability freedom or we keep
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:25.920]  going down this path but they're gonna have to bring in total tyranny under their plan because
[03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:31.440]  everyone not just mathematicians is going to know the the bureaucrats are exempt the bankers are
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:36.480]  exempt the head of ge's exempt google's exempt from taxes we're seeing whistleblowers out of
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:42.240]  google a high level as you pointed out you're going public so i am seeing as people realize
[03:23:42.240 --> 03:23:47.520]  we're all screwed if we don't beat these people it's us or them but if we don't beat them they're
[03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:51.760]  going to go all the way because they're going to have to have a total tyranny in a system where
[03:23:51.760 --> 03:23:56.640]  everybody knows they're above the law and that they stole their wealth i mean the justice will
[03:23:56.640 --> 03:24:02.560]  be served they are not going to get away with it they are blowing up society so they can be in
[03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:09.120]  charge of it none of us should put up with that and we're not it's not happening and i think they
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:14.320]  already know that i mean this this stakeholder analysis that i was talking about i mean it's
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:22.240]  really um it's pretty clear that either there's going to be um rule of law or there's going to be
[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:26.800]  a system where we have to go back to the middle ages because there won't be any way to finance
[03:24:26.800 --> 03:24:31.040]  trade wow you really know what you're talking about and that's what they want the bilderberg
[03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:35.200]  group for 50 years says they're going to do this and then we're going to go back to feudalism and
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:42.880]  they're going to be like in um elysium bases but on the ground and on ships that's crazy that's not
[03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:50.720]  happening it's not happening wow i'm really impressed with you uh and i and i just it's so
[03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:54.800]  good to know there's all these whistleblowers and thank god that john b wells got young that's a big
[03:24:54.800 --> 03:24:59.440]  show with about six million listeners a night and i hope our listeners get your info we've only got
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:03.760]  a minute or two left i want to get you back on i know you're facing all this whistleblower
[03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:09.840]  persecution but uh you've got a lot of great info on your website for people to visit anything else
[03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:16.720]  you'd like to impart to the listeners no just um hang in there be part of the process to get
[03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:22.480]  ourselves um back in shape and again i just want to emphasize that we've got a federal government
[03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:28.880]  and our states are alive and well thank you well i mean if the federal government wasn't training
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:33.440]  to fight veterans all day i would think that's true but you're saying you know federal government
[03:25:33.440 --> 03:25:38.560]  people you know what i don't mean the federal government is good i mean we have a federal system
[03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:44.880]  and the states are good well listen i agree with that but but expanding on that um i think the
[03:25:44.880 --> 03:25:50.160]  i think the system's overshot when they go and say prepare to wage war with the american people
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:54.640]  and the biggest enemy or are people that want to you know abolish the federal reserve i think it's
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:59.920]  really woken the the military and police up that they actually are training them for war with us
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:07.200]  i mean i think they've gone too far i don't think there's going to be anything close to a war with
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:13.600]  us because as i said once more we have our local government we have our state government those
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:21.120]  governments are ours and they're not going anywhere we're fine we're in good shape i hope
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:25.440]  you're right i hope you're right but i mean certainly you see you know being at the world
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:29.760]  bank and the imf also had the plan when they imploded economies so they went south you know
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:35.360]  the imf riot model they are gearing up the oligarchs think the kleptocratic oligarchs
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:40.720]  the kleptogarks that's been a new word the kleptogarks uh think they're really going to
[03:26:40.720 --> 03:26:45.360]  make it or or more and more i do see them running scared in their actions are you saying they
[03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:51.840]  figured out they're going to lose they lost already the only question is if they try to
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:57.520]  make it a painful transition they're going to be in worse shape than they're in already
[03:26:58.320 --> 03:27:04.320]  they they hold their own future in their own hands and they can be reasonable and just go
[03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:10.160]  with the flow and and be subject to the law like the rest of us and enjoy it it's really going to
[03:27:10.160 --> 03:27:16.880]  be a better world i hope you're right but i'll tell you we were sitting on a time bomb this
[03:27:16.880 --> 03:27:20.400]  isn't turned around quick you think that turned around is what i'm trying to tell you
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:28.480]  well i hope you're right i think i'm right when did it start turning around
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:37.520]  that's a good question um i'm just now starting to get caught up with some of i mean i'll just
[03:27:37.520 --> 03:27:43.520]  name a couple of names all right um there's this really uh neat national security whistleblower
[03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:52.000]  named mark novitsky uh and he he educated me on a lot of the um uh you know the internal spying what
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:28:01.920]  was going on and i mean when you've got that kind of um person who's helping and informing everybody
[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:08.640]  else it's like we just reinforce each other and so i just have every every bit of confidence that
[03:28:08.640 --> 03:28:14.960]  um you know we know where the system is gained and it's not like one of us knows it we all know it
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:19.360]  because we've all shared this so the cat's out of the bag people are now aware of the program
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:23.760]  and then once people realize that there can be evil going on then they start to recognize all
[03:28:23.760 --> 03:28:31.040]  of it and i do see the sleeping giant awakening right now i do that's exactly the point and then
[03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:35.920]  once we're not naive anymore we can recognize it and then that begins the healing process or the
[03:28:35.920 --> 03:28:40.960]  bankers set off a nuke in chicago and bring in martial law but you know i think now that people
[03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:46.160]  know the type of stuff they can pull that doesn't have the same power anymore our only big problem
[03:28:46.160 --> 03:28:49.600]  is they've got all the churches working for the government saying it's the end of the world so
[03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:54.880]  all the christians stand down so it's serious fight i want to say bye to you during this break
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:28:59.920]  i want to invite you back on later in the week after your court date for your evil crimes and
