[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30.000 --> 00:55.200]  We're live, my friends. It is the 23rd day of June 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones,
[00:55.200 --> 01:02.600]  and we are going to be live here for the next few hours as we are every single Sunday. And
[01:02.600 --> 01:09.360]  of course, we come back weekdays live 11 to two central as well. I have absolutely spent
[01:09.360 --> 01:16.440]  hours Friday and yesterday on Saturday and today thinking about the things I want to
[01:16.440 --> 01:19.460]  say here today.
[01:19.460 --> 01:23.680]  And I've probably said this 100 times in just the last few years when I started broadcast,
[01:23.680 --> 01:30.140]  and I've never really succeeded in getting in that quiet, focused place. And then just
[01:30.140 --> 01:37.120]  presenting the real essence of what's going on to everybody so that we can understand
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.680]  what we're facing as a culture and a society.
[01:41.680 --> 01:47.640]  So when we start the next segment, I will start plowing into the first big report that
[01:47.640 --> 01:56.680]  I want to get into. The case of Michael Hastings, the associate editor of Rolling Stone magazine,
[01:56.680 --> 02:08.240]  who had recently been planning to release a lot of really powerful
[02:08.240 --> 02:16.120]  information concerning General Petraeus, the CIA, NSA, you name it. He was working on all
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.280]  of it.
[02:19.280 --> 02:32.200]  So we're going to be getting into all of that today and the fact that hiding in plain view
[02:32.200 --> 02:39.920]  on Friday, the TV stations in LA and then the LA Times were forced to report on what
[02:39.920 --> 02:46.000]  WikiLeaks and then everybody else in the real media was talking about on Wednesday and Thursday.
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.780]  And that is that Hastings said that he was going into hiding and that he was being followed
[02:53.780 --> 03:00.280]  by the FBI, that they were harassing his friends and family.
[03:00.280 --> 03:07.600]  Now the fact that they've had a bunch of old dinosaur media and then other fake alternative
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.400]  media come out and make fun of people, New York Daily News, New York Magazine, Daily
[03:13.400 --> 03:23.660]  Caller come out and say, look at the crazies. They're saying that he could have been murdered.
[03:23.660 --> 03:34.400]  It would be surprising if he was not murdered with all of this evidence. And how would you
[03:34.400 --> 03:41.120]  have someone who's reporting on big national security stories and who is exposing top generals
[03:41.120 --> 03:43.760]  and people are losing their jobs over it?
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.880]  And then he comes out on television and says we should release all the NSA data. We should
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.040]  have the press stop complying with this corrupt government. He said that about a week before
[03:52.040 --> 04:00.680]  his car blew up. And I've looked at the evidence, it looks like a car bomb. But even that particular
[04:00.680 --> 04:06.400]  model of Mercedes is absolutely remote controllable and that's in Car and Driver.
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.240]  I'm going to be showing you that news where they could drive him at 100 miles an hour
[04:11.240 --> 04:17.320]  into the tree. Except I've seen what the eyewitnesses said of the explosion and how it basically
[04:17.320 --> 04:26.140]  came up to rest up against the tree, not really into the tree. But it's a bigger issue here.
[04:26.140 --> 04:33.580]  Not that the establishment kills people, but that the media is so compliant in going along
[04:33.580 --> 04:38.800]  with this and then criticizing people. I mean, you'd be crazy to not look at a murder investigation
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.300]  and not look at it being foul play. But day one, they said no foul play, which is always
[04:43.300 --> 04:48.320]  another big telltale sign. We've got that big story. We've got police busting people's
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.920]  houses over three inch grass in their yards. We've got the latest geopolitically and the
[04:54.920 --> 04:59.200]  latest on Snowden planning to go to Ecuador.

[06:22.040 --> 06:45.040]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here live and then I come back
[06:45.040 --> 06:53.000]  Sundays live and we're live 4 to 6 p.m. also Central Standard Time and I want to thank
[06:53.000 --> 07:09.040]  you for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast. The 23rd day of June 2013. All right, we are
[07:09.040 --> 07:18.040]  going to try to cover a lot of ground here today looking at what the kleptocratic establishment
[07:18.040 --> 07:28.080]  is up to and ways that humanity is trying to awaken itself and also organize against
[07:28.080 --> 07:42.680]  all of this tyranny. But I really want today to try to calmly go over this news and information
[07:42.680 --> 07:51.360]  and really have the listeners take notes whether they be physical or mental and to go follow
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.760]  along either today or tomorrow or tonight whenever you have time with the information
[07:56.760 --> 08:02.120]  I'm going to present here so that you can discover for yourself how much trouble we're
[08:02.120 --> 08:11.120]  in. The United States is a very wealthy powerful country because we've had more liberty and
[08:11.120 --> 08:16.220]  freedom than other nations. That does not mean that we were some paragon of justice
[08:16.220 --> 08:21.720]  but compared to most other nations, we have empowered the middle class, we have empowered
[08:21.720 --> 08:28.360]  the individual. But because of that, we became the most powerful nation on earth and then
[08:28.360 --> 08:36.880]  corrupt influences moved in to capitalize on that power and wealth. And now as tyranny
[08:36.880 --> 08:43.320]  takes hold and as crony monopoly systems take hold in government interfacing with major
[08:43.320 --> 08:50.680]  offshore corporations, we see the justice and the liberty and along with that, the prosperity
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.440]  exiting very, very quickly.
[08:52.440 --> 09:04.280]  And we have a mix of malaise, general naivete in the public that mixed with high check propaganda
[09:04.280 --> 09:15.360]  and complexity in government is a recipe for allowing government tyranny to grow to a level
[09:15.360 --> 09:21.320]  that has never before been seen on the face of this globe. And make no mistake, no historian
[09:21.320 --> 09:26.200]  would disagree with you. I challenge you to find one that would if you make the point
[09:26.200 --> 09:33.600]  that government has been the greatest non-natural killer of masses of people in history.
[09:33.600 --> 09:38.960]  University of Hawaii did a study a few years ago and found that conservatively government
[09:38.960 --> 09:49.120]  in the 20th century alone in the 100 years preceding 2001. If you look at the previous
[09:49.120 --> 09:59.080]  100 years, government confirmed killed 262 million people, men, women and children that
[09:59.080 --> 10:00.280]  were non-military deaths.
[10:00.280 --> 10:06.440]  I'm not talking about people dying and the fire bombing of Dresden, Germany or the fragmentation
[10:06.440 --> 10:13.240]  bombing of London, vice versa. I'm talking about government lining people up and shooting
[10:13.240 --> 10:19.720]  them or working them to death in death camps. And so my great concern being a novice historian
[10:19.720 --> 10:24.840]  and someone who's into common sense is that we're taught that government is like mommy's
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.800]  milk and the best thing since air conditioning.
[10:29.800 --> 10:36.480]  And that all it can do is good for us and that anybody that questions it is a traitor.
[10:36.480 --> 10:47.040]  If you go up to infowars.com today, there is an Anthony Frieda graphic on the front
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.320]  page in the featured news area and it's a giant Uncle Sam hand pointing down to a man
[10:52.320 --> 10:59.660]  on the plane. And he says, I think we should restore the rule of law and bill of rights.
[10:59.660 --> 11:04.040]  Stop waging illegal wars and stop illegal surveillance of American citizens. That's
[11:04.040 --> 11:06.080]  what the man is saying, the American.
[11:06.080 --> 11:14.400]  Uncle Sam is pointing his finger saying, extremist. And that's not satire at all. That's actually
[11:14.400 --> 11:23.040]  what the system does. You see, once a country starts putting up with corruption and once
[11:23.040 --> 11:29.500]  corruption takes hold and becomes the economy. And once the mafia system of government and
[11:29.500 --> 11:32.440]  and gangs gets in place.
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.440]  And once the crime is inculcated into the culture, like a too big to fail for the offshore
[11:38.440 --> 11:45.140]  banks that run our country by design into the ground. Once they can sell you on we're
[11:45.140 --> 11:53.240]  too big to fail, you can't remove us. The cancer has metastasized, embrace the cancer.
[11:53.240 --> 12:01.920]  Once we get to that point, there is probably no coming back. And the corrupt hordes of
[12:01.920 --> 12:11.320]  people on the dole, people with corporate welfare, government and then all the accompanying
[12:11.320 --> 12:19.760]  bureaucracies of groups that have scores to settle and different clicks and groups that
[12:19.760 --> 12:27.880]  are allied with the power structure. They will go out and feed on and abuse and hunt
[12:27.880 --> 12:30.420]  down the good and virtuous.
[12:30.420 --> 12:36.280]  That's how tyranny works. Because the good and virtuous won't organize and get together
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.960]  and defend themselves generally. And they can't even imagine the tyranny because their
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.760]  brains don't work like that. They have no autoimmune system to it. And the power structure
[12:46.760 --> 12:53.180]  will demonize groups as things begin to contract to rob them.
[12:53.180 --> 13:00.920]  It isn't that you'll even resist them. It isn't that the system will come after you
[13:00.920 --> 13:08.840]  because you fight against them. It will come after you because you're not part of a crew.
[13:08.840 --> 13:13.060]  You're not part of a gang. You're not part of a power structure. This is how the world
[13:13.060 --> 13:18.520]  has always worked. Our founders said, we'll get the middle class together, organized with
[13:18.520 --> 13:23.920]  weapons and have rules that we will absolutely go after any big government that tries to
[13:23.920 --> 13:26.120]  violate any of these basic rights.
[13:26.120 --> 13:32.360]  Because we've seen throughout history that when they go after these rights, hell follows.
[13:32.360 --> 13:38.840]  So it was about a gang of liberty, a gang of freedom, a gang of independence, a gang
[13:38.840 --> 13:45.480]  of the individual. That we the individuals would band together when people tried to form
[13:45.480 --> 13:51.800]  gangs to come feed on us. But we were taught it was sexy and cool not to wanna be part
[13:51.800 --> 13:53.000]  of the liberty gang.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.880]  We were taught it was sexy and cool to be corrupt. We were taught that that's how you
[13:56.880 --> 14:00.240]  got ahead, by not caring about your neighbors, by not caring about anybody in the society
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.940]  but yourself. We were taught that laughing at people that warn about big government and
[14:05.940 --> 14:13.640]  warn about the Bill of Rights and Constitution was somehow a shield against tyranny.
[14:13.640 --> 14:19.920]  We were sold cultural death. We don't have a culture in America. What, you think football's
[14:19.920 --> 14:25.160]  our culture? You think acting tough's the culture or acting trendy's the culture? People
[14:25.160 --> 14:33.440]  regurgitate and reflect what the culture put out by Hollywood, which is a weaponized culture,
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.360]  which is a system to where you don't really have a culture.
[14:37.360 --> 14:46.320]  And if you have no culture and you stand for nothing, you will fall for anything. And we're
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.680]  at that historic crossroads, I've got big news coming up after the break. Where either
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.260]  the corruption all comes out in the open as it is because it's emerging, it's taking over,
[14:58.260 --> 15:10.660]  it's metastasizing, and we reject it. Our body beats the cancer. We vomit out the poison.
[15:10.660 --> 15:16.640]  Or if we tell ourselves, no, this isn't poison, and we don't take measures against it, we
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.800]  will surely die as a republic. And it will happen very quickly. We're not talking about
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.520]  your children's time now. We've been saying that for 20 years. Now it is the time of your
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.780]  children, the time that they've grown up and their children.
[15:30.780 --> 15:35.720]  And so all the rot you've seen the last 100 years or so under the Federal Reserve governorship,
[15:35.720 --> 15:41.100]  the foreign banking cartel, all of the rot you've seen will now be doubled just the next
[15:41.100 --> 15:45.480]  three or four years, and then doubled again and doubled again. We've gone off the cliff,
[15:45.480 --> 15:51.500]  folks. We're off the cliff now. We're in free fall. I'm gonna break down absolute evidence
[15:51.500 --> 16:00.960]  of American whistleblowers and media people being exterminated by Obama NDAA death squads.
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.740]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[16:05.740 --> 16:11.420]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[16:11.420 --> 16:17.020]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[16:17.020 --> 16:21.320]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really
[16:21.320 --> 16:26.980]  be a problem? eFoodsDirect has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad

[20:01.500 --> 20:12.700]  to coast, direct from Austin. You are listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. I
[20:12.700 --> 20:20.500]  have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind
[20:20.500 --> 20:32.100]  of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Alright ladies and
[20:32.100 --> 20:38.860]  gentlemen we are back live. Coming up I'm going to get into the Edward Snowden situation.
[20:38.860 --> 20:46.060]  Going to Russia and then he's planning to hop a plane to another South American country
[20:46.060 --> 20:51.900]  hoping to try to get some type of political asylum there. We're going to be breaking that
[20:51.900 --> 20:58.780]  down in the next segment and the responses of the establishment saying this guy's a traitor.
[20:58.780 --> 21:04.760]  The people that are engaged in the spying against the American people are the ones that
[21:04.760 --> 21:10.460]  are breaking the law. We're going to be going over that. In fact, I have known someone that
[21:10.460 --> 21:17.660]  worked for Air Force Intelligence and the NSA for about 15 years. I know him very well.
[21:17.660 --> 21:24.340]  He's a good friend of mine and he also worked on the Apollo program. You can see him there.
[21:24.340 --> 21:28.660]  He's been on the show before. You can see him in the Apollo program on the very front
[21:28.660 --> 21:36.060]  line. He was one of the main mission controllers and he came by the office. He's 71 years old.
[21:36.060 --> 21:43.420]  He came by the office Thursday. He's agreed to come on in a few weeks and not about NSA,
[21:43.420 --> 21:47.780]  but he said I'll tell you this and he had trouble even saying that. He said there was
[21:47.780 --> 21:56.980]  150,000 analysts in DC alone when I was involved in it in the 70s. The last time he was involved
[21:56.980 --> 22:01.780]  there, and I've known this guy forever, and he was having trouble saying it, and he goes,
[22:01.780 --> 22:07.660]  and they said they will kill anyone at the graduations at the Air Force and then another
[22:07.660 --> 22:08.660]  one.
[22:08.660 --> 22:13.140]  Anyone that talks will be killed. So that's why Snowden came out. It's Raymond Teague.
[22:13.140 --> 22:16.500]  He was here Thursday, in case anything happens to Raymond, but he's not going to give out
[22:16.500 --> 22:22.740]  any NSA secrets. We know what you're doing. And he was just talking about everything.
[22:22.740 --> 22:28.780]  Snowden was just in printouts with computers and then analysts listening and it being typed
[22:28.780 --> 22:35.620]  out in just sheets to be sent off to other people. And it was everything. It was, he
[22:35.620 --> 22:39.700]  said, narcotics trafficking. He said that all the analysts knew the government ran almost
[22:39.700 --> 22:43.060]  all the drugs and that you just weren't supposed to say anything.
[22:43.060 --> 22:46.820]  You just sat there and they had the analysts listening, typing it all out and then it was
[22:46.820 --> 22:56.220]  and teletypes being sent off. 150,000 analysts in DC alone. By the way, Raymond was in a
[22:56.220 --> 23:02.300]  meeting with, well, John Bowne, you were in the meeting. Yeah, turn your microphone on,
[23:02.300 --> 23:04.420]  tell people about it. You were in there?
[23:04.420 --> 23:07.500]  Yeah, I just sat in awe what this guy was saying.
[23:07.500 --> 23:10.820]  And by the way, I've been to his house and everything and he's got the national security
[23:10.820 --> 23:16.780]  letters all over the wall. He's got a presidential medal. Anyways, we'll get into it more later.
[23:16.780 --> 23:21.660]  The point is, it's unbelievable. And Raymond would never really tell me much about this.
[23:21.660 --> 23:27.140]  He said, well, this is in the 70s and I'm not giving you specifics, but absolutely.
[23:27.140 --> 23:34.680]  And I've known people in the modern NSA. Well, you've heard them on here as guests. And so
[23:34.680 --> 23:41.860]  it's so naive when Snowden comes out and says that they're gonna try to kill me last week
[23:41.860 --> 23:50.100]  and the media's like, preposterous, that's ridiculous. No one would try to kill anybody.
[23:50.100 --> 23:59.220]  And then the Daily Mail was in the Dulles Airport outside Chantilly, Virginia, named
[23:59.220 --> 24:04.780]  after the former head of the CIA and heard a bunch of analysts and CIA bragging in the
[24:04.780 --> 24:12.140]  concourse of how we need to kill this guy. I mean, I've had people with access to NSA
[24:12.140 --> 24:16.660]  stuff haul up many times, my wife and I, tell us what we're talking about to try to freak
[24:16.660 --> 24:18.080]  us out.
[24:18.080 --> 24:22.520]  And then go into talking about how they're gonna kill us. I mean, that's what the government
[24:22.520 --> 24:32.620]  does with this. This has happened to me. Okay, I have lived it. I have experienced it. And
[24:32.620 --> 24:37.940]  people are so incredibly naive. And by the way, you better learn who set up the CIA,
[24:37.940 --> 24:39.540]  the British intelligence.
[24:39.540 --> 24:44.220]  You better learn this country since about 1923 with the Council on Foreign Relations
[24:44.220 --> 24:49.980]  that was openly British intelligence. Look it up, Pratt Street, New York. That's on record
[24:49.980 --> 24:54.200]  to take over the US government with money and finance and corporate dollars. And then
[24:54.200 --> 25:02.780]  you look at the CIA being set up out of the OSS in 47.
[25:02.780 --> 25:07.140]  And then you look at what's come out in congressional hearings. It's not like, it's my opinion the
[25:07.140 --> 25:12.060]  CIA brings in most of the narcotics or oversees it for the big banks. The big banks got caught
[25:12.060 --> 25:20.340]  last year laundering $378 billion, two banks alone, Wachovia and Wells Fargo.
[25:20.340 --> 25:25.860]  And I mean, that was in AP in Reuters in Bloomberg. I've probably read that on air 50 times to
[25:25.860 --> 25:32.420]  you. And they didn't get in trouble. They actually ran the aircraft. These companies
[25:32.420 --> 25:37.500]  run the weapons, all of it. I mean, where do you think a trillion dollars a year in
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.780]  narcotics money goes?
[25:39.780 --> 25:43.780]  Half of it, the money's North America. Yeah, there it is, banks financing Mexican gangs
[25:43.780 --> 25:53.620]  admitted in Wells Fargo deal Bloomberg. You know how frustrating it is to know that I
[25:53.620 --> 26:00.780]  can go to a family reunion and there'll be a whole bunch of retired people who worked
[26:00.780 --> 26:02.380]  in black projects.
[26:02.380 --> 26:05.980]  And it's not like my family special. This is probably the biggest corporation in the
[26:05.980 --> 26:12.140]  world. It's just all, it's the company. It is, it's all a big joke. And by the way, they're
[26:12.140 --> 26:18.180]  not looking out for America's interest. We are seen as idiots, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:18.180 --> 26:21.860]  I mean, you can argue that the government did corrupt stuff 50, 60, 70 years ago to
[26:21.860 --> 26:26.660]  beat other bad guys. But then that stuff doesn't end when the war is over. They use narcotics
[26:26.660 --> 26:30.740]  trafficking and opium in and out of Sicily to undermine the Nazis.
[26:30.740 --> 26:39.500]  Of course, those contacts didn't end at the end of World War II. It's on record they brought
[26:39.500 --> 26:47.220]  in the opium inside the bodies of dead soldiers. Tons of it, the heroin, the opium to be turned
[26:47.220 --> 26:52.780]  into heroin. And it's the naivete. And then I think about Aaron Schwartz, who got engaged
[26:52.780 --> 26:57.420]  with fiance said, I'm gonna beat this federal case claiming I hacked when all I did was
[26:57.420 --> 27:03.820]  give out public info from MIT leading the moves to, he's really the leader of anonymous
[27:03.820 --> 27:04.820]  folks.
[27:04.820 --> 27:11.860]  That's who he was. And that's come out of the real anonymous. And he was beating SOPA
[27:11.860 --> 27:15.980]  and SISPA and organizing people and was a genius. And they went to his apartment and
[27:15.980 --> 27:20.380]  hung him and then said, the government drove him to death. He was saying I'm gonna beat
[27:20.380 --> 27:28.300]  this 35 years in prison for releasing public data that the public paid for.
[27:28.300 --> 27:34.580]  I'm gonna beat this and I'm getting married. They hung him. The DC madam was on my show
[27:34.580 --> 27:38.340]  and was saying, I'm keeping all this info I know, so they don't mess with me. And I
[27:38.340 --> 27:43.180]  said to her on there, I said, they're gonna kill you. You either tell them you're not
[27:43.180 --> 27:44.860]  gonna use the data, release it.
[27:44.860 --> 27:50.900]  She goes, well, how do I tell them? I said, you talk over the telephone, they're listening.
[27:50.900 --> 27:56.540]  And I mean, she's servicing all the top people there in DC. And I said, that doesn't protect
[27:56.540 --> 28:00.460]  you, that's gonna get you killed. They killed her a month later. She said, I'll never commit
[28:00.460 --> 28:02.020]  suicide.
[28:02.020 --> 28:06.420]  Pat Tillman wrote home, said that we're shipping the opium out. Our government runs al-Qaeda.
[28:06.420 --> 28:10.460]  I'm gonna go public. His brothers talked about it. And they killed him. And it was General
[28:10.460 --> 28:15.540]  McChrystal that ran the cover up and probably gave the orders.
[28:15.540 --> 28:23.740]  And it was Michael Hastings, the associate editor of the Rolling Stone, that went and
[28:23.740 --> 28:32.100]  told them, yeah, this is off record, and then burned McChrystal. Burn McChrystal. And well,
[28:32.100 --> 28:39.420]  I guess McChrystal burned him. Or somebody did, because his car got blown sky high.
[28:39.420 --> 28:42.740]  All the witnesses said, he's driving down the street, just blows up. An engine shot
[28:42.740 --> 28:47.380]  60 yards. And then it turns out he calls family, he goes, I'm on the run, they're after me.
[28:47.380 --> 28:48.380]  I'm going into hiding.
[28:48.380 --> 28:52.580]  I feel like if I said, I'm going into hiding, they're after me at the end of the show. And
[28:52.580 --> 28:57.820]  then my car blows up on the way home. You'd be crazy not to say it's a car bomb. We'll
[28:57.820 --> 29:00.340]  break it down.
[29:00.340 --> 29:05.060]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[29:05.060 --> 29:10.060]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[29:10.060 --> 29:16.500]  autism, and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we
[29:16.500 --> 29:22.560]  eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is a
[29:22.560 --> 29:27.980]  virus filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by

[31:04.860 --> 31:09.900]  history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of

[31:17.220 --> 31:22.900]  compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[31:22.900 --> 31:28.220]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback
[31:28.220 --> 31:32.220]  loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total
[31:32.220 --> 31:36.060]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of

[33:01.540 --> 33:08.340]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:08.340 --> 33:23.060]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.060 --> 33:32.140]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live and I'm going to get into this top story
[33:32.140 --> 33:40.420]  now in detail. The clear assassination of the Rolling Stones associate editor, Michael
[33:40.420 --> 33:49.140]  Hastings in Los Angeles Tuesday. And I want to be clear, one of the most common questions
[33:49.140 --> 33:51.500]  or the most common question I get on the street.
[33:51.500 --> 33:57.060]  I got asked by BBC, by Russian TV when I was over in England a few weeks ago, I get asked
[33:57.060 --> 34:02.500]  this stuff constantly. If it's true the government's so corrupt or there's criminal elements in
[34:02.500 --> 34:09.060]  it, that's what's really happening, and they're such gangsters, why are you still alive? And
[34:09.060 --> 34:13.100]  it's because God is in control, number one.
[34:13.100 --> 34:18.340]  Number two, a lot of people are praying for me. But number three, if they kill me, everything
[34:18.340 --> 34:22.620]  I've done is then highlighted, it's a big exclamation point behind it, it underlines
[34:22.620 --> 34:33.740]  it. But also importantly, is that I have a media operation and a program and a plan if
[34:33.740 --> 34:40.940]  I'm killed to continue forward and to investigate my assassination.
[34:40.940 --> 34:46.380]  And I've had that plan in place for five years, and money and lawyers and everything set up
[34:46.380 --> 34:55.220]  and ready, multiple plans. I've got recordings made, some recordings, I need to make more.
[34:55.220 --> 35:01.180]  Because they're getting to the point where if it is all out in the open and it's at crossroads,
[35:01.180 --> 35:05.300]  and they don't go to jail and nobody gets in trouble, and we don't rein these guys in,
[35:05.300 --> 35:06.300]  there's always gonna be corruption.
[35:06.300 --> 35:14.800]  But if we let it run rampant, like a red tide at the seashore, or people paying in the city
[35:14.800 --> 35:19.140]  pools where it's so bad nobody can swim in it. If we let the corruption build up and
[35:19.140 --> 35:25.220]  build up, and then we don't do anything about it, it will then basically redouble itself.
[35:25.220 --> 35:29.620]  And you're gonna see societal collapse, because why should you produce anything? It was just
[35:29.620 --> 35:31.200]  gonna be taken from you.
[35:31.200 --> 35:37.480]  And in fact, they will tax things to the point of collapse, because the mid and low level
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.560]  people don't care and just want theirs. You see, that's the problem with a corrupt society,
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.020]  the will to fight it collapses, and then there's just corruption everywhere.
[35:46.020 --> 35:50.980]  Not just the big centralized corruption, but the low level corruption as well. And Zbigniew
[35:50.980 --> 35:54.820]  Brzezinski writes about this in two of his books, why the globalists control organized
[35:54.820 --> 35:59.420]  crime, why they control the narcotics traffic, why they control all the vices. Their argument
[35:59.420 --> 36:10.060]  is to control it, and to not let it get out of control and have it basically be segregated.
[36:10.060 --> 36:16.660]  But it never goes that way. It always ends up collapsing, like Mexico. Mexico is a failed
[36:16.660 --> 36:23.220]  state with 65,000 dead people. Times passed, I was saying 60 a few months ago, looked it
[36:23.220 --> 36:24.220]  up.
[36:24.220 --> 36:28.340]  65,000 dead people the last six years that they know of, and they're finding mass graves
[36:28.340 --> 36:32.220]  all the time. And even the tourist areas, now they're having kidnappings and bombings
[36:32.220 --> 36:37.340]  and shootings, and the media's paid to not make a big deal out of it. More people have
[36:37.340 --> 36:45.820]  died in Mexico in the last six years than died in the Vietnam War in a decade on the
[36:45.820 --> 36:47.820]  US side.
[36:47.820 --> 36:53.140]  Cuz a million Vietnamese died or more, but 58,000 Americans died and hundreds of thousands
[36:53.140 --> 36:58.800]  wounded. 60 plus thousand dead, and folks, that's what we know about. Some estimates
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.780]  are half the murders aren't known about. There's hundreds of thousands missing, but they think
[37:02.780 --> 37:09.860]  some of them may have fled to other countries. That's where we're going. Why should tax money
[37:09.860 --> 37:13.700]  be allowed to go to fix the sewage when it could just go to El Jefe?
[37:13.700 --> 37:17.340]  And then he lives with his own private sewage system up on a mountain, and he likes the
[37:17.340 --> 37:21.660]  fact you're living down there in sewage cuz you're too poor to do anything to him. That's
[37:21.660 --> 37:27.080]  feudalism, folks. Mexico didn't invent it. Every culture with corrupt oligarchs from
[37:27.080 --> 37:32.580]  ancient Japan to ancient China to ancient Africa to ancient Mesoamerica to ancient Europe
[37:32.580 --> 37:39.300]  to ancient Babylon to ancient Egypt to ancient Greece and Rome was feudalist, except in a
[37:39.300 --> 37:41.540]  few periods in Greece.
[37:41.540 --> 37:48.820]  They were in a few city states. This is a cancer. Why would I risk my life, ladies and
[37:48.820 --> 37:55.780]  gentlemen? Because I am an honorable man. And because I am incensed at a genetic level,
[37:55.780 --> 38:01.580]  at a cellular level by groups of thugs taking over a bunch of brutes. I mean, I look at
[38:01.580 --> 38:08.280]  video of Russian mafia, Italian mafia, Irish mafia, there's all these mafias, but the real
[38:08.280 --> 38:10.560]  mafia is the banking mafia.
[38:10.560 --> 38:15.660]  And it's all like sticking their chest out, acting tough, strutting around, bugging their
[38:15.660 --> 38:21.940]  eyes out at people. That's how they dominate is intimidation instead of beauty and creativity
[38:21.940 --> 38:26.380]  and what they make and what they do. Where they're honored because they can write a beautiful
[38:26.380 --> 38:32.660]  play or invent a new technology or contribute something.
[38:32.660 --> 38:38.380]  And I see men in America now that more and more like men I've seen in third world countries,
[38:38.380 --> 38:43.700]  where men that think they're successful strut around bugging their eyes out at people. Strut
[38:43.700 --> 38:49.440]  around acting dominant and scary. And really, it's because they're scared deep down. We're
[38:49.440 --> 38:51.900]  being reduced back to savages.
[38:51.900 --> 38:57.900]  We're being reduced back to animals. And that really gets to me. And then I start thinking
[38:57.900 --> 39:01.860]  about Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winner, had a new book coming out that totally vindicated
[39:01.860 --> 39:05.980]  his findings of government drug dealing. And he told me, he said, people are breaking into
[39:05.980 --> 39:08.340]  my house, I'm getting death threats.
[39:08.340 --> 39:13.620]  I'm gonna come on my book in a few months, are you ready? And I didn't know Gary Webb
[39:13.620 --> 39:16.540]  that well, interviewed him a few times. I had to call him up to get him on and say no,
[39:16.540 --> 39:21.180]  my book comes out. Then I talked to Celica Steele, the DEA agent. I talked to Freeway
[39:21.180 --> 39:27.580]  Ricky Ross, who knew him well. And they all confirmed on this show, he had special forces
[39:27.580 --> 39:31.380]  who'd wait till he pulled up at home, and then would slide down the two story on the
[39:31.380 --> 39:36.300]  drainage pipe.
[39:36.300 --> 39:39.580]  And then they shot him twice in the head. And I think about all the people I've known
[39:39.580 --> 39:45.260]  that have been killed. And I think about Aaron Schwartz was just fighting for Internet freedom.
[39:45.260 --> 39:50.260]  And so they indicted him on fake charges. And then he said he was gonna beat it and
[39:50.260 --> 39:55.700]  was getting engaged to be married and was laughing at the feds.
[39:55.700 --> 39:59.900]  So they said, you're gonna laugh at us? We'll just drop by your house and hang you. They've
[39:59.900 --> 40:07.060]  killed hundreds of Marine Corps investigators and hundreds of army investigators. A lot
[40:07.060 --> 40:12.580]  of the so-called suicides in the military are really arkansites, suicides. And a lot
[40:12.580 --> 40:23.980]  of them have come out. A lot of times it comes out that they indeed were killed.
[40:23.980 --> 40:30.380]  You're investigating $100 million stolen out of a fund in Iraq? Boom, you're dead. It's
[40:30.380 --> 40:37.380]  gangsterism where now everybody just operates as gangs, but then nothing's getting produced.
[40:37.380 --> 40:43.220]  And the middle class that was producing is so squeezed, because the instinct of the criminal
[40:43.220 --> 40:50.260]  is to make you poor and slap you down and give you nothing.
[40:50.260 --> 40:54.400]  And so that's basically what I'm trying to talk about here today before I get into the
[40:54.400 --> 41:01.000]  evidence of Michael Hastings and the Rolling Stones being killed. Is that we are becoming
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.020]  a total criminal society. And the naivete of the public who deep down know this is true,
[41:07.020 --> 41:11.460]  Congress has a 10% approval rating, mainstream media has the lowest approval rating ever,
[41:11.460 --> 41:13.380]  lowest readership, viewership ever.
[41:13.380 --> 41:19.180]  Obama lost 17% of his youth support in a Gallup poll just last week. People get the systems
[41:19.180 --> 41:25.700]  lying and conning and manipulating, but a lot of people are just giving up. Yeah, I
[41:25.700 --> 41:33.000]  know they're corrupt, but I just give up. And we cannot let a bunch of criminals win.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.860]  We have to stand up for justice. This is our great test. This is our generation's great
[41:36.860 --> 41:42.300]  test. And if we'll just realize that private corporate interests that are anti-free market
[41:42.300 --> 41:46.620]  and pro-monopoly have come in and bought off our government and brag about it, and have
[41:46.620 --> 41:49.640]  taken over Europe and brag about it, they brag.
[41:49.640 --> 41:56.240]  And have shined on the public purse to them to prop up their derivatives that they created
[41:56.240 --> 42:01.700]  to tie to the public as a ball and chain. If we can have an awakening about that and
[42:01.700 --> 42:07.860]  have a real debate about that, we have a chance to turn this around. But we're entering that
[42:07.860 --> 42:12.460]  crossroads, that event horizon right now.
[42:12.460 --> 42:18.220]  And when you look at Agenda 21, that is the official policy of the Pentagon and the CIA
[42:18.220 --> 42:24.060]  and the British Ministry of Defense, it is to break up the family, shut down our industry,
[42:24.060 --> 42:30.480]  and really economically conquer America. Show that we're so dependent, we can basically
[42:30.480 --> 42:38.100]  be forced to assimilate it into a type of communism, like the Cultural Revolution under
[42:38.100 --> 42:44.540]  Mao or the Great Leap Forward, or Stalin's collectivizations in Ukraine and Poland.
[42:44.540 --> 42:50.520]  And again, it's communism for us, which is slavery, and then offshore diplomatic community,
[42:50.520 --> 42:56.300]  mega banks and ultra rich, who are tax exempt, who are running it, and who are exempt from
[42:56.300 --> 43:00.340]  it all. I mean, you understand that, folks?

[45:16.220 --> 45:22.660]  eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled

[47:01.220 --> 47:15.940]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:15.940 --> 47:22.020]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[47:22.020 --> 47:23.700]  to Alex Jones.
[47:23.700 --> 47:31.660]  All right, I'm going to get into some truly epic audio and video clips. If you're a radio
[47:31.660 --> 47:37.540]  listener, you can simply go to infoawards.com forward slash show to find the free video
[47:37.540 --> 47:42.260]  feed of the radio shows so you can actually see these clips. And for other radio listeners,
[47:42.260 --> 47:49.160]  we have them all linked up on infoawards.com and prisonplanet.com.
[47:49.160 --> 47:55.500]  So Michael Hastings of Rolling Stone magazine, Rolling Stone knows what they're doing. They
[47:55.500 --> 48:00.880]  want to sell magazines. They've done big profiles on myself and others. And they did a pretty
[48:00.880 --> 48:06.460]  fair job overall because they understand that they just put out straight propaganda. Nobody's
[48:06.460 --> 48:08.020]  going to read it.
[48:08.020 --> 48:12.760]  They know people want cutting edge stuff. And Michael Hastings brought down General
[48:12.760 --> 48:20.660]  McChrystal and he wrote a best selling book on the subject as well. And he is on record
[48:20.660 --> 48:28.780]  the week before he died saying, I've got info on the NSA, CIA, on General Petraeus' girlfriends.
[48:28.780 --> 48:39.060]  And he went on current TV with the host of the Young Turks, the main host, and said we
[48:39.060 --> 48:44.380]  need to have a war back on the White House who has a war on the free press.
[48:44.380 --> 48:49.020]  And you can say what you want about George W Bush. He didn't go after the press. Obama
[48:49.020 --> 48:53.500]  has arrested a whole bunch of different members of the press, as you know, if they talk to
[48:53.500 --> 49:00.540]  an analyst at the State Department publicly about, do they think North Korea really will
[49:00.540 --> 49:02.500]  start a war?
[49:02.500 --> 49:10.240]  And these are analysts that are allowed to talk to the media. Or if you're a CIA agent
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.900]  and you admit, yes, we're waterboarding, yes, it's torture, and yes, it's wrong, so they
[49:14.900 --> 49:18.900]  go and arrest him. When if something's illegal and you whistle blow, you're supposed to be
[49:18.900 --> 49:19.900]  protected.
[49:19.900 --> 49:24.420]  No one ever had the nerve to do this. But with his fake left cover, he can do it. When
[49:24.420 --> 49:32.940]  Obama drops bombs on Libya and Syria and puts al-Qaeda light in charge of Egypt, it's trendy.
[49:32.940 --> 49:38.120]  When he invades seven different African countries to take over with Afrikan, it's loving and
[49:38.120 --> 49:43.220]  liberal cuz, I mean, he's a black guy. I mean, he can't do anything wrong. They use political
[49:43.220 --> 49:45.180]  correctness against people.
[49:45.180 --> 49:49.020]  Don't want Obamacare, you must be racist. Now, of course, it has to do with it. Shut
[49:49.020 --> 49:56.300]  up racist. They are just using it on the public. And so things are at warp speed. And to get
[49:56.300 --> 50:00.420]  into the technicals, a bunch of engineers are on record talking about it. We have some
[50:00.420 --> 50:06.420]  of the articles on Infowars.com, but you don't tear away the engine from the housing of that
[50:06.420 --> 50:09.600]  model of Mercedes and shoot it down the road.
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.460]  And then have the car burst into flames like that. Witnesses said, as it drove down the
[50:13.460 --> 50:17.580]  road, it burst into flames. And then if you look at the different photos, it came up against
[50:17.580 --> 50:23.980]  a tree. It's not even dented by the tree, it came to rest up against a tree. And the
[50:23.980 --> 50:27.460]  witnesses reported an explosion that shook their houses.
[50:27.460 --> 50:34.500]  But that's not even the big evidence. He said, two hours before it happened, about an hour
[50:34.500 --> 50:39.180]  and a half before it happened, he sent out an emergency email to his military contacts,
[50:39.180 --> 50:44.020]  to WikiLeaks, to family, saying FBI is visiting my friends, my family, my colleagues. They're
[50:44.020 --> 50:47.780]  following me, they're investigating me, you can read his email.
[50:47.780 --> 50:52.380]  And I'm going off the radar, I'm going into hiding. I've got big news about to break.
[50:52.380 --> 50:59.020]  He's going to write a story. And then his car blows up. People say, well, he was seen
[50:59.020 --> 51:06.180]  speeding down the road. That particular model of Mercedes can be 100% remote controlled
[51:06.180 --> 51:08.380]  if someone has access to the car and plugs into it.
[51:08.380 --> 51:15.660]  I have Car and Driver magazine and I have DARPA, DARPA projects leader, breaking down
[51:15.660 --> 51:19.940]  how they can do this. I'm gonna play those clips here. But I don't believe that's what
[51:19.940 --> 51:24.700]  it was, because it looks like a car bomb from past car bombs we've seen. And I've talked
[51:24.700 --> 51:30.700]  to some of my Navy SEAL contacts and my Green Beret contacts, and they say, this is absolute
[51:30.700 --> 51:31.700]  car bomb.
[51:31.700 --> 51:36.620]  It's not a drone, like some are saying. It's not the remote control. Then when you say
[51:36.620 --> 51:40.700]  that, you laughed at someone to cover that. It's a bomb. It's a bomb in the dashboard,
[51:40.700 --> 51:44.620]  ladies and gentlemen, blowing him out the back and blowing the engine out the front.
[51:44.620 --> 51:50.580]  Very well done, probably 10 pounds of C4. They killed him deader than a hammer, and
[51:50.580 --> 51:55.860]  then we're weird. I mean, I probably, without even looking, saw, without trying to find
[51:55.860 --> 52:01.500]  him, saw 10 different articles attacking infowars.com for Wednesday going.
[52:01.500 --> 52:06.100]  He told WikiLeaks he was going into hiding and the FBI was after him and he had a big
[52:06.100 --> 52:11.740]  story breaking. Sure, we don't believe WikiLeaks. Now, the LA TV stations and LA Times have
[52:11.740 --> 52:17.300]  it. Here it is on infowars.com. LA Times reports Hastings was going into hiding before his
[52:17.300 --> 52:18.300]  death.
[52:18.300 --> 52:23.780]  You can go to our article, redlink on infowars.com, and then go read the actual LA Times article
[52:23.780 --> 52:29.820]  about it. And they just have a footnote that he was going into hiding. I mean, imagine
[52:29.820 --> 52:34.340]  if I went on air and said, folks, this could be my last broadcast. I'm going into hiding,
[52:34.340 --> 52:39.020]  they're after me. I'm getting my family out of the country, and on my way home, my car
[52:39.020 --> 52:42.780]  blows up.
[52:42.780 --> 52:47.660]  And the media, day one's like, no foul play, no, no, no, don't look at it, it was no big
[52:47.660 --> 52:52.700]  deal. Why don't they just say Kennedy wasn't shot in Dallas, that a gnat hit him in the
[52:52.700 --> 52:57.140]  head and did that? Cuz they said Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani president, they machine gunned
[52:57.140 --> 52:58.140]  in public.
[52:58.140 --> 53:03.860]  They told American audiences she hit her head in her car. There's video of her being shot
[53:03.860 --> 53:10.180]  by. So Kennedy was hit in the head by a gnat, folks, or Kennedy's car hit a tree. Did you
[53:10.180 --> 53:14.660]  know that's what happened 50 years ago in Dili Plaza? It hit a tree, folks. That's how
[53:14.660 --> 53:19.740]  dumb they think you are, that they run Al-Qaeda publicly in Libya and Syria now and are saying,
[53:19.740 --> 53:21.280]  yeah, Al-Qaeda's our friend.
[53:21.280 --> 53:26.800]  We started a war with them and we're taking over a country that did nothing to us. And
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.420]  then we'll be bombing them, I predict, within a year, just like I said in Libya, which happened,
[53:32.420 --> 53:38.780]  of giving Syria to Al-Qaeda. We'll be bombing them. I mean, it is madness, folks. It is
[53:38.780 --> 53:44.300]  a program of deindustrialization, a program of just trillions being made, no-bid contracts
[53:44.300 --> 53:48.340]  bombing Stone Age countries that can't fight back. It is so criminal.
[53:48.340 --> 53:53.420]  So let's go to this clip, just a few of the local news clips of them talking about what
[53:53.420 --> 53:57.860]  they witnessed with Michael Hastings' car. Here it is.
[53:57.860 --> 54:02.980]  Rolling Stone magazine called Michael Hastings a fearless journalist who refused to cozy up to
[54:02.980 --> 54:07.560]  power. His death at 33 came by way of a fire fueled and explosive crash.
[54:07.560 --> 54:13.140]  It sounded like a bomb went off in the middle of the night. My house shook. The windows
[54:13.140 --> 54:14.140]  were rattling.
[54:14.140 --> 54:18.300]  I couldn't have written a scene like this for a movie where the engine flies from the
[54:18.300 --> 54:23.860]  car, which was about, I don't know, 50, 60 yards up, right down here to this telephone
[54:23.860 --> 54:24.860]  pole.
[54:24.860 --> 54:28.380]  You can read our articles on it where they also quote them in the LA Times. A whole bunch
[54:28.380 --> 54:32.620]  of witnesses saying, no, it blew up as it drove down the road, then quote, jackknifed
[54:32.620 --> 54:36.580]  and flew into the tree. Just driving along, boom.
[54:36.580 --> 54:41.540]  Do you know how much power it takes to shoot a large engine like that? They've now said
[54:41.540 --> 54:47.100]  it's over 60 yards. You know how much power that takes, folks? You could put an engine
[54:47.100 --> 54:54.660]  on top of 10 pounds of C4 and detonate it. You'd be lucky to shoot it that far, okay?
[54:54.660 --> 55:02.180]  Now let's go to what he said a week before he died on the Young Turks program. And boy,
[55:02.180 --> 55:05.460]  you can see them scared on the show after they talked about this. Everybody's scared
[55:05.460 --> 55:09.180]  to say what's happening, and being scared, folks, is what's gonna allow this to take
[55:09.180 --> 55:12.180]  over.
[55:12.180 --> 55:15.980]  There were hundreds of journalists killed around the JFK assassination. I mean, are
[55:15.980 --> 55:21.140]  we just gonna give our world over to organized gangs? Are we really gonna live like this?
[55:21.140 --> 55:25.620]  I mean, do people that work for the system wanna live like this? Cuz it's getting worse.
[55:25.620 --> 55:29.500]  I mean, you really want your kids going into a future, and your answer will be, yeah, I'm
[55:29.500 --> 55:34.500]  gonna make sure I'm as rich and powerful and in the maid group as I can so that they're
[55:34.500 --> 55:35.500]  protected.
[55:35.500 --> 55:39.060]  They won't be protected. The only thing that protects your children is being honorable.
[55:39.060 --> 55:43.340]  I mean, it is despicable what our country's turned into. Let's go to one of his final
[55:43.340 --> 55:46.380]  statements before he went into hiding and was killed. Here it is.
[55:46.380 --> 55:52.380]  Obama administration has clearly declared war on the press. It's declared war on investigative
[55:52.380 --> 55:57.580]  journalists, our sources. I think the only recourse to this kind of behavior by the government
[55:57.580 --> 56:02.860]  is to say back to the government, we declare war on you. And from this point forward, we
[56:02.860 --> 56:08.740]  should no longer, as a media, as a whole, cooperate in any manner with the government
[56:08.740 --> 56:10.900]  in terms of when we're doing national security stories.
[56:10.900 --> 56:14.780]  We should withdraw all our cooperation, and we should publish everything we know because
[56:14.780 --> 56:18.140]  it's a free press, and it's not a free except for when the government tells me to do it
[56:18.140 --> 56:22.620]  press. And it will be way too easy going with these guys. We've let them get away with this
[56:22.620 --> 56:26.700]  for years. We've let them tell us what to print, what not to print. And I say be done
[56:26.700 --> 56:29.900]  with it, and everybody should just get together and fire back because no one else is gonna
[56:29.900 --> 56:31.820]  defend the press.
[56:31.820 --> 56:38.220]  Do you know what Michael Hastings just did right there? Signed his death warrant because
[56:38.220 --> 56:46.740]  he's a leader, he's respected, highly respected, won a bunch of awards. And he basically was
[56:46.740 --> 56:53.160]  like Colonel Travis saying, cross this line, join me, it's an info war, fire back, never
[56:53.160 --> 56:58.560]  give up, we're a free press, stop complying with these people, stop doing what they tell
[56:58.560 --> 57:00.940]  you to do, tell the truth.
[57:00.940 --> 57:05.200]  That would bring them down, folks, if the press stopped being lap dogs and in a group
[57:05.200 --> 57:10.100]  stood up together, they couldn't fire everybody. And it would be the beginning of the end.
[57:10.100 --> 57:13.380]  Just like when my reporter went to all three Boston bombings and pointed out the drill
[57:13.380 --> 57:19.860]  they had in the other backpacks, which turned out was true. And they had the Secret Service
[57:19.860 --> 57:23.800]  basically threaten his health, Dan Badandi.
[57:23.800 --> 57:28.160]  If that starts happening with the rest of the press, it's over for Ceausescu in Romania.
[57:28.160 --> 57:31.740]  It's over for Stalin, it's over for Hitler. They've got to intimidate everybody. And he
[57:31.740 --> 57:35.540]  decided to go all the way, I was going to bring down the NSA and the CIA, and they blew
[57:35.540 --> 57:40.260]  him up. And it's a message too. They know the press really knows they killed him. And
[57:40.260 --> 57:45.060]  now the press is so cowardly, they're attacking me for saying this should be investigated.
[57:45.060 --> 57:51.200]  You guys are pathetic. We'll be back in the second hour.
[57:51.200 --> 57:55.980]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[57:55.980 --> 58:01.660]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[58:01.660 --> 58:07.260]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[58:07.260 --> 58:11.580]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[58:11.580 --> 58:16.720]  be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll

[59:51.400 --> 01:00:02.140]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:08.700]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:25.260]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.540]  The total train number to join us for first time callers on this Sunday transmission is
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:41.620]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX. Again, first time callers 877-789-2539. I'd like to hear from
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:50.220]  you on the murder of Michael Hastings. The power structure comes out and says, it's no
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220]  foul play.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:58.100]  He was speeding, he did it, open and shut day one. You're like, wow, that's kind of
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:05.700]  a declaratory. Yeah, just as declaratory as me saying no, they killed him. And 95, 98%
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:13.460]  chance. And then the way they act and the way the media says don't look at it, don't
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.540]  investigate it.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:23.260]  I mean, we really are society totally ruled by fear and ruled by all these disgusting
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:29.220]  gangs. The big gangs are in government, the big gangs are in these corporations, and they
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:35.180]  wanna be able to take and have whatever they want. You wanna know what kind of world we're
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:40.940]  gonna live in, the 1970s film with James Caan, Rollerball?
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.740]  That is exactly what they wanna build, where everybody's distracted by sports. They only
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.300]  let certain countries have certain types of industry, so none of them can stand up on
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.220]  their own. There's a global corporate government, this is Club of Rome stuff, and he's the
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.100]  top quarterback in the world.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:02.180]  And they tell him, you've been too big, too long, and lose. And they say, by the way,
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:08.860]  I want your wife. It's prima nocta, royalty in France and England, that's on record would
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:22.340]  demand anybody's wife they wanted. Rollerball, and they just throw it all in our face, what
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.060]  they're building, what they're doing, where they're above the law, they're the new royalty,
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.260]  they're the global corporates.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:33.260]  And they learned it from the royalty, diplomatic immunity. When the Queen of England shows
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.700]  up in America, folks, she doesn't show her passport. And now hundreds of thousands of
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:43.860]  bureaucrats worldwide and corporate groups have been given diplomatic immunity. I say
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.860]  hundreds of thousands, there's gonna be millions of diplomatic immunity.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:52.380]  And I've talked to the kids of even low-level diplomats, how they get the, is it the brown
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:57.140]  passport? They can just do whatever they want with it. They could have drugs in their backpack,
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:02.500]  they could have a dead baby in there. It's just they're above the law. You're the UN,
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.020]  you're above the law.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:10.980]  And then Brad Pitt, I went and saw World War Z, I'd read the book, seen some of the earlier
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:20.300]  scripts but hadn't seen them. I did that review, Man of Steel versus World War Z. And it was
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.980]  not one-tenth as bad as the book. I mean, the book is like communism's good, we kill
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.780]  the militia, we take all their guns.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:29.520]  But they're clearly set up for a part two of World War Z, where I guess all that happens.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.660]  It's really kind of like the first chapter of the book. And it wasn't as bad as I thought
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:39.740]  it would be. I'm not a big zombie movie fan, and I'm not an enemy of Brad Pitt. Other than
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:45.660]  the fact his wife promotes all these warmongering globalist operations and demonizes people
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.380]  that are against all these wars.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:52.340]  And it was a UN world government advertisement. And the fact that America couldn't do anything,
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:58.740]  UN saves the world, and an inoculation advertisement. So it was pure UN propaganda placement. It
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:04.620]  was a UN film. And I guess Brad Pitt pretty much admits that. So here's my little two
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:13.500]  cents on that. But I gave Superman, the Man of Steel, nine out of ten Paul Revere horses.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:22.740]  Just because it's pro-man, pro-father, anti-eugenics, pro-individual. I mean, it's very positive.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:31.500]  Just like the new Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, I'd give it nine horses. I'm not just being
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:36.420]  generous there. And I said zero horses for it, but I said I hadn't seen it yet. So it's
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:42.140]  like the book, zero horses. I'd give it three horses. And it wasn't as bad as I thought
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:47.580]  it would be. So there you go. Not really a mea copa. When we come back, I'll get back
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:54.300]  into Hastings. And then take your phone calls, then I'm gonna get into Snowden. I'm gonna
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:57.780]  get to a bunch of police state news. You know the police are gonna bust your house down
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.380]  over your grass? Yeah, any excuse.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:03.420]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.540]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.940]  of information.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:16.140]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.140]  psyche.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:22.440]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.040]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.260]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.780]  verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.140]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:41.140]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.860]  but demand a war.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.940]  Oh, there's another one. Another plane just hit.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:51.260]  State of Mind. Because there's a war on for your mind. Get your copy of State of Mind
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:57.780]  the movie at Infowars.com. And remember, every order at Infowarsstore.com receives a free
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:08.860]  citizen rule book.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:16.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:22.180]  radio network.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:36.780]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539. Specifically, do you like the mafia government we live under?
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:41.480]  That's getting worse every day? And the fact that it's openly trying to convert America
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:47.340]  over to classical authoritarianism and the rest of the world to secure the ill-gotten
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:53.060]  gains of the criminal ruling class that are anti-free market, anti-family, anti-individual?
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:57.060]  Or are we going to stand up against it? Or are we just going to give up? Because if the
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:03.300]  individual starts speaking out and resisting and not complying, and when you see something,
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:04.300]  say something.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:13.220]  So Edward Snowden saw massive illegal NSA wiretapping across the board. And the media
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:21.380]  lying about it, and targeting the Tea Party, and the press, that's now come out. And conservative
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:27.420]  and libertarian company owners, that's in the news today. Using the IRS, the NSA to
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.420]  harass people.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.540]  What, do we all go wear moussey tongue shirts? And then they'll be nice to us? Cuz the average
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:39.300]  American now is so into being cowardly, so into complying. I wanna explain, if you all
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:44.940]  put Mao shirts on, the whole country will collapse and they killed 60 to 80 million
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.940]  people.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:50.060]  No one knows the exact number. The Chinese say 80 plus million Mao killed, cuz everybody
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:57.180]  did what he said. They submitted and they killed them. I mean, I saw people holding
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:03.040]  their hat in their hand and bowing to the Nazis on those old films when they would run
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.820]  into the sand pitch to be shot.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:09.620]  With other dead bodies in there, they would be very politely go in there. And I guess
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:15.020]  I'm an extremist because I'm not planning to do that. I'm planning to peacefully try
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:19.500]  to change this as much as I can. And if anybody tries to take me somewhere, and we learn they're
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.140]  taking dissidents to places and killing them, then you have to defend yourself and that
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.100]  means offense.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:32.300]  And I guess in Nazi Germany, they would call somebody who didn't sit there, women stripped
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.940]  down naked in pits holding their babies. I guess if the woman would have fought back,
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:41.860]  they would have called her a terrorist. And I'm not being sarcastic here, that really
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:47.460]  went on, ladies and gentlemen. Saying yes, yes, yes to everything is gonna destroy our
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.340]  future.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:55.660]  Rolling over, submitting, being passive has gotten us to this point. And where is the
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:01.940]  self-preservation of the media? I know most of you are just kind of establishment fellow
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.900]  travelers. You've already got a cynical worldview, you just go along to get along. You don't
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:10.940]  research geopolitics, you don't research black ops, you don't research the private Federal
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:11.940]  Reserve.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:16.940]  You don't research eugenics, the Club of Rome, you don't research Rand Corporation plans.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:21.260]  I wish you would, I mean, they lay out. I remember reading 15 years ago the plan to
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:26.460]  federalize all police, set up checkpoints, get rid of the family, break down society,
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.900]  convert to basically permanent martial law.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:35.540]  It's the domestic military stability force. And then now they've got it in place under
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:42.060]  NORTHCOM and they're openly rolling it out. And people go, yeah, the army, Alex, sure,
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.260]  martial law. They're not gonna call it martial law. And then all these cowards think they're
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.740]  just gonna go along with it and you're gonna be okay.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.460]  They're setting that up. You've already put up with all this and done nothing. They know
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:58.860]  that. They're setting this up because they're gonna do things so horrible, they know you're
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:05.020]  going to physically resist. You understand that? They want a war with us, but on their
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.020]  terms.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:10.420]  And I'm sorry, it's not gonna happen on your terms. Because many of us reverse engineered
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.500]  what you were doing, and we're aware of it decades before I even came on the scenes,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.020]  mainly former military officers and people that blew the whistle. And a lot of them got
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:24.780]  killed. People in the 50s, 60s, and 70s who were in the NSA, CIA, Army Intelligence, I
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.020]  can name them here on air, who went public and warned people.
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:34.520]  Most of them were murdered. That's why everything the old timers in the John Birch Society told
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.740]  people in the 60s noticed it all came true, just what they said was gonna happen. You
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:42.980]  know why? Because there were good people in the government and in Congress and in the
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:48.700]  Ford Foundation who blew the whistle.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.220]  So the fact that the Army admits they built civilian inmate labor camps for political
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:59.140]  dissidents and quote, reeducation. We just showed the Army manual FM 3-39.40. That's
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:04.460]  declassified. We first got it and put it out so the Army strangely then released it themselves
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.940]  and said, it's no big deal.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:10.180]  See, they're smart. That took some of the power from it. When people were like, is this
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:14.060]  real? Is it real? And two weeks later, it shows up on the Army site. They go, yeah,
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:22.180]  it's ours. Big deal, reeducation camps could be reeducated. The government is rogue. The
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.260]  government's been hijacked.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:29.420]  We're all in danger. The danger is going along with these loons because they wanna extinct
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:33.880]  freedom. They wanna hunt it down and reeducate us so that we never get out from under them.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.700]  They know evil almost always ends up losing. They know their own nature. They know we're
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:43.260]  gonna push back. And so for decades, they've made fun of anybody. He says they want our
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.500]  guns.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.660]  Nobody wants your guns when they're on record wanting our guns. He says they want open borders.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:54.500]  Nobody wants open borders. Really, here's the bill about to pass. He says fluoride gives
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.620]  you cancer and brain damages you. Here's a bunch of Harvard studies saying he's right.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:04.260]  He's still a kook. Shut him up.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:09.660]  And then they say arrest Snowden. He broke the law when they're breaking the law. Their
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:15.380]  new theme song. We should get rid of the Constitution and just have the words of breaking the law
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:19.820]  from Judas Priest. Crank it up. This should be the new Constitution.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:27.300]  Breaking the law. Breaking the law. Breaking the law. Breaking the law. Breaking the law.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:34.380]  Breaking the law. Breaking the law. Breaking the law. And then as our whole future is destroyed,
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:42.780]  we can chant USA, USA, USA as they have checkpoints all over Boston and come in houses and point
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:47.860]  guns at women and drag them out by their hair and shoot up cars of women looking for Dorner,
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:48.860]  a black guy.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.620]  Shoot up white ladies in California and burn his cabin down and say they're gonna burn
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:58.740]  it down and then lie to us and say they didn't burn it down. USA, USA, when you get cancer.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:04.900]  USA, when the troops get nerve gas in Iraq, they don't give them treatment. USA, USA.
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:15.020]  They would never let our troops use DU up until 2000, 1990, 1991 and then 2003. Because
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.900]  they knew it was a death sentence in all the Pentagon military medical reports. And they
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:24.220]  said, you know what, use it, we don't care. A death sentence, one with 20 something years
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.220]  off your life.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:29.300]  Came out in the New York Times. Guess what, 20 something years later, the Gulf War syndrome
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:34.920]  is real. It's nerve gas, their brains are damaged. Guess what, new Harvard study of
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:40.580]  all things, Harvard School of Public Health. It is mercury causing autism to go up. Gee,
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:49.100]  we don't know where it's coming from. It's only on the vaccine vial, says the Marisol.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:54.820]  That was in the New York Times last week. Mercury's causing the autism to go up. Really,
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:59.680]  really? I thought it was a conspiracy there. But it's not the vaccines they say. No, no,
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.380]  they don't know what's doing it.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:09.500]  I wanna go out to break with the man that I'm calling, get the Hastings clip ready again.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:17.420]  The man I'm calling Colonel William Barrett Travis part two. Because when he said we've
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.980]  all gotta stand up and stop complying and stop going along with the lies, cuz they know
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.860]  journalists all know about all this info.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:29.020]  We all need to start firing. When they said that, they said kill him, because he's a leader.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:34.620]  And you know what, his idea will go on. Remember the Alamo, remember Hastings, here it is.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:40.620]  Alamo administration has clearly declared war on the press. It's declared war on investigative
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:45.820]  journalists, our sources. I think the only recourse to this kind of behavior by the government
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:51.100]  is to say back to the government, we declare war on you. And from this point forward, we
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:57.300]  should no longer as a media, as a whole cooperate in any manner with the government in terms
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.140]  of when we're doing national security stories.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.020]  We should withdraw all our cooperation and we should publish everything we know, because
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.380]  it's a free press. It's not a free except for when the government tells me to do it
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.860]  press and we've been way too easy going with these guys. We've let them get away with this
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.940]  for years. We've let them tell us what to print, what not to print. And I say be done
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:18.140]  with it and everybody should just get together and fire back because no one else is gonna
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.940]  defend the press.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:27.100]  And they said, really? The FBI started harassing him, following him, visiting. He said, I got
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:33.180]  a big story. I'm going off the radar, going into hiding. Go read it, it's in the LA Times.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:38.060]  Days after we told you, that couldn't be a real email. Boom, there goes this car. And
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:42.580]  you see, that's the human spirit right there. Hastings is on the right side of history.
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:47.540]  Hastings is a man his wife and child can be proud of. Hastings is what I admire. Hastings
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:52.860]  is who I wanna be. We're all Michael Hastings now. And I stand with Michael Hastings. And
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:59.860]  I may end up having his fate. I say, so be it. I'm committed and will never back down.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:29.860]  Thank you.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:59.860]  Thank you.

[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:11.500]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:17.060]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:21.380]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:26.340]  be a problem? E Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:08.740]  Atlantic Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:21.740]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:39.740]  I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime. Reflecting on my past life
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:52.740]  and it doesn't have much time. Cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:21:03.740]  The sands of time for our constitutional republic. The sands of time for me are running low.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:07.740]  Alright, now we're going to go over some of the specs in the next segment and then go
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:13.740]  to your phone calls. But the model of car of the brand new Mercedes that Michael Hastings
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:19.740]  was driving has the special cruise control system where if it sees a car about to come
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:25.740]  into you, it will take control. And if it says you're speeding, it will take control.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:31.740]  And these are the type of cars that are very easy to remote control. The Germans, the Japanese
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.740]  and others have been putting these out the last few years. I think it's super creepy.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:41.740]  I have driven one of my friends Mercedes that does this. And if you start going over into
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:47.740]  another lane and there's a car anywhere near it will pull you back over. Automatic control
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:55.740]  and see they're coming out with Google cars. They're coming out with all of these systems.
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.740]  And they're going to argue and are already arguing that the cars are safer. So the computer
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.740]  needs to drive you. You can feel like you're driving, but really the autopilot is going
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:10.740]  to be driving. And again, this is the control it gives the system. Just like a Xbox connect
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:16.740]  in your house uses wireless Internet that can actually see through walls to scan your
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.740]  body, your face, everything.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:27.740]  So he was driving a Mercedes C250. Now here is car and driver. Here's an article out of
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.740]  car and driver. And I'm not saying this is how he was killed, okay? But people said,
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:36.740]  yes, he was speeding at high rate of speed and then his vehicle just blew up in the street.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:41.740]  That's what multiple witnesses have said. Looks like a car bomb to me. But regardless
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.740]  since this theory came out that maybe they remote controlled it.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:48.740]  They had drone aircraft in World War II, the Germans and the US did. People still think
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.740]  you don't have drone aircraft nowadays. What do you think the drones are? I said on 9-11
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.740]  we had evidence they were drone operating the aircraft and gas was released on board
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:57.740]  the aircraft.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:01.740]  Because the only real phone calls that got out from air phones were stewardesses coughing
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:06.740]  saying, there's gas, I can't breathe. You nerve gas everybody, then you remote control
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.740]  it. Turns out those planes had been fitted with that. And people go, you can't remote
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.740]  control planes?
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:17.740]  It's like, excuse me? They talked about putting it on all planes by law so hijackers couldn't
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:24.740]  take over. How do you stop the hacker hijacker? Especially if it's Skynet run by a bunch of
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.740]  globalist. So they're putting in a Skynet system, they're just gonna use it to control
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.740]  us.
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:38.740]  Here's car and driver. Can your car be hacked? This came out in July of 2011. Currently there's
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:44.740]  nothing to stop anyone with malicious intent and some computer programming skills from
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.240]  taking command of your vehicle after gaining access. A hacker could control everything
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:55.240]  from which song plays on the radio, to whether the brakes work, to how fast your vehicle
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.840]  drives, okay?
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.940]  And I'm seeing more and more deaths where they don't shoot you, where ambassadors and
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:05.340]  people they wanna get rid of all over the world, when they're in a new vehicle, it just
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:10.740]  takes off wildly and drives right into a pylon. So be aware that that goes on. Now, maybe
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:18.380]  you don't believe car and driver. Let's, and you can look at that model Mercedes, it has
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:22.100]  the system where the computer is already in control.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.900]  We've got that on screen for folks that wanna look at it. Driver assist to go with the flow.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.420]  How about we say we don't want this? Just like I told you, OnStar is used to listen
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:34.300]  to you and kill your car if they're coming after you and then years later they admitted
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.980]  it. Yeah, I was told by an engineer folks, I was shown the documents before OnStar even
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.660]  came out.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:49.340]  Just like I told you all of this. I had dinner last night with two senior engineers and they
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:54.340]  were just laughing about how the public doesn't believe the NSA is listening to everything.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.960]  One was with AT&T and the other with another company I won't name and they didn't tell
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]  me anything secret.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.860]  They were just agreeing with me and saying it's unbelievable. And agreed, yes, we are
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:11.020]  the NSA. Everybody's like Google and Facebook and Amazon are all moving NSA and CIA computers
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:17.900]  into their buildings. They are the CIA. They are the NSA. The NSA and CIA are the lower
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:22.660]  level and then they rotate and revolving doors into the companies where they make millions
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.740]  and billions.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:28.780]  Don't you understand? It's a private New World Order that's exempt from the laws and the
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:33.020]  taxes using government to set the rules to transfer all your wealth to them. I know I
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:38.020]  say that almost every segment cuz that's the essence of the New World Order. We get communism
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:42.260]  and police in black uniforms standing around street corners. We get martial law while they
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:47.740]  fly around in luxury jets above us with life extension technologies.
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:52.020]  I told you 15 years ago they were already growing human organs and cows and harvesting
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.860]  them out. Now that's admitted all over the Tokyo news and for years they've been doing
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:02.220]  it and now it's perfect. They grow a new nose, new eyes, new heart, whatever you want.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:05.480]  And the point is I'm not even saying all this stuff is bad. The point is you need to know
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:12.740]  it's there. Let's go to this clip of DARPA. This is up on infoawards.com. This is Dr.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:18.660]  Kathleen Fisher, a DARPA program manager, talks about the ability to hack into cars,
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.660]  computer systems.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:25.740]  Now this is up on infoawards.com right now. This has been going on for 20 years, folks.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.780]  But let's go ahead and go to the clip. The whole clip's up on infoawards.com. I'm gonna
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:31.460]  play just a short clip right now. Here it is.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.180]  It's not just traditional computers that we need to worry about. There are many other
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:40.700]  kinds of systems as well. The slide that's been omitted showed a result of the researchers
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:46.400]  at UCSD and the University of Washington hacking into the dashboard display of a typical American
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:52.140]  sedan making it show that the car was going 140 miles an hour while in park. Drilling
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.500]  down a little bit, modern vehicles consist of between 30 and 100 embedded control units,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.980]  which are essentially small computers connected via a CAN bus. These cars are required by
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:06.000]  law to have a diagnostic port, typically located under the steering wheel, that allows mechanics
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.820]  to download diagnostic information and to perform software updates.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:15.000]  In a first paper, the researchers from UCSD and the University of Washington showed that
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.100]  if they could touch the CAN bus through that diagnostic port, they could take over all
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:23.500]  of the functionality of the car that's controlled by software. And in a modern automobile, that's
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:28.600]  pretty much everything. The brakes are controlled by software because of anti-lock braking.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.500]  The acceleration is controlled by software because of cruise control. And in those fancy
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.980]  new cars that can park themselves, even the steering is under software control.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:41.960]  All right, that's enough. That's one minute of a 10-minute video, infoawards.com, on the
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:49.200]  official DARPA channel. By the way, DARPA runs it all. DARPA is what Eisenhower warned
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:56.180]  about by name in 1961 in his farewell address. He said, the technocratic elite controlling
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.860]  the military industrial complex.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:04.580]  He said, the main threat is that, we've plugged the clip before, is the technocratic elite
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:10.820]  that is in control of the military industrial complex. So that's why we have to beware the
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:15.060]  military industrial complex. Meanwhile, there were news articles all over the place, people
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:24.260]  sent them to me, making fun of us, saying Alex Jones says that Hastings' car was remote
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:31.520]  controlled. When I never said that, callers brought it up, and I said, yes, they can remote
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.500]  control cars.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:38.720]  And yes, they can hack in wirelessly and do it now if your car has Bluetooth. But I believe
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:43.220]  it was a car bomb by the signature. It won't matter. I predict Rachel Maddow tomorrow will
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:47.060]  say that I said they remote controlled it. Just like I didn't say a tornado was sent
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:51.300]  by Obama to Oklahoma. She doesn't care. She just makes it up and says I do. That's how
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:55.100]  they operate. We're going to come back with your phone calls. I've got a bunch of other
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:29:00.600]  news as well I haven't gotten to yet, dealing with Snowden.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.460]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:08.600]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.980]  of information.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:17.180]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.180]  psyche.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:23.500]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:27.100]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:31.300]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:35.180]  verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is happening
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.180]  so fast. You need to be ahead of the game.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:42.180]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.180]  but demand a war.
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:47.020]  Oh, there's another one. Another plane just hit.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:52.300]  State of Mind. Because there's a war on for your mind. Get your copy of State of Mind

[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.760]  5 to 7 Eastern.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.360]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin. Then we have the weeknight Info Wars
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:11.960]  Nightly News that myself and my crew and my reporters host. First-rate news organization
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:16.080]  with a bias towards truth and liberty and freedom and fearlessness and a little bit
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:26.300]  of red-blooded God guts and guns. That's just the way it is. And for that, we do not apologize.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:32.560]  The good news is I don't normally go spend a bunch of time reading the comments on the
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:40.400]  LA Times and the Daily Caller and New York Magazine and all these people that wrote articles
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:48.200]  and pieces attacking anyone that questioned Michael Hastings' car blowing up when he said
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:49.440]  he was on the run from the FBI.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:53.900]  In fact, they made jokes about that and said it wasn't true until his military buddies
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.900]  and everybody that knew him and his wife. No, no, he sent us this email. He said, I'm
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:03.160]  on the run. I've got the big story. They're after me. Boom. I mean, help me. They're after
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:09.140]  me. Boom. Oh, don't look at any foul play. Conspiracy theories. This is what gets me
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:12.240]  so angry and so frustrated.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:17.160]  I'm still trying to get the public to understand that there is an NSA. Back in like 1996, I
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:22.180]  talk about the NSA and get calls going, that's illegal, violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendment.
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:29.360]  There's no such thing. I remember 10 years ago or 13 years ago now, I got the census
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.320]  before last and I got one of the long forms asking stocks, bonds, sexual persuasion, all
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.480]  this stuff. People didn't believe me when I got that because only one in 10 homes got
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]  one.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.680]  Now they're doing a yearly census and business censuses. And in Australia, they ask you your
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.600]  sexual preference and if you don't answer it, they arrest you. That article's on DrudgeReport.com,
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:55.020]  the left hand side. With a local newscast going, you'll be arrested if you don't. You
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:59.460]  have a right to not speak. You have a right to not self-incrimination. You have a right
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.560]  to not fill out government paperwork all day.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:08.880]  It's called no slavery. It's all just so out of control. And all the taser deaths 500 plus
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.480]  and then one of our listeners sent us the police report and all of it, an 11 year old
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:19.040]  girl who's autistic, who became autistic. When the state came and the CPS made them
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:25.040]  when she was like 12 or like they said nine, take a bunch of vaccines and now she doesn't
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.340]  know who she is.
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:31.680]  And we get the guy on the air and then now she's autistic walking down the road. And
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:37.480]  then they taser her in the back. And then the witnesses all say the police lied about
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:43.280]  what happened. It's just scary. I have video of the police coming to a house and forcing
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.280]  their way to the home cussing at people over three inch grass in the yard.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.320]  They now arrest people all over the US for high grass. The government ships in narcotics,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.920]  ends white slavery, puts cancer viruses and vaccines, hydrofluorosolicic water. The water
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:07.020]  has hydrofluorosolicic acid added to it. And they're the good guys. It's all about worshiping
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.160]  government and they wanna intimidate you.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:14.260]  More and more government has that crazy bearing of a thug. And that should make you get aggressive
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:20.880]  and angry and get involved and organized, not just cower in fear. I have a video that's
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:25.800]  made national news now, was first on local news in Tennessee. But since we talked about
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.600]  on Friday, it's now been national news, which is good.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:33.520]  That's Infowars real contribution is that we take stories that are regional or alternative
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.340]  and we make them national. Things that they don't wanna talk about, where people have
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.500]  complained about their water quality. And the state water quality guy goes, don't complain
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:45.240]  or we'll charge you with terrorism.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.600]  And that's what they're now saying. Protesting is terrorism. Having a free speech is terrorism.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.520]  Freedom is terrorism. And it's not Al-Qaeda anymore, all this is for. Remember, I told
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:58.880]  you Homeland Security is for the American people and you're like, yeah, right, no, it's
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.880]  for Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.520]  Our government ran Al-Qaeda, then they run it now publicly and they admit Homeland Security
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:10.800]  is for you and your family. But they can't get away with this if they don't have the
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.760]  support of the people. And a lot of the people in government are waking up as well, they
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:22.000]  need our support. Government's not our enemy. And good people in government are not our
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  enemy.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.840]  But people that declare war on us and attack us, they're enemies of liberty and freedom
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:32.280]  and justice. And we've got to start calling them out and getting aggressive, ladies and
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:39.920]  gentlemen, or there's no future. But as I was saying, I don't usually go read the comments
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:47.100]  on these sites. But I decided to look at them and no exaggeration, go look at stories about
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.100]  Michael Hastings.
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:54.720]  And you have to read three or four pages of comments. We're talking 20, 30, 40 comments
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.520]  before you find one person agreeing that he wasn't blown up. And that's all I can say
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:07.520]  to the establishment is you can't kill us all. I mean, what are you gonna do? And then
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080]  I think maybe they don't care. They know they bloke, car bomb him in front of all these
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.180]  witnesses that people are gonna know it's a car bomb.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:19.240]  And it's a message to journalists. Well, I've gotten your message before that. I'm not stupid.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:25.120]  I know you guys can kill me, but God can bring you to justice as well. But for all these
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.320]  Christians out there that think you're not gonna go through adversity, you're never gonna
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.840]  have to face evil, you're gonna get teleported out of here. I don't think God's gonna know
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:38.780]  you when you get to the Pearly Gates if you didn't stand up and have courage now.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:42.440]  We don't need sunshine patriots, ladies and gentlemen, we need people that are willing
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:49.520]  to tell the truth now. I mean, I think about why I'm so frustrated sometimes on this broadcast
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.460]  and get upset. It's because I've covered two stacks of news and I've got like 10 other
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:59.520]  stacks here and I've got 15 people on hold over here who I wanna talk to, loaded phone
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:08.080]  lines. And what do you do?
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.880]  Tommy in Tennessee, go ahead. You're on the air. I think Michael Hastings is Colonel Travis.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.880]  What do you think?
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:21.600]  Yeah, good possibility of that. But I got another question for you. I don't see how
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:27.920]  you can support this movie of Superman. I've noticed ever since you have that you quit
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:36.960]  talking about the Stalin era and Stalin's name means Man of Steel. And that's what this
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  movie is.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.400]  I mean, it's the same people that brought us The Dark Knight Rises.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:48.260]  Well, I think Superman, the Man of Steel is a anti-collectivist message. Anybody watching
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:56.040]  that could see that. And the reason we do movie reviews is millions of people tune in
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:00.120]  to hear that and millions watch it online. And I can't tell you how many people I've
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.760]  run into that have woken up from our movie reviews, because they're into that.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.800]  So all I'm doing is taking an issue and giving it a positive review, a negative review or
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:14.920]  a mixed review. And all I'm doing is reaching out to people outside of the crowd. I don't
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:21.500]  think Stalin just means steel. And then his nickname was Man of Steel by the 40s, not
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:26.820]  really in 33, when Superman came out. And the Man of Steel, I mean, you've got Iron
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.460]  Man triathlons.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:35.480]  That doesn't mean that there was Stalin or something. And look, I'm not perfect either.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.660]  I went and spoke in England to a crowd of 2,000 people. They turned away over 1,000
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:43.920]  above Bilderberg. And there were people up there on the stage, some of which I didn't
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.360]  agree with, and people made an issue out of that.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.000]  Well, there was a liberal member of parliament spoke and there was this person. I'm not my
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.040]  brother's keeper. I stand for what I stand for. And I was critical of the Dark Knight
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.520]  with its preliminary message, I think a Jacobin French Revolution message. Well, later I read,
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.920]  they actually said that, that he was modeled after the French Revolution. I'd already said
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:06.320]  that on my own, cuz that's what it was.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.320]  Truth is the truth. And it had one writer in it who wasn't involved in the others. And
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:16.920]  it's just a positive message. But what do you think about the death of Hastings? Do
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.640]  you think that should be investigated or it's no big deal?
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:26.840]  It's a big deal, but it won't be investigated. I mean, another thing is here lately, I mean,
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.640]  I'm a prison planning member too, Allison. You've been wanting to buddy up with Beck,
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.760]  but you never say nothing about him having cushions or skull and bones on his couch and
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  stuff.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.600]  Sir, I am not buddying up to Glenn Beck. I've not even talked about Glenn Beck here. People
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.120]  call in about him. We don't screen your phone calls. And Glenn Beck has said whatever he
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.040]  wants about me, I turn the other cheek. I got bigger things to worry about, okay?
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.860]  But thank you for the call, sir. I'm going to come back and try to take some other calls.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.000]  We don't screen your calls, so they're always all over the map, which makes them very interesting.

[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:17.580]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:21.880]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:27.040]  be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll

[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:20.520]  one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons

[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.720]  our media, at least in the past, talked about it and tried to support them. I'm talking
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:42.740]  about Hastings because we are doing something about the IRS persecuting the Tea Party and
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:46.120]  pro-life groups. We are doing something about the NSA spying.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:50.000]  We are doing something about warrantless checkpoints that we've gotten shut down over and over
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.960]  again because they're unconstitutional. It's a constant fight. And I don't like people
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:48:00.760]  that call in and criticize me and then say, there's no hope, nobody cares. We know the
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.920]  truth in the court of public opinion. That's why they're gearing up a police state. We're
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:11.280]  going to win. But we have to have that attitude. Let's go ahead and go to Dean in Costa Rica.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.280]  Dean, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.040]  Hi, Alex. Hey, go ahead.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:23.640]  Yeah, hey. Yeah, I really believe that the Hastings thing was an FBI because it doesn't
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.560]  have the signature of a mafia hit. They don't go around and bang, bang, shoot them up anymore.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.480]  They're more sophisticated. You never hear about these guys going to jail for money laundering
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.000]  or tax evasion or being processed through the court system.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.600]  You never hear these guys about being busted because they wiretap their phones. It's because
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:47.880]  they are our banking institution. They are our telecommunication system. They are our
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:48.880]  justice system.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.600]  Well, look, the FBI took that Czarnev Boston bombing suspect friend who was a witness to
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.800]  it and shot him in the top of the head a bunch. And then they killed two FBI agents that were
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.120]  investigating it. I mean, they're killing people all the time. I'm saying it's massively
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:09.720]  intensifying and Obama signed the NDAA, which is totally illegal, saying he can kill U.S.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.600]  citizens anytime he wants.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.400]  And the word is they're giving the hitmen these national security orders. So, yeah,
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:21.840]  the FBI is now, I agree. I think the FBI probably was involved. Go ahead.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:27.200]  Definitely involved, because back in the 60s, the mafia adopted the policy that pen is mightier
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:32.360]  than a sword. They can do more damage with a stroke of a pen. And I knew the guy that
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.240]  put this policy, his name was Uncle Jeff, because zip, zip, zip with a stroke of a pen,
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:42.920]  he can do more damage than killing somebody in a bang, bang, shoot him up.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:46.860]  Now listen, Obama was trained by the weatherman and they plan to put 50 million Americans
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:53.920]  in reeducation camps that came out in trials. We played the audio here. And I mean, look,
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.360]  they're doing this. They'll kill a whole village to get one guy they wanna kill with drones.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:04.140]  Of course, I mean, they blew Hastings up. And the question is, will the media, Snowden
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.560]  thinks they wanna kill him. Of course they wanna kill him. Thanks for the call. Let's
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.760]  go to Bob in New Jersey. Bob, go ahead.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.720]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:12.720]  Good, brother.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:18.560]  I gotta thank you for waking me up. I got turned on to you about three months ago. And
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:26.480]  I've never been more awake since I wanted to talk to you about the Michael Hastings
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.480]  thing.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.480]  Yes.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:34.400]  Did you happen to, are you familiar with this Loud Labs? Did you see the video? The one
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.240]  who, you know, the guy who did the-
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.240]  Yes, we have the video. We have the people that drive around the police scenes in LA.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.960]  Yeah, well, what do you think about that? I mean, are you familiar with them? Do you
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.960]  have any contact with them?
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.160]  Well, there's a video. No, it's just one of those police video group, people that go out
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.720]  and shoot video in public, a news unit, private news unit. And it shows the car driving, looks
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:57.200]  like about 80 miles an hour by, maybe the same car. And then you see it all burning
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.800]  a few minutes later when he gets there.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.880]  Yeah, did you happen to watch that one?
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:05.720]  Yes, sir. We have the videos. Yes, sir. What's your point on the video?
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.520]  Well, my point on this is, do you remember the Harley guy from 9-11, right?
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:11.520]  Yes.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.040]  Okay, how he set the narrative for the government. You know, I've seen it from start to finish.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:20.280]  Yeah, a lot of times they'll have, exactly, they'll have operatives there putting a script
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.440]  out. And undoubtedly that happened on 9-11.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:26.720]  Well, that's what I feel like this guy was. If you go back and listen to it after I speak
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:31.200]  with you, okay, the things that you notice, like for instance, when he first gets there,
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.600]  you can drive in the car. It sounds like a cop car. It's got a police radio in there
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.160]  and that's neither him nor there.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:39.720]  But when he first gets there, this is supposed to be a citizen, right? The cops move out
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.280]  of his way. Like that's kind of weird.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:47.920]  I hear you. I think that unit may actually go and do four years and get the police video
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:53.400]  as well. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna contact that group. I mean, it's probably
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:57.840]  innocuous. I looked on their site, they got a ton of police stuff on there and accident
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:58.840]  and fires.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.920]  And every city, as people know, has private groups that go out and shoot video and then
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:06.640]  sell it. Let's go to Nick in North Carolina. Good to hear from you, Bob. Nick, you're on
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:07.640]  the air, welcome.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:15.080]  Hi, two quick points. Number one, the NSA prison program is nothing new. What do people
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:19.480]  think the Patriot Act was for, where it granted government position from-
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:23.080]  I know, and the NSA director went before Congress and said, we don't listen to any phones, we
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.320]  don't listen to anybody. It was just total lie.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:32.000]  And then with Operation Ecolan in the 90s, I mean, yeah. And my other point is that I
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.600]  looked up on Wikipedia a list of journalist assassinations. And Breitbart, Jerry Webb,
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:44.240]  and Michael Hastings were not on that list. And I want your take on whether this trend
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.200]  of suiciding journalists is the threat that is holding up the-
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:52.920]  Well, I mean, this is what I have to say to the corporate prostitute sellouts. You're
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:53:02.240]  destroying your own future, your children's own future. And it's on record that the government
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:06.400]  has assassinated a lot of journalists and other people. And to just sit there and be
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:13.200]  in denial about it is extremely dangerous. I appreciate your call. But it's time for
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.680]  the media to just stop being lap dogs.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:23.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to Zachary in Ohio. Zachary?
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:25.280]  How are you?
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:26.280]  Good, go ahead, sir.
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:30.240]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, because I've been a long time listening to this first time I've
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:34.800]  called, but I can hear the frustration in here sometimes. And I'm a licensed mental
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:39.520]  health professional and I know how hard it can be sometimes when you see somebody down
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:44.720]  a certain path and it's like they're just like a zombie walking. But the Quran tells
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:50.640]  Prophet Muhammad that, will you kill yourself with grief if they do not believe? So sometimes
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.200]  remember that you're doing your job by speaking the truth and giving the truth. And whether
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:00.400]  somebody accepts the truth or not is not the issue. It's that you're doing your mission
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:04.540]  and that hopefully, God willing, we can stand in front of our creator and know that we've
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:07.280]  done our job in front of tyranny.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:13.240]  I hear you. It's just it's so ridiculous now. I mean, they taser people for not answering
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:17.520]  questions. That's torture. They call it pain compliance. And now they're gearing up to
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.680]  take our private bank accounts. And we've just allowed the worst people in the world
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:25.840]  to run things. We're in grave danger. And that's why I'm frustrated. God bless you,
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.440]  Zachary. Good to hear from you. James in South Carolina. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:38.060]  Got a couple of things, Alex. One of them is do you remember Don Bowles?
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.060]  It rings a bell.
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:45.120]  OK. He was killed in a car bomb, I believe, in Phoenix, Arizona. Forty newspapers from
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:49.960]  all over the United States sent investigators to investigate the crime because he was a
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:56.840]  journalist. This same thing seems like something that needs to be done that way. I don't have
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:58.880]  a lot of money, but I could send you a little bit.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:04.020]  No, no, no. I mean, we need to put pressure on the media, but it's already happening when
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:08.120]  almost every comment in the story says we know they killed him. And now it's come out
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:12.600]  that he was going into hiding and on the run. I mean, you've got to investigate that. And
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.840]  whether it's Breitbart or Gary Webb or him, remember, they lied about Pat Tillman and
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.040]  said he charged an al Qaeda nest and then was killed.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:25.160]  It turned out they murdered him. So that's my point is that they do lie. And who was
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:30.960]  he investigating? McChrystal, who covered up the Pat Tillman death? McChrystal.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.800]  Are you saying that the Hastings thing is going to be investigated heavily?
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.880]  No, they've tried to not investigate it in the past. They would investigate it. And we're
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:43.440]  going to try to force the corporate horror media to investigate it, or they're going
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:47.880]  to be obsolete. I mean, they already have almost no readers or viewers because they
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  act like this.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:59.640]  When Don Bowles was killed, 40 newspapers sent people to Arizona to investigate. And
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.040]  they did get some action out of this.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:09.640]  Exactly. My question is, where is the instinct of the idiot media to make fun of Infowars
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:14.080]  for saying this is clearly a car bomb and an assassination? And then they sit there
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:19.760]  like cowards thinking they've got a future just laughing at another murder journalist.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:24.240]  They murdered Aaron Schwartz. They're murdering people. And then sitting back going, yeah,
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.760]  when are you going to get murdered?
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.700]  Like it's entertainment or something. They're going to murder our bank accounts. They're
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:34.040]  going to murder our future if we don't stand up. When good people do nothing, evil takes
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:39.680]  over. God bless you, sir. I hear you. I'll look into that case. Let's go to Eric in Alberta,
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.640]  Canada. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:43.640]  Greetings, Alex.
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640]  Hey, buddy.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:52.000]  Just calling from the loyalist red coat constitutional monarchy up here. The Michael Hastings thing,
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.680]  I saw that video the last guy talked about. I'm not 100% there with you yet because he
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.000]  was driving really fast and he made some quick turns that seem like like how could a computer
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.520]  make that quick of a turn?
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:12.720]  OK, but computers can make even better turns. But here's the issue. If they. Are saying
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:16.820]  it's stupid to look at foul play. How would you say that when he said he was going into
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:21.720]  hiding that they were after him? I mean, I hope I don't say they're after me. Help me.
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.960]  And then I did. And people like, well, people always say that they're after me. Help me.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:31.640]  Look, I'm out of time. I'm sorry to all the other callers, Damian and John and Adrian
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.880]  and Mr. Lawyer and everybody else. Back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central info wars dot com. Follow
