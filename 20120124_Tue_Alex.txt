[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.280]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.280 --> 00:36.040]  Oh, you're going to want to be tuned in to the entire transmission today. I was just sitting
[00:36.040 --> 00:41.840]  there trying to think of words to describe how hardcore and off the charts all of this news is.
[00:41.840 --> 00:49.800]  But this is going to be a massively important transmission. I want to thank you so much for
[00:49.800 --> 00:59.040]  joining us. It is Tuesday, the 24th day of January 2012. Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris
[00:59.040 --> 01:08.480]  Hedges will be joining us coming up in the second hour today. He is suing the Obama administration,
[01:08.480 --> 01:15.080]  the corporate whore, nobody, teleprompter, reader, latest empty suit.
[01:15.080 --> 01:24.200]  Because the NDAA affects journalists. Because it basically states in the subsections, and we'll go
[01:24.200 --> 01:31.360]  over these on air with him, that if you're aiding in any way, whoever they say are terrorists,
[01:31.360 --> 01:36.440]  you can disappear into a black hole forever. And we know that under Obama, it's even worse
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.880]  than Bush, if that's possible. They've been persecuting whistleblowers and journalists
[01:40.880 --> 01:48.000]  and putting them in prison, even if journalists are reporting on criminal actions of government.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.640]  So there's a real attempt at chilling effects going on here. And Chris Hedges,
[01:54.640 --> 02:01.520]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who's suing the government over this, will be joining us.
[02:01.520 --> 02:12.720]  Great job with the crew getting that guest set up today. Now, continuing here with the news,
[02:12.720 --> 02:20.240]  this is the type of stuff I have in my stack. You can see, if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv,
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.200]  let's give folks a wide shot of this if we can. I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[02:26.200 --> 02:32.600]  eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14 stacks here. And I don't even know where to begin. I'm like
[02:32.600 --> 02:39.520]  a dog in a butcher shop. A starving hyena in a butcher shop, no relation to canines,
[02:39.520 --> 02:46.520]  but whatever. The analogy is taken, I'm sure. Because you wanna prove tyranny and the country's
[02:46.520 --> 02:51.640]  plunging into despotism. And they're attacking free speech and habeas corpus and due process
[02:51.640 --> 02:59.000]  and private property and the family and spiking our food and water and medicine with Trojan horse
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.120]  garbage and writing white papers on how they're doing it. And running giant child kidnapping rings
[03:04.120 --> 03:10.600]  and not getting in trouble and openly setting the precedent for it. Look at this, LA military
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.120]  exercise, KFI news radio. And it's like, the military will be practicing taking over the city,
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.720]  it's for your safety. Just more acclimation for martial law.
[03:19.720 --> 03:27.480]  Here's another one out of info wars.com with associated press video. Red spotlights to mark
[03:27.480 --> 03:34.120]  pre-crime suspects. Folks, the AP actually calls it the new pre-crime divisions with federal grants.
[03:37.720 --> 03:42.760]  The behavioral experts or the biometrics say you're acting suspiciously. They say your walk
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.240]  is suspicious and red lights from city blocks away target you. And then telescreens begin saying,
[03:49.240 --> 03:56.120]  we are watching you, we are your government. And it's got the police chief in one New Jersey city,
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.000]  shows all the cops. And I'm not knocking folks that are overweight, but I mean,
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.680]  it's like a joke. They're all weigh about 400 pounds. I mean, obviously,
[04:03.640 --> 04:09.480]  it just shows the decadence. And they're saying, they got talking cameras that shout at you in
[04:09.480 --> 04:18.440]  England. Well, we got red spotlights on top of it. And the AP reporter, if 15 years ago I was
[04:18.440 --> 04:24.600]  making a joke video of a police state future, I would do the voice the way the AP reporter does.
[04:24.600 --> 04:33.400]  It's like, this new pre-crime system is to keep their safe. Everyone loves it. I mean,
[04:33.400 --> 04:39.800]  it's like they're trying to be comically evil. Okay, that's two articles out of about 100.
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.400]  You know I'm gonna do it. On the other side, I'm gonna attempt to read each one of these headlines
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.880]  and then dive into it. Rush Limbaugh has come out and actually said, and we have the article.
[04:49.880 --> 04:53.480]  But by the way, I forgot to tell you that there's an audio link. Get that too off the article for
[04:53.480 --> 04:59.320]  me at infoawards.com. He's eventually calling for Ron Paul and Rand Paul's arrest as terrorist.
[05:01.480 --> 05:06.360]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,

[06:06.600 --> 06:10.280]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.960]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence
[06:15.960 --> 06:21.960]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[06:21.960 --> 06:27.960]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:27.960 --> 06:33.800]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[06:33.800 --> 06:38.120]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking
[06:38.120 --> 06:42.520]  for more matches. And the congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like
[06:42.520 --> 06:48.920]  nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the republic.
[06:48.920 --> 06:55.640]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watching online right now

[08:05.400 --> 08:17.400]  on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:17.400 --> 08:31.560]  It is Tuesday, the 24th day of January, 2012. We have
[08:32.280 --> 08:40.760]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges, who is suing the Obama administration and the
[08:40.760 --> 08:47.720]  federal government over the NDAA. He is going to be joining us in the second hour for the first
[08:47.720 --> 08:57.400]  30 minutes, 35 minutes or so of the first part of the second hour. So he will be joining us
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.920]  in the first half of the second hour today. Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges.
[09:02.920 --> 09:10.040]  SOPA and PIPA are still fully alive as I predicted they would do last week.
[09:10.840 --> 09:14.280]  I pointed out it was a victory that they had to pull the fast one and claim that they were
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.000]  pulling the bills. But I predicted that they would go ahead and turbo launch them this week.
[09:19.720 --> 09:23.000]  We have that confirmed. We're gonna be breaking that down.
[09:26.520 --> 09:32.360]  Also, the federal government is announcing that all testing and public brainwashing
[09:32.360 --> 09:39.720]  centers, indoctrination, FEMA camp, induction training centers, anti-family, forced inoculations,
[09:42.120 --> 09:46.840]  sex brainwashing, new world order, destruction camps, also known as public schools.
[09:47.960 --> 09:54.680]  Your digital DNA, digital photo, digital thumbprint will now be accessed to take tests.
[09:55.240 --> 09:57.880]  It's already been like that for a long time, they're just now announcing it.
[09:57.880 --> 10:03.080]  All the federal computers, all the federal licensure, all the essays you write,
[10:04.360 --> 10:08.920]  the computer systems that quote, check for plagiarism for more than a decade.
[10:08.920 --> 10:13.320]  That's just the cover story. All of your writing is held in federal databases.
[10:14.120 --> 10:20.040]  Just as all of your DNA, if born in the last 40 years, it's 40 years this year.
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.960]  40 years ago, worldwide in a global government program. See, we've been under global government
[10:25.960 --> 10:32.280]  for a long time, a corporate global government, where countries don't get IMF World Bank loans.
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.160]  Countries don't get global corporations to even come and agree to build a dam,
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.880]  or agree to even allow them to be operating. I mean, if you don't want the globalist in,
[10:41.880 --> 10:44.920]  they finance rebels, they finance your neighbor to attack you.
[10:45.480 --> 10:49.960]  They inject your population with HIV, half your women then get it.
[10:50.920 --> 10:54.040]  They poison your water supplies. I mean, this is all in State Department,
[10:54.040 --> 10:59.400]  Miranda 200. They shut off your food supply. It's in the UN documents,
[10:59.400 --> 11:06.600]  UN biological diversity assessments. So we've been under global government for a long, long time.
[11:07.720 --> 11:12.120]  Evidence of that, of course, is they celebrated 50 years, the European Union in 2007.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.240]  And even people in Europe said, I thought it started in 2000. How is it a 50-year anniversary?
[11:17.880 --> 11:23.080]  Because the Treaty of Rome established the corporate governance of Europe as a receivership
[11:23.080 --> 11:31.480]  to N.M. Rothschild and Her Majesty Saxe-Coburg-Gotha of the UK and Allied crime syndicate
[11:31.480 --> 11:39.320]  holdings of the Commonwealth, as well as the Dutch holdings. And then Allied with the United States
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.320]  and Rockefeller holdings. I mean, it's all on record. And they're eugenicist?
[11:44.360 --> 11:47.960]  And you got fluoride in your water to give you bone cancer and lower your IQ?
[11:47.960 --> 11:56.120]  Cuz they said so. And that's the way it is. And narcotics are shipped into your country?
[11:56.120 --> 12:00.680]  Because that's the way it is. Cuz they said so. You're gonna be in their little private prison
[12:00.680 --> 12:07.480]  working for 25 cents an hour. Because they said so. And you're gonna displace everybody's jobs
[12:07.480 --> 12:15.560]  and the traitor government is going to pay to have your factory shipped to China and Brazil
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.440]  and Eastern Europe. And the federal government's gonna pay to have taxes raised on companies that
[12:20.440 --> 12:26.680]  stay in the US to incentivize them leaving the United States. And all the billionaires on record
[12:26.680 --> 12:33.080]  will pay only a few percentage points in taxes. They will pay almost no taxes. But you,
[12:33.080 --> 12:38.440]  a blue collar worker, are gonna have the book thrown at you because the name of the game,
[12:38.440 --> 12:48.600]  the goal is to destroy you and your family. And they control both political parties.
[12:48.600 --> 12:53.560]  They control the leadership of both traitorous groups. And it's the same thing with the
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.800]  parliamentary system where you've got three or four major parties in Europe. This is what
[12:57.800 --> 13:07.480]  they're doing. Now I'm gonna stop right there. And I am gonna attempt to just read you each
[13:07.480 --> 13:10.920]  of the headlines and then go back into it. You know I always fail. I always go two or
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.360]  three articles in and stop and just bore into that article.
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.240]  But things are getting wilder and crazier by the minute. Things are getting very, very clear.
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.080]  Things are getting to the point where the globalists don't even hide what they're doing
[13:27.080 --> 13:38.840]  anymore. Here is the article at infowars.com with the audio and the video.
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.800]  Limbaugh, Ron Paul sounds like an Islamic terrorist,
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.760]  says he would have no problem with TSA detaining US Congressmen. Now you notice all the new TSA
[13:50.760 --> 13:53.720]  ads for a year, and we told you this was coming because we got internal documents from
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.160]  good people inside the federal government. That they sold the tyranny in the name of
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.840]  fighting quote Muslim extremists, which they knew was popular in their focus group test.
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.440]  But behind the scenes, none of it was to do with Islamic terrorists.
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.160]  All of it was about gun owners, libertarians, conservatives. Now you see the rollout of the
[14:15.160 --> 14:25.080]  white Al Qaeda. You see the TV ads, the PSAs, the video PSAs, where everyone in these ads on TV
[14:25.080 --> 14:33.640]  is a white collar executive type, male, female, and everyone reporting them as a quote minority.
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.680]  So now they're going to sell the quote minorities, who are really the majority in most areas of the
[14:38.680 --> 14:43.480]  United States, that no, no, no, no, no. You're tired of being pointed out as the terrorist
[14:43.480 --> 14:50.120]  cuz you got brown skin. Now it's the white person, they're the terrorist. So they're selling it in a
[14:50.120 --> 14:57.320]  balkanized way and rolling out and saying on the news, the militias work with Al Qaeda and are
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.120]  getting ready for new Oklahoma City. Now does anybody believe that the militia type?
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.680]  I mean, when 9-11 happened, most of the militias stopped being afraid of the federal government,
[15:06.680 --> 15:16.360]  embraced the police state, and basically stuck Al Qaeda hunting licenses. Al Qaeda seasons open
[15:16.360 --> 15:19.960]  hunting licenses on the back of their cars. I mean, I'm sure you all saw those
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.480]  American flags everywhere. These are good patriotic people who bought into the propaganda.
[15:25.480 --> 15:33.720]  The idea that good old boys in Michigan or Texas or Indiana or Florida or Tennessee
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.880]  or California would get anywhere near Al Qaeda, which itself is a manufactured front group on
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.440]  record by the big global banks, as a way to menace us into taking away our liberties.
[15:45.560 --> 15:50.200]  Anyone who believes that is certifiably stupid, but the system doesn't care.
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.280]  And so now here's the rollout. So you've got congressmen, you've got senators,
[15:56.280 --> 16:03.000]  and Limbaugh is saying, I side with the TSA. Now, of course, he sided with them right at
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.720]  the same time the White House was siding with them. Now here's the Hill newspaper, White House
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.960]  sides with TSA in Rand Paul's standoff, says they don't know anything about a police state
[16:11.960 --> 16:17.880]  in America, that's a quote. Now that's the White House spokesman, Carney, Jay Carney.
[16:17.880 --> 16:22.360]  He knows nothing about a police state. Now just major universities list us now as number six
[16:22.360 --> 16:32.520]  globally, and goes on to say they're keeping us safe. And that Rand Paul is wrong, but Limbaugh
[16:33.800 --> 16:42.600]  goes even further. And he says to everyone involved, we've got the clip here, we're gonna
[16:42.600 --> 16:48.600]  play in a moment, that this is basically what they deserve. Not only is it good to wanna grow
[16:48.600 --> 16:57.560]  up people's genitals, not only are microwave oven scanners good, but he goes one further that these
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.760]  people are like terrorists. And that's how it works. See, you wanna know if Rand Paul's for
[17:02.760 --> 17:07.880]  real or Ron Paul's for real, look at their voting records. And look at how the left and the right
[17:07.880 --> 17:15.960]  establishment acts like they are devils. And they do this because the establishment is scared
[17:15.960 --> 17:24.920]  to death. Now I have flown just five or six times on expensive private jets, because over the years
[17:24.920 --> 17:29.880]  I've had people say I'm sitting in a jet to pick you up, I wanna talk to you. Famous Hollywood
[17:29.880 --> 17:35.080]  folks, people like that, they don't fly commercially. People that are making 20 million,
[17:35.080 --> 17:41.320]  30 million, $50 million a year, they don't. And so it's like sending a car for you.
[17:41.320 --> 17:45.320]  When I'm on national TV or something, sometimes they send a car, it's like a black team,
[17:45.320 --> 17:48.760]  it's like a black taxi to pick me up. Well, for rich people, truly rich people,
[17:48.760 --> 17:56.360]  it's like sending a car. And so a Gulfstream jet, not even Gulfstream, even bigger than that,
[17:56.360 --> 18:02.840]  just giant wide body jet lands and picks you up. And one time I was being flown by guys that
[18:02.840 --> 18:07.800]  fly Rush Limbaugh. And they're like, your talk show host, yeah, we fly Limbaugh sometimes,
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.920]  he's got this type of jet, it's really nice. It's about a $40 million, it's about as nice
[18:12.920 --> 18:19.880]  as these type of jets get. It's the same type as this one that I was flying on.
[18:19.880 --> 18:26.040]  They were flying me out to California. And I'm the only guy on a jet with just for like
[18:26.040 --> 18:32.120]  30 people could be on, it's ridiculous. And so when I got home four or five days later,
[18:32.120 --> 18:37.960]  I typed into the search engine about his jet and surely enough, there were a couple jets he owns.
[18:37.960 --> 18:42.680]  Cuz he makes hundreds of millions of dollars every four or five years. And so I understand
[18:42.680 --> 18:49.960]  for him, see, I'm scum. Obama sees us as scum, Limbaugh, all these elitists see us as scum.
[18:49.960 --> 18:56.520]  And they just go to a private airport, don't get checked in, I just walk right on the tarmac.
[18:57.160 --> 19:04.200]  And there's pilots and a person serving me caviar, whatever I want, and the jet takes off. But see,
[19:04.200 --> 19:07.160]  I don't live like that, I don't have the money for that. If I had the money for that,
[19:07.160 --> 19:12.760]  I wouldn't live like that. But these elitist, most of them living off banker bailout money and stuff,
[19:13.480 --> 19:20.280]  they're all flying around like Bain Capital that owns what Rush Limbaugh's on that's been
[19:20.280 --> 19:22.920]  connected to Goldman Sachs and others that have gotten taxpayer money.
[19:22.920 --> 19:27.720]  They're all flying around in their big taxpayer funded jets up there in the sky.
[19:28.280 --> 19:35.000]  And then little old Alex Jones, I can't fly now, I can't go anywhere cuz I won't let a pot-bellied
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.280]  person molest my children and my wife. And see, little old Rand Paul, he's flying commercial,
[19:42.280 --> 19:48.280]  he's a low level scum, US Senator according to Limbaugh. And so he's Al Qaeda, he deserves to
[19:48.280 --> 19:52.440]  have himself groped. I'm gonna play you this clip when we get back and get into all the other news.
[19:52.440 --> 20:05.160]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[20:22.440 --> 20:41.160]  We'll be right back.
[20:52.600 --> 20:57.400]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[20:57.400 --> 21:23.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[21:27.400 --> 21:31.480]  We'll be right back.
[21:57.400 --> 22:01.480]  We'll be right back.
[22:27.400 --> 22:33.560]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to
[22:33.560 --> 22:37.480]  protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest,
[22:37.480 --> 22:42.120]  forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank
[22:42.120 --> 22:46.040]  issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[22:46.040 --> 22:50.760]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system. Call for your
[22:50.760 --> 22:59.720]  copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[23:03.160 --> 23:07.320]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no
[23:07.320 --> 23:11.880]  one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone is home watching
[23:11.880 --> 23:17.080]  television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light
[23:17.080 --> 23:22.200]  as a real television. So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV. Fake TV plugs
[23:22.200 --> 23:27.400]  in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars
[23:27.400 --> 23:31.720]  cost far less than an alarm and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[23:31.720 --> 23:38.280]  Use it anytime you're away from home to order your fake TV for only $34.95. Go to faketv.com
[23:38.280 --> 23:45.400]  or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake TV is only $29.95. So get one for you and one
[23:45.400 --> 23:53.480]  for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to
[23:53.480 --> 24:11.400]  faketv.com. Faketv.com. The burglar deterrent. Okay, I'm going to plunge into the off the charts
[24:11.400 --> 24:17.720]  news coming up. George Soros warns of violent riots in America, financial collapse, government
[24:17.720 --> 24:25.320]  clamp down. Martial law. That's what's going on at Davos right now. That's what they're discussing
[24:25.320 --> 24:29.960]  and acting like they never saw it coming, even though they've had the military and police
[24:29.960 --> 24:35.400]  worldwide joint training and gearing up for it for at least two decades.
[24:35.400 --> 24:40.600]  But the minute they got rid of Glass-Steagall where they could create unlimited Ponzi fraud
[24:40.600 --> 24:46.520]  paper in the late 90s, they began in earnest getting ready for the designed implosion.
[24:46.520 --> 24:54.200]  On the way up, the bankster, fraudster, anti-free market, trillion controller class.
[24:55.240 --> 24:59.080]  They're more than billionaires. They're trillionaire controllers. They control trillions.
[25:00.360 --> 25:06.840]  Began the preparation for total implosion of the economy.
[25:06.840 --> 25:12.600]  Now I get so mad when I hear a audio clip like this because it just shows the
[25:12.600 --> 25:20.280]  tyranny manifesting that I have trouble speaking. I got so angry when the New York Times within
[25:20.280 --> 25:29.560]  30 minutes of Rand Paul not being detained, coming out and saying he was never detained.
[25:29.560 --> 25:36.520]  Senator Rand Paul there in Tennessee at the airport, that I called some folks I know that
[25:36.520 --> 25:41.000]  are high up in his office, I'll just leave it at that. And got an off the record that no,
[25:41.800 --> 25:50.040]  he's just been released. He was there about two hours. He's getting on a plane to DC.
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.280]  I knew this before his wife did. Because then I called the individual back and said, yeah,
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.760]  I just talked to his wife. Everything's, now she knows what I'm talking about.
[25:58.760 --> 26:03.320]  And now she knows what's going on. The point is, is that I knew what was going on from inside
[26:03.320 --> 26:11.400]  while it was happening. And then separately, here's the New York Times, within 30 minutes
[26:11.400 --> 26:19.080]  of Kurt Nemo writing his article yesterday. Kurt Nemo just happened to be looking at
[26:20.360 --> 26:24.360]  emails he was getting and somebody said, hey, Kurt, look at this new Twitter that was just put
[26:24.360 --> 26:30.040]  out by Ron Paul. Within minutes, Kurt was writing a blurb. And within 15 minutes of Kurt Nemo
[26:30.040 --> 26:36.440]  writing on Infowars.com article, then it was CBS, New York Times, and all the rest of them.
[26:36.440 --> 26:37.240]  But the point is,
[26:41.160 --> 26:45.880]  New York Times, when no one knew what had happened to Rand Paul, nothing had been
[26:46.680 --> 26:52.760]  confirmed yet except for his phone call to his dad, Ron Paul, who then put the Twitter
[26:52.760 --> 26:59.320]  out that he'd been detained. No one else had talked to Rand Paul, not his wife, no one.
[26:59.320 --> 27:03.800]  As soon as he talked to his office, I called my source and they said, here's the deal,
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.680]  they're letting him get on another plane. He just got on and he's going to DC.
[27:08.680 --> 27:15.320]  It had just come out. And the New York Times came out with a lie and said he was not detained,
[27:15.880 --> 27:16.760]  and others did.
[27:16.760 --> 27:26.040]  Now, it turns out for two hours they held him and would scream at him and tell him,
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.200]  he ended up, he'd been there about 30 minutes when he called Ron Paul.
[27:30.920 --> 27:33.800]  They came into the cubicle, and I've got his quotes here in The Daily Caller,
[27:35.400 --> 27:41.240]  and screamed at him and said, now you're gonna be held longer. You're not supposed to make a
[27:41.240 --> 27:46.760]  cell phone call. How do you have that cell phone? Or we wouldn't even have known that.
[27:46.760 --> 27:53.640]  So my point is, this is the level of deception that we deal with as a society is, he wasn't
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.120]  detained. We're not groping your children. We're not going in their pants. There's no radiation.
[27:58.120 --> 28:01.960]  We're not strip searching old ladies. And it always comes out that they're lying.
[28:02.600 --> 28:08.920]  It's a policy of lying to us. And now the media is calling Rand Paul a liar
[28:08.920 --> 28:13.720]  when everybody knows they detain people. And by the way, you're under arrest when the police car
[28:13.720 --> 28:19.800]  lights go on, when they tell you go over here, when they're putting their hands on you,
[28:19.800 --> 28:25.800]  that's a custodial arrest under common law. So he wasn't just detained, he was under arrest.
[28:25.800 --> 28:33.000]  It's worse than the word he even used. And in America, Ron Paul has been on this show
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.840]  and talks about him groping his genitals and going in people's pants.
[28:40.840 --> 28:44.360]  And what did the media at that time do? They came out and said, Ron Paul's lying,
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.360]  they don't go in the pants until all these videos came out showing it happening. And they said,
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.760]  well, we don't call that going in the pants even though we do go in your pants.
[28:54.040 --> 28:58.520]  Remember a few months ago, they said these old ladies, 90 years old, 85 in one case,
[28:58.520 --> 29:01.320]  they're lying. We don't take them in a back room and strip search them.
[29:01.320 --> 29:04.520]  And then it came out that indeed they were and they apologized last week.
[29:05.480 --> 29:08.760]  But they're still doing it. They always say we're gonna stop and they don't stop.
[29:09.480 --> 29:12.120]  It's just a psychological warfare program.
[29:14.840 --> 29:17.560]  We're gonna go to break and come back with a limb ball clip, but imagine,
[29:18.440 --> 29:25.320]  I wanna fly. I wanna go places, but I cannot have hot belly pedophile stick their hands
[29:25.320 --> 29:30.680]  down my daughter's pants. I mean, they take baby's diapers off. They beat people up,
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.640]  people died in their custody. I can't be part of it. And then limb ball just says,
[29:35.640 --> 29:40.280]  you know what? We're all Al-Qaeda. He comes out and says, we're gonna play the clip here
[29:41.800 --> 29:49.640]  that he's an Islamist terrorist. It's not a joke. They're gonna start arresting people like us.
[29:49.640 --> 30:01.640]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[31:00.280 --> 31:04.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[31:04.920 --> 31:09.000]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.560]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[31:13.560 --> 31:17.720]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again.
[31:17.720 --> 31:23.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[31:23.000 --> 31:28.520]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[31:28.520 --> 31:32.680]  food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[31:32.680 --> 31:38.440]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit
[31:38.440 --> 31:44.280]  them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at
[31:44.280 --> 31:56.040]  877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[31:56.040 --> 32:02.440]  barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. You've heard Alex explain how the
[32:02.440 --> 32:06.920]  silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver
[32:06.920 --> 32:11.640]  solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[32:11.640 --> 32:17.160]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario
[32:17.160 --> 32:22.520]  Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator. Not only does the silver lung system
[32:22.520 --> 32:27.400]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper
[32:27.400 --> 32:33.160]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[32:33.160 --> 32:39.640]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[32:39.640 --> 32:44.760]  digestive system. Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver lung system
[32:44.760 --> 32:52.360]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works. As well,
[32:52.360 --> 33:03.880]  we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:03.880 --> 33:11.000]  No, I won't back down in the face of tyranny. I'll stand my ground. Well, I won't back
[33:11.000 --> 33:21.560]  down. No, I won't. You can't back down. I mean, if you back down to a tiger in the Indian jungle
[33:21.560 --> 33:26.440]  or a lion on an African savanna, it's going to think you're a prey and it's going to definitely
[33:26.440 --> 33:34.120]  eat you. And so I've got to stand my ground. It's not courage, but just getting back to this.
[33:35.480 --> 33:39.800]  I went and looked up the planes because I was forgetting them. I've flown on G4s, G5s,
[33:40.360 --> 33:46.840]  wide body aircraft that people in Hollywood, and again, I've never really sought out Hollywood,
[33:46.840 --> 33:50.840]  but over the years, famous folks have invited me out there, flown me out there,
[33:50.840 --> 33:56.040]  come and pick me up before. And I've seen how these people live.
[33:57.080 --> 34:03.640]  And somebody comes and picks you up in a 20 million, 30 million, 40 million dollar aircraft,
[34:03.640 --> 34:08.280]  G4s, G5s, wide body. I mean, you could put 40 passengers on them.
[34:10.360 --> 34:13.080]  And it's all the finest of everything.
[34:13.080 --> 34:24.040]  And that's how Rush Limbaugh lives. I flew with some guys like, yeah, you're a talk show host.
[34:24.040 --> 34:27.640]  One of the pilots had heard the show a few times. Yeah, I've seen you on YouTube. Yeah,
[34:27.640 --> 34:31.960]  yeah, a few years ago, we've flown Limbaugh before. He's a nice guy, blah, blah, blah.
[34:31.960 --> 34:36.120]  Yeah, we fly him down to the Caribbean. Oh yeah, Limbaugh's famous for his trips to the Caribbean
[34:36.120 --> 34:42.040]  by himself. But they didn't get into any of that. And it just made me think about it later.
[34:42.040 --> 34:46.520]  So I went and searched it and found out about the aircraft he owned, 20 million dollar,
[34:46.520 --> 34:52.760]  40 million dollar aircraft. And just keeping pilots on standby to fly the aircraft.
[34:52.760 --> 34:57.560]  So I understand why Limbaugh thinks it's all funny, just like Obama does.
[34:57.560 --> 35:02.520]  And just like Nancy Pelosi does, and just like the former head of Bain Capital,
[35:02.520 --> 35:11.480]  Limbaugh's former boss, and owner, Mitt Romney, Mr. Abortion, Mr. Open Borders, Mr. Obamacare,
[35:11.480 --> 35:18.840]  that we're told is so great to vote for. I understand cuz they're all flying around above us.
[35:19.400 --> 35:23.560]  You know how you fly? You go over here to Austin-Bergstrom Airport where I live,
[35:23.560 --> 35:28.840]  you pull up, you walk in, there's no security. Somebody walks over and asks if you wanna drink
[35:28.840 --> 35:35.640]  or coffee. And when you get on board, you sign your name with the pilots on a register.
[35:35.640 --> 35:40.280]  Sometimes I haven't even done that. And then you just take off into the wild blue yonder.
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.320]  And by the way, when you pull up at these private aviation facilities,
[35:45.320 --> 35:47.080]  there's people in them all over the place.
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.760]  I've been in some of these places before where there's 20 or 30 people in there getting ready
[35:52.760 --> 35:59.400]  to get on aircraft. And that's how they all fly. The people that run America, the people that have
[35:59.400 --> 36:03.720]  made the decision, you wonder why Congress does this? Most of these Congress people have stolen
[36:03.720 --> 36:07.960]  so much money. You'll see the statistics where they go to Congress worth a million dollars,
[36:07.960 --> 36:10.760]  and six years later are worth 400, 500 million.
[36:14.360 --> 36:17.800]  Why would you spend millions and millions to get elected to a position where you get paid
[36:17.800 --> 36:21.240]  a couple hundred thousand a year? Because they're in their insider trading,
[36:21.240 --> 36:26.120]  they're in their buying and selling this country, getting payoffs, you name it.
[36:27.960 --> 36:31.320]  And then if you criticize that, they're like, you're anti-free market. No,
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.080]  it's not free market to have trillions of dollars, 27 trillion last time we counted,
[36:37.080 --> 36:42.600]  16 trillion that was secret to the Federal Reserve, and counting. Given to mega banks,
[36:42.600 --> 36:52.120]  given to MSNBC, given to media divisions, and given to subdivisions of Goldman Sachs and others
[36:52.680 --> 36:57.160]  that are connected to them like Bain Capital and others, that then goes to talk show host.
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.800]  People always wondered, how can Rush Limbaugh get paid more money a year than his show makes?
[37:04.200 --> 37:09.400]  Because it's the weapons division of the New World Order to keep conservatives in line while
[37:09.400 --> 37:17.400]  he's hanging out partying with Elton John, which I'm not there judging Elton John.
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.560]  But people are like, well, he's a conservative leader. What's he
[37:19.560 --> 37:22.680]  doing spending millions of dollars on a party and hanging out? Well,
[37:22.680 --> 37:29.480]  that's what Rush Limbaugh does, that's who he is. These are a bunch of grandiose
[37:30.280 --> 37:35.720]  people who are empty. I mean, if I was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, I'll assure you,
[37:35.720 --> 37:42.040]  I wouldn't be spending $2 million on a party. You better believe it'd be going to charities
[37:42.040 --> 37:44.760]  for children in the third world. By the way, it's where some of my money does go.
[37:45.800 --> 37:49.000]  But I'm not judging them, they can do what they want with their money.
[37:49.560 --> 37:54.840]  But don't sit there and create a two class system where I get my genitals grabbed,
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.320]  and I get body scanned, and my wife gets her breast grabbed. And then they literally grab them,
[37:59.320 --> 38:05.560]  and my children get trained for sexual assault by a bunch of out of control goons
[38:05.560 --> 38:11.000]  that violates my Fourth Amendment, my Bill of Rights, my Constitution, my Republic.
[38:12.920 --> 38:17.080]  And you sit around laughing about us, how we're unwashed masses, and how funny it is
[38:17.080 --> 38:24.760]  that the TSA is doing this. By the way, senators can get a card and go around TSA. Of course,
[38:24.760 --> 38:29.720]  Rand Paul doesn't even know that, because he's not into elitist perks, he's a regular guy.
[38:29.720 --> 38:35.800]  Ron Paul can go around the screening, since other Congress people complain, he doesn't do it,
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.840]  he goes through it. The media then lied and said he uses taxpayer money to fly first class. Turned
[38:40.840 --> 38:47.240]  out MSNBC and AP had to retract, that wasn't even true. He flies so frequently, sometimes he gets
[38:47.240 --> 38:54.200]  upgraded, they upgrade him. That's the crimes of Ron Paul, when flying to and from the district,
[38:54.200 --> 38:57.640]  it's paid for by taxpayers, and they spin it and say yes first class.
[38:57.640 --> 39:02.520]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul's being harassed and groped and grabbed on as he said here on this show.
[39:03.240 --> 39:07.320]  And Limbaugh talks about the Paul family and says they're basically Islamic terrorists,
[39:07.320 --> 39:14.680]  they deserve it. And my daughters are terrorists, or old ladies that are made to walk when they
[39:14.680 --> 39:20.200]  can't. And they make passengers help them get up out of their chair and then rip colostomy bags off
[39:20.200 --> 39:24.120]  of them. And take them behind closed doors and scream at them, and make the old women
[39:24.120 --> 39:30.200]  strip down 90 year old women going home to die of cancer in one of the cases.
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.080]  Yeah, one of them I saw last year is dead now. She was going home to Michigan to die,
[39:35.880 --> 39:42.760]  was it 91 years old, stage four cancer, going home to see the family, going home to die.
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.600]  And they screamed at her, she couldn't get out of the wheelchair. She had one family member with her,
[39:48.600 --> 39:53.480]  a woman couldn't get her out of the chair, they screamed and made passengers come over and help.
[39:53.640 --> 40:00.440]  That's America, and then you get this pill popping synthetic heroin head who takes synthetic heroin,
[40:00.440 --> 40:04.280]  takes so much of it, he's got to be put in a coma to go off of it.
[40:06.440 --> 40:15.480]  Being caught flying in from third world sex tourism destinations with bottles of Viagra
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.400]  he doesn't have prescriptions for. I guess that's why a few times he didn't fly on his
[40:21.400 --> 40:27.800]  private jet for whatever reason. Sitting there lecturing us, and look, I don't get nasty about
[40:27.800 --> 40:31.400]  these other talk show hosts, you know that. I don't spend my time attacking other talk shows,
[40:31.400 --> 40:34.440]  even though they attack me sometimes, but I'm sick of it, man.
[40:35.160 --> 40:39.080]  I'm tired of this fascism. They're now setting up highway checkpoints
[40:40.120 --> 40:42.840]  where they're gonna try to grope my family, and enough's enough.
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.920]  I would love nothing more than to be able to get up here and commend Rush Limbaugh,
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.000]  and commend Glenn Beck. You notice I haven't been attacking Glenn Beck as much lately,
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.040]  because he's now endorsing Ron Paul. He's now, when I do spot checking,
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.320]  admitting the stuff's going on. And I guess that's why I got thrown out of Fox,
[40:59.320 --> 41:02.040]  because he was getting too hardcore, and he's going in the right direction.
[41:02.040 --> 41:06.280]  So you don't hear me talking about Glenn Beck. Even though they imitate everything we do,
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.200]  I'm glad, imitate it, just don't twist it, good. And Limbaugh, I'm glad, I'm glad,
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.600]  Limbaugh. I grew up in high school listening to him, and he was a different person,
[41:16.600 --> 41:21.320]  and he helped wake me up. I don't hate Rush Limbaugh. He's a sad person.
[41:21.320 --> 41:27.480]  And Rush, it's time for you to turn back, man, and not be such a disgusting New World Order servant.
[41:28.280 --> 41:34.200]  I mean, you don't have to enthusiastically bash Rand Paul. I understand you're a sellout.
[41:34.200 --> 41:37.880]  You gotta have your hundreds of millions in your trophy wives, and you're in a prison.
[41:37.880 --> 41:43.400]  And when I look at you on TV, you look like you're in hell. I mean, we all punish ourselves
[41:43.400 --> 41:49.320]  for what we are. But you'd be a lot happier if you, and I'm sure you're blackmailed. I mean,
[41:49.320 --> 41:58.680]  who knows? The point is, is that it is time for you guys to stop being so happy about stabbing
[41:58.680 --> 42:03.800]  America in the back. I mean, I know you're mercenaries, I got all that. But I mean,
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.680]  just don't have so much fun slitting America's throat while you dance around posing as
[42:08.680 --> 42:13.960]  conservatives. By the way, we are number one in Orlando and other cities against Limbaugh.
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.840]  Anywhere they put me on, even a moderate station, I will destroy all these people.
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.640]  You talk about free market, you have to have a monopoly cartel to be number one in this country.
[42:24.200 --> 42:32.600]  I'm down here with a plastic baseball bat knocking home runs when you've got a big Louisville
[42:32.600 --> 42:37.080]  slugger. I've got a baseball bat, you shouldn't be able to hit a ball five feet. And I'm knocking it
[42:37.080 --> 42:41.080]  out of the park, pal, and you know it. So don't get me all this free market stuff and
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.880]  survival of the fittest. Everybody knows this shows a trillion times more hardcore.
[42:47.240 --> 42:52.040]  And I don't even want to dominate all these people. But it's pathetic to see these propped
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.880]  up facades by the New World Order, they're the co-op conservatives. There's articles out today
[42:57.880 --> 43:03.160]  about Mitt Romney has to have paid crowds of people with signs, of course he does.
[43:03.160 --> 43:06.760]  Newt Gingrich can't even get a crowd. It's being reported because it's all
[43:06.760 --> 43:10.440]  fake. You really think he won by those percentage points in South Carolina?
[43:10.440 --> 43:12.760]  We told you that's where you see the fraud a month ago.
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.320]  Confirmed fraud in Iowa. Florida is gonna be confirmed fraud.
[43:20.520 --> 43:25.560]  And again, I've spent 43 minutes ranting about just this issue, because here's Rush Limbaugh
[43:25.560 --> 43:29.080]  agreeing with the White House. White House says Rand Paul's bad.
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.760]  The media runs a hoax saying he wasn't detained.
[43:34.520 --> 43:40.920]  He was arrested, folks. That's what it is. It's arrest when you're told you can't leave this area.
[43:40.920 --> 43:47.000]  That's a custodial arrest. That's the law. And when they start groping your children,
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.840]  it's sexual assault. And here's Rand Paul.
[43:50.840 --> 44:01.640]  It's against federal law to detain him except for murder or treason. Read Article 1,
[44:01.640 --> 44:08.440]  Section 6 of the law, the big law. He's there two hours, misses votes in the Senate.
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.040]  It's on record. And what does the New York Times do? They take the word of confirmed
[44:14.040 --> 44:20.760]  liars. The TSA, while he hasn't even gotten on his airplane yet, after two hours of being held up,
[44:20.760 --> 44:25.320]  and say it isn't true. From a group that lies about everything under the sun.
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.080]  And what does Limbaugh do? Article at infoawards.com. Limbaugh,
[44:33.080 --> 44:37.080]  Rand Paul sounds like an Islamic terrorist, says he would have no problem with TSA
[44:37.080 --> 44:44.760]  detaining US Congressman. And this is from a guy who's got 20 and $40 million aircraft
[44:44.760 --> 44:51.080]  and flies around eating caviar above all of us. Financed by Mitt Romney's company,
[44:51.080 --> 44:56.280]  who the other head of it just went to work to replace mobster daily in the Obama administration.
[44:56.280 --> 44:59.800]  One big, nasty, disgusting family.
[45:03.640 --> 45:09.560]  Fat on our banker bailout money on your taxes. And all the incentives to deindustrialize this
[45:09.560 --> 45:17.080]  country, lecturing us about free market all day. And now implying that Rand Paul is a terrorist.
[45:17.080 --> 45:22.840]  Let's go ahead and play the clip, here it is. The video clip and audio clip, here it is, folks.
[45:22.840 --> 45:49.880]  Now, if this had been Ron Paul, you couldn't really blame the TSA. You have to admit Ron
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.480]  Paul almost sounds like an Islamic terrorist sometimes, but this wasn't.
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.920]  This was Rand Paul. Anyway, folks, the Republican establishment is in a full-blown panic.
[46:02.920 --> 46:10.360]  All right, that's enough. And again, I don't even like attacking Limbaugh. It's just so
[46:10.360 --> 46:15.880]  pathetic. Yeah, to be clear from the clip, he's saying Ron Paul's the terrorist. The point is,
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.320]  they're implying that people are terrorists. Let's have the NDAA. Let's secret arrest people.
[46:21.320 --> 46:26.440]  Let's do all of this. And then if you go to the urban warfare drills or you get press passes,
[46:27.000 --> 46:33.960]  like I did last year, sent Rob Dood to Illinois. It was US troops training to put American dissenters
[46:33.960 --> 46:40.840]  in camps on video. And I've been to so many of these myself. Here it is out of KFI radio,
[46:40.840 --> 46:53.320]  AM 640. And it says LA military exercises, and it says the LAPD with the military
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.840]  will be running drills in different parts of the cities that will involve helicopters.
[47:00.760 --> 47:06.520]  And it goes on from there. And it's all the condition of military and the public for domestic
[47:06.520 --> 47:11.640]  operations. I told you this 14, 15 years ago. Now they admit that's what it's for.
[47:15.480 --> 47:19.160]  That's the type of news reports I have. All over the country, they're putting in
[47:19.160 --> 47:21.160]  cameras that yell orders at you now.
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.640]  And that spotlight you from hundreds of yards away with powerful
[47:27.640 --> 47:31.880]  spotlights and begin barking orders at you with bullhorns.
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.040]  I've got that coming up after a Pulitzer Prize winning author that's suing the federal government
[47:36.680 --> 47:48.040]  over the NDAA joins us. But there's Limbaugh. And you read Rand Paul's statement.
[47:50.920 --> 47:53.880]  He was held for two hours and told he couldn't leave.
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.040]  And just like when there's thousands of videos of him groping women, children, hands down pants,
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.560]  what does TSA always do when they're confronted on TV? They go, we don't do that. They put out
[48:03.560 --> 48:09.160]  statements, we don't do that. And they say, well, in the pants, we don't call that in the pants.
[48:09.160 --> 48:13.080]  A strip search, we take your clothes off, but that's not a strip search. Well, there's
[48:13.080 --> 48:20.040]  radiation, but we say it's not bad for you. Just a pure culture of lying. But so what?
[48:20.040 --> 48:26.520]  It's us, the unwashed masses. What did one of the Rockefellers tell Aaron Rushto in an interview
[48:26.520 --> 48:32.360]  I did with him? Aaron knew he was pretty much a dead man gonna die. So he kind of gave that death
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.640]  bed, he died a few months later, talk with us. He couldn't even really walk when I went and met with
[48:37.640 --> 48:41.400]  him in Houston outside the cancer research facility. He was ready to tell the story of
[48:41.400 --> 48:45.400]  Nick Rockefeller. Nick Rockefeller said, yeah, we're all gonna have chips in us.
[48:45.400 --> 48:48.760]  And our chip is gonna tell the police we've got diplomatic immunity,
[48:48.760 --> 48:54.920]  and we can do whatever we want. We're gonna walk to the airports, they're gonna be able to stop
[48:54.920 --> 49:01.640]  us. And I already see that in the news. Or in California and other areas, the license plates
[49:01.640 --> 49:09.000]  of government employees can't even be read. And where they live is secret. And now the military
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.800]  gets to go through their own line. The military can be trusted, but citizens can't cuz they're
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.960]  the enemy. Not only is the military gonna operate domestically, something you never do in a free
[49:17.960 --> 49:22.520]  society cuz the military fights an enemy. And because every third world despotic country has
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.600]  the military domestically. But now they're even separating them more, where the bureaucrats,
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.080]  the pilots said we're not gonna be part of this, so they're left alone.
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.800]  The military goes through their own line and doesn't get searched.
[49:36.920 --> 49:43.160]  They're now putting that in place, but we, the little citizen scumbags, we have absolutely
[49:43.160 --> 49:53.800]  no rights. And that's the elite plan. And Nick Rockefeller was telling him that it was gonna be,
[49:53.800 --> 49:56.600]  and he gave me photos of him with Nick Rockefeller. We looked it up, sure enough,
[49:56.600 --> 49:59.160]  it's Nick Rockefeller, part of the Rockefeller family.
[50:00.200 --> 50:03.240]  Lives in China most of the time, running a big operations firm over there.
[50:06.200 --> 50:09.240]  But now they're just saying they're gonna skip the chip, it's gonna be a face scan.
[50:09.240 --> 50:13.000]  But then you'll have a special RFID on your card. And the cops are gonna be like,
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.920]  the cops are not allowed to stop you. You're like, well, how do they do that? It's already
[50:16.920 --> 50:21.960]  in common law for senators and House members. And it's for the UN, has it?
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.080]  The globalists are gonna have global get out of jail free cards.
[50:26.840 --> 50:30.920]  While the rest of us can just be secretly arrested and disappeared for no reason.
[50:30.920 --> 50:37.480]  They are scientifically codifying total evil. And why? A lot of people send emails and go,
[50:37.480 --> 50:39.640]  well, I'm going along with the system, I don't have anything to worry about.
[50:39.640 --> 50:45.160]  The system is gonna shut off all the resources on purpose to consolidate control.
[50:45.160 --> 50:49.080]  They want you so poor, you can't even think about resisting.
[50:50.040 --> 50:53.000]  The UN says that's why they want people to be poor worldwide.
[50:53.880 --> 50:57.000]  All right, I'm gonna get into the even bigger news with George Soros when we come back,
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.920]  then we got the Pulitzer Prize winner joining us.
[51:00.920 --> 51:05.720]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team
[51:05.720 --> 51:10.840]  want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts
[51:10.840 --> 51:15.960]  against the globalist on every front. Infowars.com is leading the fight
[51:15.960 --> 51:20.200]  against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[51:20.200 --> 51:24.840]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com,
[51:24.840 --> 51:31.560]  you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[51:31.560 --> 51:35.000]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.360]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle
[51:38.360 --> 51:40.680]  between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[51:41.240 --> 51:46.840]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global
[51:46.840 --> 51:51.080]  eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[51:51.080 --> 51:54.440]  The war is here. It's an info war.
[51:54.440 --> 52:00.280]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[52:00.280 --> 52:07.800]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[52:07.800 --> 52:11.160]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear,
[52:11.160 --> 52:15.560]  because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[52:15.560 --> 52:20.600]  Here's why. Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from

[52:27.560 --> 52:30.680]  Unlike gas generators, the solar generator runs quietly,
[52:30.680 --> 52:33.880]  amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun.
[52:33.880 --> 52:37.800]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[52:40.520 --> 52:43.720]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.

[55:25.720 --> 55:33.160]  leaves us at the bottom of the next hour. If you go to infowars.com, you can read the article,
[55:33.160 --> 55:35.960]  but it came out of the Daily Beast, a division of Newsweek.
[55:35.960 --> 55:41.000]  Soros from Davos, it's going on right now, warns of violent riots in America,
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.440]  financial collapse, government clamp down. He says survival is the most important thing.
[55:46.440 --> 55:50.520]  He's gonna sit down and interview with the Daily Beast, and he said he's never seen something
[55:52.120 --> 55:59.240]  this bad. He says from surviving the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War II
[55:59.240 --> 56:03.800]  to single-handedly crushing the currencies of entire nations, the experience he brings
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.440]  to the table should not be ignored. This is a Mark Slavo article at infowars.com.
[56:08.440 --> 56:12.920]  I was trying to look for it during the break, I've seen it many times, they may have pulled it.
[56:12.920 --> 56:18.040]  But he was on 60 Minutes a decade ago and admitted to being a Nazi sympathizer who helped round up
[56:18.040 --> 56:22.200]  fellow Jews in Hungary. And he said, well, if I didn't do it, somebody else would have,
[56:22.200 --> 56:25.960]  so he doesn't feel bad for it. Now, I wanted to play that on the Nightly News tonight,
[56:25.960 --> 56:28.840]  but dues and they're looking for it for like 30 minutes, they can't find it.
[56:28.840 --> 56:33.800]  He even remembered the quotes. Can somebody find that video and email it
[56:33.800 --> 56:39.080]  to showtipsatinfowars.com? I mean, I'm sure we're gonna find it,
[56:39.080 --> 56:43.400]  but I think he needs to be all over YouTube, he must be jerking it down.
[56:43.400 --> 56:49.720]  Cuz I wanna get the truth about Soros out. But the point here, by the way,
[56:49.720 --> 56:53.160]  speaking of Glenn Beck, when Glenn Beck actually had the courage to play clips of this and talk
[56:53.160 --> 57:00.600]  about it, Soros threatened to come after him. And then said, the media implied it was anti-Semitic
[57:00.600 --> 57:07.960]  to talk about how Soros helped track down and find Jews' property and help take it.
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.640]  And so now if you're not for hunting down Jews and taking their property, you're anti-Semitic.
[57:13.640 --> 57:18.360]  I mean, this is the upside down world and the ADL said they were concerned and you don't talk
[57:18.360 --> 57:27.720]  about Soros like that. It's just so sick, it's so sick, it's sick, it's sick, it's sickening.
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.920]  It's sickening to have people making jokes about Ron Paul getting groped and Rand Paul,
[57:34.040 --> 57:37.080]  and people getting detained and saying, they're like Muslim terrorists.
[57:38.920 --> 57:42.920]  It's sick, it's sick to have all these TV shows glorifying torture,
[57:43.560 --> 57:46.920]  including of people's children to get answers. And then in the real world,
[57:46.920 --> 57:50.520]  the military is torturing children, in the army's own report.
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.240]  That's sick, that's dangerous, and it will be used on us.
[57:55.240 --> 57:59.720]  Like Ron Paul has said about the NDAA and some of these debates, he said,
[57:59.720 --> 58:04.520]  hey, it could be you next, media. Why are you going? Don't you get it? It is gonna be for us.
[58:04.520 --> 58:10.600]  The New World Order hates Americans a lot more than they hate Muslims or foreigners.
[58:10.600 --> 58:14.600]  They've always hated us. Why do you think they have incentives to ship our jobs overseas?
[58:15.960 --> 58:19.080]  So Soros, who said he was having a great crisis a few years ago,
[58:19.880 --> 58:23.160]  who says he's pulling all his money out of the markets for total collapse,
[58:23.160 --> 58:27.480]  he's now acting like he's upset when he's one of the main authors of it.
[58:28.040 --> 58:32.360]  And at Davos, they're saying they're gonna help us get rid of capitalism and bring in
[58:32.360 --> 58:35.880]  a new socialism to make it all fair. That means give all the money themselves.
[58:35.880 --> 58:38.200]  And they're debating how to be moral right now.
[58:43.400 --> 58:47.480]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.480 --> 58:53.240]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century? Record foreclosure rates
[58:53.240 --> 58:58.360]  for homes, if not yours, your neighbors. Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid
[58:58.360 --> 59:04.280]  off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with
[59:04.280 --> 59:09.560]  thousands of other Americans. Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[59:09.560 --> 59:14.440]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control,
[59:14.440 --> 59:20.840]  your greatest dependency, your food supply. Make 2012 the year you take control by getting

[59:49.880 --> 01:00:05.480]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:12.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:21.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:33.320]  All right, we are now into the second hour. We're scheduled during the next segment
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.880]  to have Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges on.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.040]  He's suing the Obama administration over the NDAA that could be used against himself and others,
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.120]  that they've been targeting. Not just whistleblowers, but journalists that talk
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.880]  to whistleblowers about corruption, from torture to you name it. In the news system, somebody like
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:58.680]  Cy Hirsch would end up being thrown in prison. So he's doing something that's absolutely needed.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:05.000]  So we're gonna be talking to him about that coming up. Ron Paul has been ignored in the GOP debate
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.440]  once again. Congressman was afforded less time than any other speaker. And his only big question
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.520]  was asked, when are you gonna drop out? To imply like he's not a real candidate
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:21.080]  in number two position in most states. With this rent a candidate Mitt Romney, this corporate
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:29.080]  plastic Republican version of Obama. Cuz they're both slick, they're both handsome men.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.560]  They both can lie well, and they pretty much stand with the very same policies.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:41.080]  I mean, this should, conservatives always talk about not liking rhinos and not liking
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:47.320]  fake conservatives. I mean, it's getting worse, it's not getting better. I don't wanna hear any
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.480]  criticism of liberals that supported Obama, thinking they'd get all these free goodies
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.480]  and the whole world would be great. He's owned by the very same mega banks.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.280]  He just hired the former head of Bain Capital, one of the colleagues of Mitt Romney to head
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:06.920]  up the financial stuff and replace daily. I mean, it's just absolutely the same pedigree,
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.440]  the same crew politically. It's the same political pedigree, the same political funders,
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:18.040]  the same political system. These ruthless mega corporations that are not free market,
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.840]  that are turning our world into a fascist structure.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.040]  I don't just use the word fascist, cuz it's a fun word like Hitler this, Hitler that.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.840]  Fascism is what this is, when government is there to give contracts and to have a controlled
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:39.720]  economy for a select group of free market systems. And the black uniforms and the secret
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:47.640]  police and the war like expansionist tendencies. The cameras, I mean, it's got all the telltale,
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.680]  it's a perfect fascism. And it's here, and it's growing like a cancer.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.960]  And Rush Limbaugh makes jokes and says, so what if Rand Paul is detained for two hours?
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:05.080]  Ron Paul deserves to be because he's like a domestic terrorist, sounds like an Islamic
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:11.320]  terrorist. For just saying, let's not launch new wars, we're going bankrupt.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.640]  See, the big mega corporations that are getting the no bid contracts, the oil, and dominating
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.320]  the globe, they don't care if America goes bankrupt. They want it to because then we're
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.040]  in debt to them. Because they're controlled by the big mega banks, and they don't care
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.120]  the big mega banks that issue with the currency and credit.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.080]  They want to get us into debt because they're getting us into made up debt. They get the
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:37.480]  world for nothing out of a giant militarized Ponzi scheme. See, a smart Ponzi scheme doesn't
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:43.960]  implode like Ponzi or Madoff who are just low level people like Ken Lay. People think
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.640]  of them as high level, but that's about as high level as the system burns, they're mid
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.680]  level. Overall, the scheme low level if you compare it to the real owners of the system.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.560]  But a smart Ponzi scheme has a propaganda system and is backed up by military force
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:02.840]  and threatens the entire system. It's so big that they say if you cut out the cancer,
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.840]  the system bleeds to death. So the answer is the cancer just grows and grows and grows and
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:16.680]  holds everyone hostage, and things get worse by increment. And then now, they are doing
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.960]  military drills for the American people. Those weren't drills for overseas.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:25.560]  They are asking your kids in the public schools and private schools, what do mommy and daddy
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.320]  do politically? They are setting up domestic spy groups, they are hiring the preachers
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.920]  under clergy response teams to spy on their flocks. I mean, every creepy, scary thing
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.960]  we've seen from authoritarian societies, like they've got a list and they're just going
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:48.840]  down it. And this police state is so absurdist. It's like a cartoon version. It's so over
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:54.280]  the top. We'll be right back with our special guest. And then coming up, I'll get into all
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:21.240]  the financial news and more in your phone calls today. Stay with us.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:40.120]  We

[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:10.840]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:16.120]  the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.880]  police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:27.160]  camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.200]  government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state for chronicles the
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:37.240]  sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:43.240]  of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:48.520]  and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:56.200]  The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online

[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:30.600]  deodorants, or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.800]  you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want something
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.400]  better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never

[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:20.360]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:26.920]  Alex Jones. Okay, Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize winning author, got a little bit late. He needs
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.120]  a few minutes. We're going to be calling him back. He and others are suing Obama over indefinite
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.320]  detention law. We're going to be talking to him here in just a few minutes. But just illustrating
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:45.080]  how crazy the police state has gotten, we don't have time to play the whole video here. But if you
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:54.200]  go to infowars.com, you can pull up the entire article and watch the whole thing.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:03.240]  Red spotlights to mark pre-crime suspects. And the whole piece is done like a cartoon.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:13.720]  We do have him now. Okay, the video is ready. It is like a cartoon in that it is so
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:19.560]  incredibly ridiculous. It's like if I was making a video about a joke police state with
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:25.320]  a simpering voice, creamily talking about the security and how much the citizens love
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.360]  the cameras and the license plate readers in the town and the red spotlight that spotlights
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.040]  them from hundreds of yards away, and the police getting off on it.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.960]  But it's not a joke. It's not a 1984 remake. It's New Jersey. Now, let's go ahead and go
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:46.360]  to part of that clip. It almost looks like a scene from the science fiction movie Minority
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:52.200]  Report. A New Jersey city is going to start marking people with a red light before they
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.880]  might commit a crime. The police chief in East Orange, William Robinson, is embracing
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.880]  it as the latest pre-crime law enforcement technique.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.480]  Whereas London have talking cameras, we're about to deploy light projecting cameras,
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:14.040]  better known as light-based intervention systems. The directed red lights will be attached to
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.800]  existing surveillance cameras and can shoot a light beam a full city block away. If a
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.560]  police officer monitoring one of the city's many high-def cameras sees a crime about to
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.080]  occur, like someone about to get mugged, they will remotely bathe the would-be perpetrator
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.000]  in red light. The message to the criminals is the police are observing the cameras and
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.480]  are observing you. The police are recording you and the police are responding.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.440]  A few years ago, East Orange had one of the worst crime rates in the state as rival Crips
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.800]  and Bloods gangs battled and sold drugs. The city used federal grant money to invest in
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:59.320]  lots of new technology, which the chief says has brought crime down to the lowest level
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.880]  since the 1960s. Daily policing here is all high tech. Sensors attached to the top of
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.160]  patrol cars instantly read the license plates of all vehicles the car passes.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.640]  A monitor shows a picture of the car owner.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:20.440]  Okay, so there is the Associated Press. And the whole thing is like something out of Stephen
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:26.600]  King's The Running Man, or a remake of 1984, where how wonderful it is. And there's telescreens
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.920]  telling you to watch out for terrorists. And they're going in Walmart and the citizens
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.960]  are spying on each other. And it's to stop the drugs, which we all know are grown in
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.400]  Afghanistan under the military's watchful gaze. It is off the charts how the system
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.880]  isn't trying to hide the authoritarian system now. It's coming out with it in the most absurdist,
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.240]  ridiculous, over-the-top way, hiding it in plain view.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.800]  Now, we have a very eloquent gentleman joining us. Always enjoy reading his articles and
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.600]  also watching speeches he gives. Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize winning American journalist,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.640]  author, and war correspondent specializing in American politics and Middle Eastern politics
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.800]  and societies. Currently a senior fellow at the Nation Institute in New York City.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.760]  He was a foreign correspondent for the New York Times for 15 years. He has reported for more than
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:22.760]  50 countries. And he's got a bunch of best selling books, latest the world as we know it.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.680]  And he is, as you know, suing. We appreciate him coming on in such a busy schedule right now.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:35.080]  He started a class action suit over the indefinite detention law because we've seen whistleblowers
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.160]  and journalists that talk to him now being persecuted. And the way this is written,
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.080]  it affects journalists. So he joins us to talk about this and the state of the world.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.560]  Chris, great to have you on with us.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.680]  Thank you.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.400]  Do you ever pinch yourself and think that you might be asleep?
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.480]  I think the rest of the country is asleep.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:00.200]  Well, that's certainly true. Well, give us your take on the NDAA and why you've decided to
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.760]  carry out this class action suit.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.040]  Well, the lawyers actually approached me because they needed a credible plaintiff.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.280]  And since I had been the Middle East Bureau chief of the New York Times
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.480]  and had been in the region for seven years, I'd had frequent contact with both individuals
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:21.000]  and groups that are defined by the U.S. State Department as either terrorists or terrorist
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.680]  organizations. That would include Hamas, Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the old BLO, I used to go to Tunis
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:34.280]  and see Arafat and Abu Jihad when they were both branded as international terrorists, the Kurdistan
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:40.600]  Workers' Party or the PKK. So the language of the bill offers no exemptions for journalists.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:47.960]  It is amorphous and frightening, you know, nebulous terms like substantially supported
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:52.920]  associated forces. And in the reading of these lawyers, and I think, frankly, a lot of lawyers,
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:14:02.200]  it leaves a lot of room for the state to use the military, overturning over 200 years of domestic
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:08.600]  law as a policing agent to snatch American citizens from American soil, strip them of due
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:15.240]  process and hold them in military detention facilities, including Guantanamo. So it is a
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.920]  staggering assault against our constitutional rights. And I certainly agreed to be a plaintiff.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.320]  It's not a class action suit. We're not asking for money. We're just asking for the law to be
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:32.600]  overturned. They're assigning a judge in the Southern District Court in New York. And if we
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:38.680]  can move quickly, hopefully we can get an injunction because this legislation is supposed
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.160]  to go into effect in March. Okay, so to correct that, the media, when I was reading from got
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:48.040]  that wrong, I guess they may have said class action cuz other reporters can join if they
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:53.720]  have standing or is that not the case? They haven't gone out and I mean, I think that mine
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:15:01.160]  is such a peculiar history that they feel they don't really need- Got it. They don't need,
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:07.320]  I mean, there aren't many Americans who've spent the kind of time that I have with these
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.600]  groups. So they feel it's, I'm pretty solid as a plaintiff. So they're not going and looking
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.080]  for other plaintiffs. So basically you have the perfect standing as the former New York Times
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.240]  Bureau Chief over there and as your job meeting with all these groups. I mean, I would be
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:29.240]  genuinely concerned because they all claim at the time, the establishment did, the authoritarian
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:34.200]  supporters at the Patriot Act wouldn't be used in non terror related cases or on citizens.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.840]  Now they admit it's used thousands of times a year per state, even at the state level.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:44.120]  I mean, they're using all of this. Well, this is an important point. When they passed the 2001
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.840]  legislation, what we got was this sort of radical interpretation of it by
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.840]  Bush's legal advisor, John Yoo and others. And that's Jose Padilla, who is an American citizen,
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.440]  allegedly was one of the hijackers who didn't make it on a plane, held for three and a half
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:08.520]  years by the military. Now that is a situation gets challenged legally, goes to the Supreme
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.600]  Court. And before the Supreme Court rules, Padilla is turned over to a civilian court.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:19.640]  The Supreme Court would not rule on it, rendering, saying that it was now moot. I think they just
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:25.080]  sort of, it became a way for them not to wade into that controversy. We have Anwar Al-Awlaki,
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:31.160]  a Yemeni cleric, and the executive branch, again, using that 2001 legislation,
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.720]  serves as judge, jury and executioner, although he is a US citizen and orders his assassination.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:48.600]  So, yeah, I mean, it is, this essentially codifies into place, legalizes this kind of activity.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:56.200]  And, and I think importantly, it frees the state up from going after groups that, under the old
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.240]  legislation, you couldn't do this unless people were directly tied to Al-Qaeda, or had some kind
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:09.560]  of tangential involvement in 9-11. Now, you can go after groups that didn't even exist in 2001.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.680]  These so-called associated forces, I mean, a lot of these groups in Yemen and Somalia weren't even
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:20.360]  around in 9-11. So, yeah, it's pretty serious.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:25.560]  Well, it certainly is. Look, there was a Liberty Dollar case, you probably didn't see it,
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:34.280]  but the Associated Press and other publications wrote about it. And Bernard Von Notthouse had the
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.720]  Royal Hawaiian Mint and all these other groups putting out commemorative coins. Well, they put
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:48.360]  out a Liberty Dollar. And in the after conviction ruling for counterfeiting, the FBI and the US
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:54.200]  attorney said, this guy's a domestic terrorist. He's a unique form of terrorism. And so we want
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.720]  the full 22 years that he can get for this. So I've more and more in cases also hear them
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:05.800]  use that terrorism term. And we see the military industrial complex building up, we have no fly
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:12.440]  lists that you can't find out how you get on the list or how you get off all these domestic spying
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:19.240]  agencies. We've gotten the Mayak and Homeland Security reports that list gun owners, libertarians,
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:27.240]  anti-war activists as affiliated with terrorism. So I mean, I see this being used across the board.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.560]  I mean, even the senators involved that supported it said, you bet it affects citizens when there
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:37.560]  was a debate about that, the NDAA. We killed the Lockheed, we'll kill citizens if we want.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:43.880]  And then Lieberman said, we wanna scare people. I'm sure you've probably seen those creepy quotes.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:50.600]  Yeah, well, there's no question if you read the legislation that this includes American citizens.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:59.080]  And there's also no question that it's a direct and egregious violation of our constitutional
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.880]  rights. Now, the lawyers feel that because of that, it has a pretty good chance of getting
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:11.560]  to the Supreme Court, but the court's so stacked with corporate stooges that we're not at all sure
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:17.880]  that it's gonna get through the Supreme Court, that the Supreme Court will either hear it or
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:27.720]  rule in our favor. So I mean, I think it's still worth doing and it's important. And you're right.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.760]  I mean, look at what happened in the drug wars. I mean, first they institute testing for prisoners,
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.560]  then they institute testings for people looking for jobs and people applying for welfare. I mean,
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.280]  it always creeps out where you don't wanna hand the state these kinds of powers. And if there is
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:48.600]  any kind of serious unrest, if the power elite feels threatened from whatever, from popular
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:53.800]  movements, this essentially allows them to call in the army. And I don't know what the motives
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.240]  to the bill is. I mean, I do find it interesting that all of the intelligence agencies, the FBI,
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:03.960]  the CIA, the National Intelligence Agency, even the attorney general's office were against this
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:08.680]  piece of legislation. The Pentagon was against it. So you have to ask, why does it pass? Why is it
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:14.840]  being pushed through? Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI, actually went up to Congress and
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.720]  testified that passing this legislation would make the work of the FBI more difficult because
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:25.160]  it would be harder to get people to cooperate if you extend these kinds of powers to the military,
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:32.680]  and yet it passes anyway. And I think the way the legislation is written, it gives a kind of iron
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:39.720]  bar to those who wanna crush internal dissent. Maybe they don't trust the police finally to
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.720]  protect them. And this allows them to call in the US military.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:49.880]  Yeah, for those that haven't read the bill, it gets rid of posse commentatis. It also declares
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.680]  that they can basically kill anybody globally whenever they want, which I really see as a
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:00.280]  transference of war powers completely out of Congress into the office of the presidency.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:05.640]  Right, and that was the battle between Carl Levin's office and the White House. It was never
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.320]  over the denial of due process. It was over the fact that Obama wanted these powers in his hands.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:20.040]  And he wanted the ability to either target, i.e. select those who would be targeted or offer them
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.680]  exemptions. And he got it, that's what he got. But there was never an argument at all. Diane
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:30.680]  Feinstein actually proposed language that would have exempted American citizens. And both the
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.720]  Obama White House and the Democratic leadership turned it down.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:39.880]  So we're talking about divine right of king type stuff, but generally even kings in ancient Europe
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:46.120]  and feudal times, as you know, had to trump up something. This is just, we'll do whatever we
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:53.800]  want. But don't worry, Obama and Mitt Romney have both said, you can trust us, we won't abuse this.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:59.560]  Well, Obama issued a signing statement that said that it would not be used on American citizens.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.400]  Well, that begs the question, then why didn't you put that in the legislation?
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:09.400]  The legislation does permit these kinds of draconian forms of control, stripping of legal
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.720]  rights to be carried out against US citizens. So if it's not your intent to use it on American
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.400]  citizens, then you should have put that in the bill.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.520]  Well, Chris, that's what's even scarier. I want to get your view on this. Again,
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.000]  a Pulitzer Prize winner, best selling author, researcher, journalist, Chris Hedges is our guest.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:29.880]  Why also the exercise of deception? I mean, early on two months ago, it doesn't affect citizens and
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:36.200]  it has that deceptive language where it says you're exempt, except this section says you're not.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.520]  And then they deny it affects citizens for a while, then the White House says they're against
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:46.840]  it, then they blame Carl Levin. He says, hey, you told us to do this. And then after it passes,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:54.200]  we see this victory lap by Graham and others of the senators saying, you bet it affects citizens,
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:23:00.520]  it affects citizens, almost like a weird celebration with hopping up and down by some
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:07.160]  of the senators. I mean, this is like a science fiction movie with caricatures of bad guys.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.360]  Well, because it's like Obamacare, they figure no one's gonna read it.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.920]  Actually, this is quite readable. You can pull it up on the web, it's not that long.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:22.200]  Obamacare is 2000 pages of corporate malfeasance. So they're just assuming that people won't read
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:29.240]  the legislation and they spin it. But it's completely disingenuous, that's a very kind
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.120]  word to use about the Obama White House and their characterization of what this bill does.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:38.440]  I mean, it's pretty clear, you don't have to go to Harvard Law School to figure out
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.080]  what they're saying. I wanna talk more about your case and so many other issues and limited time we
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.920]  have with you. But separately, you probably haven't heard it because it just happened
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:52.840]  yesterday. We played the clip in the last hour. Rush Limbaugh has come out and said basically
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:58.280]  that Ron Paul, Rand Paul, both complained about being detained and harassed by TSA and groped.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.520]  That they sound like Islamic terrorists and deserve, and I'm reading quotes here,
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:09.480]  that the TSA needed to do this. And so now we're even starting to hear,
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.000]  well, Ron Paul doesn't want a war with Iran, he's with the terrorists.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.480]  It doesn't matter if, as you mentioned, most of the experts in the CIA and the government
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:25.880]  say don't have a war. It doesn't matter if the whole TSA thing is blatantly unconstitutional.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.680]  We're now even hearing kind of the neocon mouthpieces more and more talk about public
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:38.600]  figures as being terrorists. Well, I hadn't heard that. I mean, there's a reason corporate sponsors
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:44.200]  pay him for, what does he earn, $4 million a year? I think it's more like $15 million a year.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.080]  Is he really? Yeah, he's got $100 million contract, yeah.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.440]  Is he really? Yeah.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:53.320]  Well, I mean, let's follow the money. I mean, who does he work for, who pays him,
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.840]  and why does he say it? And why is he getting that much money? The rest of us don't get that
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:05.720]  much money. What is your view of Ron Paul overall on the whole war issue? Because the corporate
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.760]  media tries to act like he's crazy, but I mean, the former head of the Mossad agrees with him.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.600]  The last two Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with him on Iran. I mean,
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.240]  most of the experts agree with him, but then there's this hoax that people that don't want
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.640]  a bunch of new wars are the bad guys. No, on the issue of the wars,
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.720]  I'm totally in agreement with Ron Paul, and I speak as somebody who spent a lot of time in Iran,
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:35.160]  and of course, a lot of time in the region. An assault on Iran would just be catastrophic.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:41.240]  It would trigger a regional war, not to mention thousands and thousands of dead, because most of
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:47.160]  these facilities are built in highly densely populated areas. So it would trigger a kind of
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:55.080]  war of Shi'ism. Remember, Iraq is 60% Shia. No, it's just, yeah. So on the issues of the war,
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:02.760]  I think, and not only the war, but the issue of internal activity by the security and surveillance
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.920]  state. I think Ron Paul's one of the few voices, I don't know if he's in the mainstream, but
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.440]  at least he can get up on the debates. He's one of the very few voices that is speaking out.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:20.760]  Getting back specifically to your lawsuit, what's the timetable on this? When will we know?
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:29.640]  And what is your lawsuit basically declaring? It's asking that the law be annulled because
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:36.760]  it's unconstitutional, that we're not asking for anything else. Now, if they've assigned a judge,
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:43.000]  we're trying to find out who it is. If we know the records of the judges, which are actually not bad
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:50.120]  on civil liberties in the Southern District Court, and if they feel that the judge is open to hearing
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:58.440]  this case, they'll push for litigation before March so that they can delay the law. They can
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:06.040]  have the law essentially put an abeyance until the case is heard, which that is the current tactic.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:15.560]  Chris, going back to why the system is doing this, I've got another angle I want you to comment on
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:22.440]  and get your take on. I have seen this NDAA and the SOPA bill and all of this wake people up who
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:28.600]  were asleep like nothing I've ever seen before. I mean, I'd say the response is 10, 15 times what
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:34.520]  the Patriot Act was. A, are you seeing it wake people up? And B, why do you think it's starting
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:42.680]  to wake people up? Well, I think there's all sorts of intrusions into our life that are no longer
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:51.000]  theoretical. The passage of the Pfizer reform bill in essence makes legal what under our
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.560]  Constitution has traditionally been illegal and does so retroactively. The warrantless wiretapping,
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:02.120]  monitoring, and eavesdropping of tens of millions of Americans. The SOPA bill, as you pointed out,
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.880]  I mean, I think it's just too hard to ignore. My understanding is that the polling on the NDAA is
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:12.360]  that only between two and nine percent of the American public supports it. This has no public
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.680]  support. The Pfizer Reform Act didn't have any public support either. There are powerful
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:23.480]  corporate forces that want to ram it through because it protects them and this narrow oligarchic
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:30.840]  elite. But it's left a really bad taste in the mouths of the vast majority of the American public.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:38.920]  And this is not a left-right issue. You have even figures like Rick Santorum denounced it. It has to
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.720]  do with the basic issue of civil liberties, which cuts across the political spectrum. So at least
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.080]  on the ground, I think the vast majority of Americans seem to be behind us. Whether the courts
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.520]  will rule on behalf of the citizens or rule finally on behalf of the corporations,
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.600]  we'll have to find out. Well, I was about to raise the left-right issue.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:05.160]  Issues like the TSA, warrantless wiretaps, secret arrest, torture. This is something unifying
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:12.120]  America. And it's really becoming clear that it's a tag team with the Republicans and Democrats,
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.000]  and that for all intents and purposes, it's a corrupt political corporate ruling class
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.160]  that is authoritarian and that is dangerous and that is growing like a cancer.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.480]  Well, that's my take. Well, let's get your take on the world.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.880]  Talk about your latest book in just five, six minutes we have left on the other side with
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:35.000]  Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize winning American journalist, author and war correspondent, former
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.680]  head of the New York Times Bureau in the Middle East. We'll be right back with our guest
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.960]  straight ahead and we'll give you his website as well. Stay with us.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:16.120]  Check since you were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a

[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.600]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:11.560]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:16.280]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:21.640]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three,
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:26.600]  in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.560]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:36.680]  to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.640]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.320]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:52.280]  oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.240]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:16.680]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:21.720]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The silver lungs generator infuses
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:27.720]  the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:33.560]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:39.480]  of nano silver products. You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:45.240]  lungs generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:52.040]  and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.440]  of the silver lungs generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:18.920]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central we're here live. I come back live Sundays,
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:25.400]  4 to 6 p.m. We also have Infowars Nightly News and infowarsnews.com that we've been beta testing
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:30.200]  the last five months for television that prisonplanet.tv viewers can watch. We have a
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:35.080]  15-day free trial subscription running right there. And then of course those of you that
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.680]  support the site you're basically paying for it for everybody else which is great.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.840]  We then put it on YouTube and everywhere else a few days later and it gets millions of views
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:49.240]  every week and it's only five months. In existence we're putting a lot of time and energy obviously
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:54.200]  into this. More energy than we do even in the radio show. So if you're not a viewer of it
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:00.520]  now is the time to support the alternative true independent media. Now going back to Chris Hedges,
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:06.600]  the best website to read his amazing essays is truthdig.com forward slash Chris Hedges.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.680]  That's truthdig.com forward slash Chris Hedges. Also I was asking which book he thinks is the
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.080]  most important right now and it's actually not his group of essays from last year the world as
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:22.120]  we know it. It's a death of the liberal class. And I wanted in the six, seven minutes we have
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:28.520]  left with him to kind of give him the floor to talk about whatever he thinks is most important
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:33.080]  and where he sees this society going right now. Chris?
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:39.000]  Well I think that the mistake is that the liberal class is somehow meant to be the political left.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:46.040]  The liberal class is a kind of safety valve that makes incremental and piecemeal reform possible.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:52.760]  That's what you saw with Roosevelt and the New Deal. And what's happened is that essentially
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:59.000]  traditional liberal politicians as well as the Democratic party have become completely hostage
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.520]  to corporate power. So you get the rise of self-identified liberals like Bill Clinton
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.440]  who push through NAFTA, which is the greatest betrayal of working men and women in this country
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:19.480]  since the Taft-Harley Act, who deregulate the FCC so that Rupert Murdoch and Clear Channel can buy
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:26.120]  up thousands of stations, who rip down the firewalls between commercial and investment banks
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.960]  known as the Glass-Steagall Act. All this is done under Clinton, including of course the destruction
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:38.040]  of welfare. So these are a kind of betrayal of core liberal values done by the liberal
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:43.240]  establishment for corporate money. And Clinton knew that if he did corporate bidding, he would
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:48.840]  get that money. So that by the 1990s, the Democratic party in terms of corporate dollars
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:54.120]  has fundraising parity with the Republicans, and by the time Barack Obama runs for president
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:01.640]  in 2004, he gets more. And that is the issue. That the popular movements, the populist movements
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:09.240]  that expressed the sentiments from the base, whether those were old labor unions or the
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:15.160]  Wobblies or an independent press, they were pretty much destroyed in the Red Scare.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.760]  And you just mentioned the attacks against Ron Paul in the name of sort of being soft on
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:28.680]  terrorism, or I think you even said that he was accused of being a terrorist himself.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.680]  I mean, that's what they would have done 50 years ago to discredit him. They would have said he's
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:39.240]  soft on communism. It's exactly the same kind of iconography, the same kind of language that's
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:45.720]  used by the power elite to discredit legitimate criticism and legitimate dissent. And I think
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:52.840]  that that's what's happened. The anger over the liberal class is not misplaced. People have been
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:37:00.520]  betrayed by these figures like Obama, like Clinton, like Pelosi, like Carl Levin, like the
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:07.480]  leadership of the Democratic party that speaks in that traditional feel your pain language, and yet
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:13.720]  carries out policies that are as craven to corporate interests as those that are carried out
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.080]  by the Republican party. Well, looking at these big corporate interests, I mean, we see people
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:24.920]  like the head of MF Global making 40 to one bets with other people's money. Corzine gets caught
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:30.600]  lying in Congress. The head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says, no, we were there.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:35.560]  He knew, of course, he gave the order to take the private accounts, and no one gets in trouble. I
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:41.960]  mean, there's a new level of just getting away with everything. And when you learn that this
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:50.680]  corporate insider crony capitalist class is running things and are so hubris filled, or maybe
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:55.560]  it's not hubris, maybe they are godlike now because of corruption and because of the public's
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.680]  weakness or whatever, that they can make 40 to one bets. I mean, that shows that these people
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:05.800]  are insane. Well, look at Goldman Sachs. They're bailed out with taxpayer money,
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:13.000]  and then they're given virtually interest-free loans to gamble. I mean, you sort of can't lose.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.680]  I don't know what to call it. It's not capitalism. And there's been no punishment except for Bernie
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:25.800]  Madoff, and that's cuz he stole from rich people. Nobody gets punished. I mean, these people are
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.640]  all back doing what they were doing before, except now they're doing it with our money.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.960]  And at a higher level, you're right, derivatives. What about people like Cass Sunstein openly
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:39.880]  putting out papers saying, we'll arrest people we disagree with, but first, we'll just have
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:45.640]  takedown orders of their sites on the web, and then we see that in SOPA. I mean, the thing is
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:52.680]  they're so honest about their authoritarianism, and then we get criticized for being gloom and
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.360]  doomers. Yeah, well, they are rather amazingly honest about it because they think they're
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:05.000]  untouchable, and you see that with the kinds of statements made by figures like Lloyd Blankfein
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.320]  from Goldman Sachs. God's work. They own the process. They know they own the process,
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:21.000]  and they feel that there is no, and they're right internally, there is no power that can touch them,
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:27.400]  either from the judicial branch or the legislative branch. And that's why I think they see the rise
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:32.840]  of the Occupy movements and other grassroots movements as such a threat because that anger
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.560]  and that outrage is being expressed outside the system. And so they're looking for all
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.440]  the tools they can, whether it's SOPA or the NDAA or anything else, to crush it.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:52.680]  Well, you're right. And I mean, in closing, at first, they tried to co-opt it. And when we saw
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:56.680]  all these big bank heads endorse it and Obama endorse it, but as soon as they couldn't co-opt
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:03.160]  it, we now learn there was simultaneous Homeland Security coordination, sweeping them off the
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:10.280]  streets, violating basic bill of rights, like Tiananmen Square or something. I mean, it's really
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.480]  scary. And I think what's gonna bring these guys down, I want your take on this in closing, Chris,
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.080]  we appreciate your time, is their own hubris that they think that they can get away with anything,
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:28.200]  and that they're going to start a war with the wrong group or engage in too many Ponzi bets.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:33.720]  I mean, take 888. We now know from DC insiders that came out in New Yorker magazine,
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:39.400]  that Cheney, basically with NATO, tried to test Russia and see if they could push into
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.440]  South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And the Russians rolled in missiles, they're chairman of their
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.760]  Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was on European TV, but not here, cuz we're kept in the dark,
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:53.640]  and said, okay, we're gonna use nuclear weapons on the NATO forces landing in southern Georgia.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.920]  And the United States and NATO blinked and pulled back. But it shows
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:05.720]  that if we're being run by a bunch of craven old men with bionic hearts, who are so unstable,
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:08.680]  that they would mess with Russia just to see what would happen.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:15.240]  I mean, I think we're all in just incredible danger of cataclysms because of these people.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:22.120]  Yeah, I think it's a corrupt and pretty rotten elite, which is probably more fragile than we
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.640]  suspect. I think you're right to point out the closure of the 18 encampments, all done
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.040]  simultaneously and coordinated, because that exposed what they have to offer,
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:39.800]  which is essentially force. Instead of responding to the legitimate demands that push people into
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:47.560]  those encampments, they try to physically erase them. And instead of addressing the foreclosures
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:54.760]  and bank repossessions, the massive unemployment, the staggering student debt, they think they can
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.320]  wipe these encampments and the problem will go away. And I think that's a window into how
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.240]  calcified and out of touch they are. Yeah, and instead, it's probably gonna
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:07.800]  cause a violent revolution, which, as you know, usually doesn't go too well in history.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.560]  And I want to try to avoid. Is there any way, in your view, to navigate out of this?
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.200]  Well, you know, I've spent a lot of time with the Occupy movement because as somebody who spent 20
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.160]  years as a work correspondent, I know the poison of violence. I know what it does, you know,
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:32.360]  even when it's used in an ostensibly just cause. I think that we have to push as hard as we can.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:39.000]  I think the state will push back. They clearly already are pushing back. But when legitimate
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.680]  forms of dissent are crushed, you're right, you know, that you inevitably get a violent response.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.560]  I hope we don't get there. And I was arrested in front of Goldman Sachs as part of an Occupy
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:56.840]  demonstration because I think civil disobedience is, at this point, the only weapon that perhaps
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:03.480]  can support this slide into what the political philosopher Sheldon Wolin calls our system of
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:09.400]  inverted totalitarianism. Wow. Well, thank you, Chris, for your time. And people can find the
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:13.720]  latest book. Well, the one you're saying is most important right now, Death of Liberal Class 2010,
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:19.480]  also the world as it is. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks for having me. Thank you.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:26.120]  Well, he's certainly got a lot of courage. He is suing Obama for NDAA. And again, the
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:30.760]  system always tries to make it either or and it's in that nuance that people get confused.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:35.960]  The system knew that there were all these people disenfranchised. In fact, what was it,
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:41.800]  15 suicides or something in the last three days in Morocco, people setting themselves on fire
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:48.120]  because there's millions of people who can't get jobs. These aren't lazy people
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.080]  setting themselves on fire in Morocco. I was reading where the Greeks are putting their
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:59.160]  kids out on the streets cuz they can't feed them. And thousands of Greek islands, they have
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.200]  thousands of islands, are being handed over. Some of them worth millions apiece to private
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:11.320]  brokerage firm heads for debt that Greece signed on to because the fraudsters sold them derivatives.
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:16.840]  Now there's the latest, they're kind of doling them out as they happen. That's Moroccan dies
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:22.840]  after setting himself on fire. I guess that's the latest who died. So all of this is happening
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:29.080]  but then you'll hear me criticizing Occupy Wall Street. No, no, no. The system knows that there's
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:33.320]  people, they've got computerized actuaries. They know there's already demonstrations forming
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.920]  everywhere. I mean, we could predict the Tea Party years before it happened.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.720]  Gerald Cilente could. You could see these trends. Well, they've got computers that do it
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.760]  off of what people are actually writing and saying and doing. These computers thin slice
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.880]  giant sections of data and come up with incredibly accurate projections.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.760]  And so they just put out an announcement. Everybody who's mad at Wall Street corruption
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:45:00.280]  and bailouts show up here. So you get liberals, conservatives, libertarians, anarchists,
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:05.160]  they're all down there. And then in comes Soros and the White House controlled people.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:08.360]  And they try to go, yes, the answer is raise taxes on the middle class.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.000]  And Warren Buffett comes out and endorses it and says, that's right, do what they say.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.920]  Because he's written the tax laws where he's exempt. So is Mitt Romney. Again,
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:27.080]  you're taught it's either rich guys or poor people. No, no, no, normal middle class folks
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.800]  worth a million bucks, 5 million, 300,000, whatever it is, that whole strata.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.000]  That's who actually gets their hair cut, buys clothes, goes to a golf course, puts their kid
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.480]  in college, buys electronics, goes to your restaurant. The bigger the middle class,
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.240]  the more prosperous. Because people in the working class can then get into that class.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.480]  And it swells, but the bigger the middle class, always the freer is society.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.800]  And the tinier the elite, and the fact that they can't monopolize control.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.280]  And they don't like that, they wanna be in charge.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.400]  And just as Chris Hedges said, this isn't even capitalism. See, the Occupy people with the George
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.200]  Soros signs that trucks were pulling up on record handing out fake signs that looked like they were
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:18.840]  homemade was in capitalism, in the free market. Capitalism didn't do this. This isn't capitalism
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:24.280]  where six banks run the government and steal 27 trillion and buy up the media with it.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:32.600]  And then we've gotta bail them out. And then they loan us our money back and then lecture us.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:42.040]  I mean, I'll see Larry Summers, and I'll see Geithner, and I'll see Clinton,
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.320]  and I'll see all the people that engineered the end of Glass-Steagall.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.440]  And boy, they sort of get in the military ready for martial law the minute they did,
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.280]  cuz they knew where this was going. You build a bubble like that, that's an awesome thing to do.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:59.160]  And when it pops, look out. Well, they're gonna, out of that chaos, they get power as it pumps up,
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:05.080]  but they get the real power when it implodes. And I was reading the people at the Davos event
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:10.920]  this morning, John Baum printed it off for me. And I mean, it's the Rothschilds,
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.840]  the Rockefellers, the royalty, all of the elites, kind of like a public Bilderberg meeting.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:23.080]  And they come out and say, we're here to have a new capitalism where we're gonna raise taxes to
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.480]  help the poor. We're gonna get the rich people. And they have all these rich guys sit there and say,
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:35.560]  I only pay 4% tax, and that's not fair. I only pay 2%, I only pay 10. Well, Mitt Romney,
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:40.680]  he pays 15. That's not right. You know what? We've always been totally greedy,
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:45.720]  and it'll destroy your companies to consolidate them. But now we care, raise the taxes.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:52.280]  And then you actually see the tax plan? It cuts the taxes for the elite, who already
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:56.280]  pay almost no tax. It says, we're just gonna give you a tax holiday. You can bring back your
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:01.000]  18 trillion back into the United States out of the Cayman Islands tax-free.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.400]  That'll, yeah, let's cut your taxes to zero, because most of the money is bailout money
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.600]  you've already got. And you'll never hear this from a neocon talk show host,
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:20.040]  because they're owned by these people. Instead, the neocons will fight the controlled opposition
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.520]  left calling for socialism and communism and endocapitalism. But who's financing it?
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:31.400]  The very same big bankers to then have the blue collar public and the welfare class under them
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.480]  attack what's left of the middle class. And the globalists are offshore exempt from all of it
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.360]  in a big joke. And then now the system's pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing for armed conflict with
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:46.360]  the American people. Training the military, training the police, trying to get a civil
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:50.360]  war going. And again, they're all gonna sit offshore while we all kill each other.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:56.280]  And I know all these vets and people out there who publicly say,
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.480]  when this all goes down, look out police and military that come after us.
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:05.560]  You know what, that makes my heart hurt. Sure, I don't like some arrogant roid head cop that
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.960]  likes to beat people up or some military person that's dumb enough to go up against domestic
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:15.400]  groups. But I know they're gonna be following some brainwashing template, some cover story.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:23.080]  And I care about them. I'm beyond macho folks. I'm beyond tough guy to the point of I don't
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:28.280]  wanna go there. I wanna defeat the actual controllers. I'm not all, I'll just have a war
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:34.840]  with the local cops. Local cops are just like your neighbor, just like the general public.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.480]  They have no idea what's going on. We've got to instead of just buying guns, which I do think is
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:44.120]  a good backup, we gotta defend ourselves. Let's not make a mistake about that. But if you're to
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:48.360]  the point of buying a bunch of guns, getting ready for war, and just ready. There are a lot of folks,
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.200]  I wanna warn the police and military, as you know, who wanna die, who don't care.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.720]  I mean, if you think their restraint is because they're afraid of you and your black uniforms
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:01.960]  scare them, it's the opposite. It enrages real men, who are real men, but aren't sophisticated
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.880]  enough to understand all this. They're just ready to kill a bunch of you. And man, I would not wanna
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.680]  be in your position with what the New World Order is trying to push you into. So if a lot of people
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:17.000]  are talking about war with the government, why don't you engage in info war first?
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.040]  Why don't you try to turn this around without total war in the streets, blood in the streets?
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:28.600]  Why don't we try to point out capitalism didn't do this, point out the free market develops the best
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:32.840]  economies, and the wealthiest general public, and is the best for everybody.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:38.360]  And point out how a small group of banksters are anti-free market and anti-family,
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.320]  and are setting all this up and selling socialism as the solution to what they've done,
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.400]  because it creates command and control economies that shuts down all their competition.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:55.000]  It is so essential to get that message of truth out, or the cops are gonna follow the
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.880]  left for communism, or they're gonna follow the controlled right for fascism. We don't want either
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:06.200]  one. That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:10.680]  Okay, here's the deal. We're going to have open phones throughout the third hour today,
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:14.920]  jam-packed with a lot of factoids and news pieces I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:20.360]  But up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, Soros mouthpiece calls on Google
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:28.360]  to police conspiracy theorist. And it's not just Cass Sunstein, but Stanford scholar wants
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.640]  search engines to flag global warming vaccine skepticism as thought crime.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:39.240]  Now, you heard me play an AP video at the start of the hour, where they actually say the latest
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:47.240]  pre-crime system, and you're not watching Minority Report. They're actually saying it's pre-crime,
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:54.680]  and saying how great it is. And then it reads through here, and they're writing articles for
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:00.440]  Slate, there's White House announcements. Cass Sunstein, they're openly talking about
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:06.680]  shutting down websites and then arresting people. I mean, these are authoritarians.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:12.760]  I mean, there's no ifs, ands, or buts. And then you got Limbaugh saying, well,
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.400]  Ron Paul deserves to be stopped by TSA. He's a Muslim terrorist. I mean, what?
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:24.840]  And it's not funny. I'm not gonna put up with you globalist traitors claiming we're the traitors.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:32.120]  I'm sick of it. Now, speaking, this is weird. I've seen this five, six, seven years ago,
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:38.120]  about six months ago, I just typed into YouTube, George Soros, 60 Minutes interview.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:44.280]  And you would get, I'm not joking, dozens and dozens, page after page, of him on 60 Minutes,
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:52.840]  I think it was about 1999 or 2000. Actually, I have the date here. 1998 interview with Steve
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:57.400]  Croft, where he talked about how great it was working with the Nazis, and he doesn't feel bad
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:05.000]  about it. He must have had all of that expunged off of the web when Glenn Beck talked about it
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.840]  earlier in the year, copying our show, talking about it, which is fine. I'm glad.
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:14.120]  It's like an auxiliary of my broadcast. I'm very proud of it, actually. I am. Have we come up with
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:18.440]  a new special on the website? He copies it exactly. The truth lives there. I always said the truth
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:22.920]  lived here. Give the gift of truth at Christmas, he gives the gift of truth. I love it. I mean,
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:27.320]  it's like a clone, like a little twisted clone, but he's getting closer to me, so that's good.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:33.880]  It's good to see my son coming along. But here's from the Zionist Organization of America. It's
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:42.760]  troubling to see the Jewish leaders defend Israel. US basher. Again, it's troubling to see Jewish
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:47.080]  leaders defend Israel US basher George Soros against Glenn Beck's criticism. And then they
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:56.360]  actually have the transcript here of George Soros talking about working for the Nazis.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.720]  And I'm gonna go over this transcript and everything tonight, but here's the deal. We're
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:05.720]  getting hundreds of emails. Nobody else can find it now. It's been removed from the bit torrents.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:11.240]  It's been removed from YouTube, Google Video. It's been removed everywhere. If you find it,
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:19.000]  you need to save it. And it's from 1998. I played clips of this years ago.
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:27.560]  1998 interview. That's what we're thinking about Glenn Beck. December 20th, 1998, Steve Croft.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:34.360]  The funny thing is used to, I'd like play a clip of a eugenicist calling for world population
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.960]  reduction and then a month later here on Becky Pooh. But I mean, I'm glad of that.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:43.640]  But I guess when Beck covered it, his show was so big then that they just had it removed.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:50.760]  Cuz I mean, that was like coffin nails to George Soros. Absolute coffin nails. And of course,
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:56.440]  George Soros' media matters is routinely demonizing us and attacking us on pretty much a daily basis.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:01.240]  By the way, Warren Buffett, the rich guy that openly wants to raise taxes on the middle class
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:05.640]  to pay it to himself and make her bailouts. Bloomberg is the guy that's the guy that's
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:10.280]  gonna pay it to himself and make her bailouts. Bloomberg is reporting that Warren Buffett's
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:16.200]  Burlington Northern among winners from Keystone denial. When they shut down that pipeline,
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:22.280]  it'll now be taken by train to the US, but also to the west coast of Canada to be put on tankers
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:29.560]  to China. And Bloomberg reports, so. See, the big guys make their money off government shutting
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.720]  them off. That's why John D Rockefeller, the first said competition is a sin. But the neocon
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:43.480]  talk show host will never tell you that dirty secret. You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:06.760]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home, tremendous influence
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:12.120]  on our president and Congress. And they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:18.040]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:23.640]  enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:28.440]  and on its ashes, constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:32.920]  They're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to today?
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:38.840]  Seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the

[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:33.080]  Jones. Well, we are the cure to the reality television watching fluoride Prozac head
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:41.480]  zombie population under the control of the SES stream, sewer stream, dinosaur globalist,
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:46.280]  treacherous traitor, shell out knuckle dragger, teleprompter reader,
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:51.000]  prostitute, New World Order servant, Benedict Arnold media.
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.760]  And I wanna give in the first 30 minutes of this hour, first time callers a chance to call in.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:00.120]  Here's the toll free number to join us. I wanna hear from first time callers.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:03.400]  And then after I take a few rounds of first time callers, we'll go on to others.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:15.880]  800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231. And we'll get you up and on the air a little bit later in the
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:24.040]  transmission. A little bit later as in the next segment. Some of the other crazy news I've got,
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.400]  I haven't gotten to yet. Mitt Romney's released more financials. He basically doesn't pay taxes,
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:36.120]  it's all in offshore banks. But if you make it $200,000 a year, try to save 100,000 of that and
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:40.280]  put it in offshore accounts even after tax, they're gonna take it. They made it almost
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.160]  impossible to get it out. They'll have the IRS rule it's fraud outside of law and take whatever
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:52.520]  you got. Only if you're a big globalist and are in the special club, are you allowed to do this?
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.200]  See, because we live in a two tiered system now. But the globalist can commit any crime they want,
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:04.120]  anytime they want, they have globalist immunity. They basically have new world order immunity from
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:08.920]  laws. And it's the same thing in the European Union, they get away with whatever they want,
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:15.240]  whenever they want. And they're getting closer and closer to that system that Nick Rockefeller
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:21.240]  talked about where the elite basically has a microchip inside their body where no one can
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:25.400]  challenge them, no one can ask them questions. The police cannot touch them, they are immune.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:29.800]  And they can just commit any crime they want and get away with anything they want.
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.720]  And if you dare try to protest against them, the police will come and split your head open.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:38.520]  And the police will have their future destroyed, their children's future destroyed.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:43.560]  And the global eugenicist control freaks will continue to do whatever they want to the
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.920]  environment, put sodium fluoride in the water, vaccines will be poisoned. And they'll write
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:53.240]  white papers on how they're doing it to us. But because the general public is only talking about
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.520]  the NFL playoffs. I was listening to the radio yesterday and you could hear the talking point of
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:05.560]  talking about the Giants, I guess, are going to the playoffs, Super Bowl something, I don't know.
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:10.200]  I don't even know where the playoffs are, what's going on with it? I'm too concerned with
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.720]  the Strait of Hormuz, the Iranians say they're getting ready to shut it.
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:19.560]  The US says they're gonna attack them. Oil prices go up, economy sputters even more.
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:25.320]  We go into deeper depression, larger war could begin. But again, I'm the bad person.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:32.120]  Cuz I hear these men on the radio, they're just like, it's so great, the Giants, man,
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:38.200]  they're my team. Yeah, my wife didn't used to like football, but she came out of the room and
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:44.760]  she said, I really like it now. And I like to watch football by myself and pace up and down
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:50.200]  and yell at the TV and my kids just come in quietly and look at me in awe. The other host
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:56.920]  is like, yeah, I know what you mean. It's so manly. Meanwhile, I'm pacing up and down,
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:00.440]  trying to figure out how to wake people up. I'm pacing up and down, not believing
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.720]  how hardcore the tyranny is. I'm pacing up and down,
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:08.440]  confirming that in the H1N1 shot, they added another virus
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:11.720]  that's a carrier and appears to be some type of binary weapon.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.200]  And it's just killing people and maiming people and the numbers are coming in and the cancer is
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:21.480]  exploding and the death. But I hear these men who are like in this mesmerized cult,
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:27.400]  brainwashed haze, trying to impress each other with how much they love the football.
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:34.120]  And it's just like this form of camaraderie and manhood, not to their tribe, their religion,
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:39.720]  their people, their art, their culture, but this fake plastic garbage.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:47.320]  And the women totally vapid, taught how to be tarts and all their shows, demonizing the men.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.240]  And in every television show, the men are idiots and the women are the bosses and
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:57.320]  the children rule over them. Just cultural death, force fed down our throats by the globalist to
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:03.320]  make us weak. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:07.800]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:12.360]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.440]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:21.640]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:27.800]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:32.280]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:37.400]  any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre of seed in your family.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:45.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call

[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:02.040]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. Did you ever think you'd

[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:17.400]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:22.600]  earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:28.040]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:33.080]  has established an all-powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth
[02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:39.160]  to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship,
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:45.080]  body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.

[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:27.960]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the news is just pouring in. I'm gonna go to your phone calls and then
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.880]  more news. But later in the day, Aaron Dykes is gonna have a special report, a text report.
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:46.040]  Like this is so big, I think I'll shoot a video for it too. Out on infowars.com
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:54.920]  where there's a new congressional report with the Chertoff group, the folks that gave you the
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:09:00.600]  naked body scanners, where they basically admit everything that we've already reverse engineered.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:05.960]  But it's the admissions. We told you TSA would be on the streets of America.
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:09.800]  There'd be naked body scanners everywhere, shopping malls, highway checkpoints.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.760]  That's why they've gotta break your will and do it in the airport to set that precedent.
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.960]  They've got to do it there. They've gotta have federal funds for mobile trucks to take blood
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.200]  forcibly. They've gotta get the police ready to give force inoculations. So they've gotta
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:32.760]  medicalize the police for medical tyranny as their little enforcers. But they want a federal
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:40.920]  kind of brown shirt, minimum wage force, and that's what the TSA is. I know they're a little
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:45.160]  bit more than minimum wage, but compared to police and others, it's a lot lower.
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:50.600]  Who don't even come out of the old systems of the Bill of Rights and Constitution. That's been
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:58.040]  abridged to a great extent. But now they're just doing away with it in its entirety by creating a
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:06.840]  new agency. And ten years into this, you see the tyranny, bureaucratic, arbitrary, constant lying
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:13.720]  to the public, their enemy, the incredible power trips. And the document he was just showing me
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:18.440]  during the break was, Homeland Security will hire everybody in America. He'll have to get
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:22.120]  their approval for a job. We already knew that from the hearings. Here's going C-SPAN, but
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:27.640]  here it is in a document. There'll be checkpoints everywhere. Homeland Security with private
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:34.280]  contractors, so that the establishment types make money, will hire your local police.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.240]  You'll have to get Homeland Security approval, even hire police. They'll be totally federalized,
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:45.000]  and they admit they're gonna respond to all crime. You'll have federal police at every city
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.800]  targeting the American people. And it has no pretense that it's for terrorists.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:56.040]  It's just total federalization of everything by wicked sickening goon forces.
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:01.000]  And he was just showing me these documents, and it's all in Congress.
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.720]  And it is the military industrial complex basically absorbing all of America.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:13.080]  And the biggest group of new in the last decade scholarships
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:18.200]  is every facet of spying, and running the systems, and data mining, and grids,
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:23.160]  and psychology degrees on how to break the American people's will.
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:28.520]  I mean, using our money, just building a giant army of scum and criminals. I mean,
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:33.240]  the government is a narcotics trafficking, child kidnapping, murdering group at the top.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:39.000]  They do it with impunity, and now they are getting ready to totally shut down
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.680]  the entire middle class, impoverish the poor even more, and bring in forced inoculations.
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:47.400]  As the American Medical Association called for last week,
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:51.880]  California passed a law to forcibly inoculate children without parental consent. I mean,
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:57.400]  it's all happening. Legislation to shut down free speech, secret arrest,
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:03.560]  open calls for arresting talk show host, Limbaugh saying Ron Paul deserves to be detained.
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:09.640]  He might be a terrorist. I mean, just the cuckoo-ness is here. Toe to toe
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.320]  with wild eyed criminals is what we are.
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:21.480]  Running around with brown shirts. Hitler hired people for minimum wage,
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:26.200]  the scum of the earth, filth, pot bellies, pedophiles,
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:33.880]  a rampant pedophilia, street thugs, open the prisons up. That was his brown shirts. And that
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:38.200]  is the TSA. I tell you, the New World Order is sophisticated. They know what they're doing.
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:41.000]  And they have just got the scum of the earth working for them.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.280]  And they're now, again, I mean, we already knew this, but they have the document
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.680]  where you pull up at a checkpoint in Florida, Tennessee, Michigan, Texas, wherever. It's
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:54.520]  happening all 50 states now. And the whole highway shut down. You gotta get somewhere.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:57.960]  It takes you like an hour to get up to it if you try to turn around. But you notice they always do
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:01.640]  it on highways now that have the cables they've put up everywhere so you can't turn around.
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:10.360]  So you're stuck there. And when you finally get there, there are cops in some kind of weird,
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.880]  mentally ill, cuz I've seen on the news, pumped out of their mind craze with their fist in balls.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.600]  Almost always the state police wearing Marine Corps drill sergeant hats,
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:26.600]  just crazed like they're a rodeo clown and a bull's about to come out of that gate.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:31.960]  I mean, they're just like, they're about to run into a burning house. And they're just looking
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:36.200]  at you and your wife and your kids just crazed. This is the enemy. This is the enemy. This is the
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:40.920]  enemy. And there's weird potbelly TSA walking around giving orders and everything's all sick
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:46.840]  and filthy. I mean, God, this country is so sick. And they're just gonna turn them loose.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:50.680]  And I saw in Austin, people will go to anti-war rallies. You can type in
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:57.400]  FBI visits anti-war rally mother. And the FBI comes with these weird women and weird,
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:01.080]  it's always a woman man team and they're always look like a body snatcher.
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:06.440]  They always got this weird look in their face, the FBI does, like they're looking at scum. And
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:09.880]  they're just like, we're just here to ask why you're at the anti-war rally, making sure there's
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:15.240]  no plans for violence. Well, of course there's not, why are you here? I'm not gonna talk to you.
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.920]  And there's like, well, here's our car. We just want you to know we're here.
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.600]  And then they just kind of creep back, not turning their back as the mother closes the door.
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.320]  Like body snatchers. I mean, they're just in, they're like filled with demonic entities or
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:33.000]  something. I mean, it's like they're not human. I mean, but really they're just a stupid man and
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.160]  woman on a power trip feeding off trying to scare the woman and getting off on their suburban.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:45.080]  They pull up in and they are scaring everyone because they're little Jack Bowers. No,
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:51.400]  you work for sicko child-kidnapping murderers. Dinecore, Halliburton, New World Order,
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:56.440]  shipping narcotics in, running every crime, jacking your food and water with poisons.
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.400]  You're little nothing errand boys of the most scientific evil the world's ever seen.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.960]  But out of your cowardice and weakness, you're gonna curl up at the feet of the evil.
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:10.440]  And you will help destroy America and you will be judged by your own evil.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:16.360]  But I'm telling you, I mean, you watch the FBI guys
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.560]  and the FBI women in these videos and they all look the same. They always have like this,
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.680]  I can't do it. Let me try to like just imagine what they look like.
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:28.440]  You can pull the video up actually. We can show people watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.720]  I can try to get the eyes like envision what it's like being weak, being empty,
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:38.840]  being totally cowardly. And it's so fearful that I get off on other people's fear.
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:43.400]  And I like being a political officer of the commissar New World Order and the
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:48.520]  apparatchik and going to people's doors. Let me just imagine the criminal, spiritual,
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:52.920]  demonic weakness of it. And then let me try to make the face here.
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:16:12.600]  I can't even do it. I can't do it, but it's like a bottomless scum, bottomless evil,
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:16.680]  bottomless, just giving their soul to every demonic entity you can imagine.
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:23.960]  That's who they are. Just the insufferable little pot-bellied, weak, sissy type who
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:30.760]  think they've got strength and they have nothing. God, I gotta stop right now.
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:38.200]  Just channeling those people is just too painful. I can't even imagine it. No, that's not it. Type
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:51.880]  into YouTube, FBI visits woman for going to anti-war rally. There's a bunch of them,
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:55.640]  cuz they mainly prey on women. The cops do knock and talk, you notice in Dallas,
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.920]  the Dallas Morning News reported always at about noon, one o'clock.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:03.720]  They've cased the houses, they know the husband leaves. They mark it down on a sheet beforehand
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:07.640]  as part of a spying grid for the feds. Then they go and talk to your wife and ask if they
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:13.000]  can come in and see your legal guns. They're just practicing a criminal operation, practicing
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:19.480]  a sacrament of their treason. It's a religion of desecrating our republic.
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:25.560]  I said I'd take your phone calls. I shouldn't even have thought about the face of that FBI woman.
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.840]  That's the same face that's taken down so many countries. My God,
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:38.040]  no, they have no idea what they're opening. Doesn't matter, they'll soon find out. Greg
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.960]  in California, Greg, you're on the air, go ahead. Hey, hello, Alex. Yes, sir.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:50.040]  Yeah, hey, I wanted to say hi, I'm calling from California, West Sacramento actually.
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:56.920]  Hey, awesome job. I listened to you every day and so does my other friend that came with me.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.680]  We went up there. We met you in Coconut Grove back in October of 2010. Yeah, that was great
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:08.520]  coming to that event. We had two sellout crowds, like 900 each night. Yeah, you were doing awesome.
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:13.240]  And that was the night also when the one sheriff, Sheriff Mack was there with you. And
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.720]  you know, it's awesome that you have good people on your side. And, you know, I've been doing a
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:25.240]  lot of my own. I put your stickers on my car, arrest the feds, you know, all that stuff.
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:30.840]  I mean, and the fed, arrest the bankers. You know, it's all true. It's just so crazy out
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:35.160]  there that there's people out there that just don't see it yet. But a lot of people are waking
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:42.680]  up, thank God. But I wanted to make a, I wanted to say something about the election when Ron Paul,
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:48.120]  Mitt Romney, and I forget who the other one was, but they were all tied at 23%. And it was,
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:55.960]  it made me wonder because they showed Ron Paul and Mitt Romney tied at 23%.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:03.480]  And then it dropped. Ron Paul went from 23 to 21. I swear, I recorded it on my TV and I thought,
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:09.400]  how is this going on? Sir, CBS is reporting he's gonna get zero delegates in Iowa now.
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:14.840]  They're corrupt. I mean, why don't these people- I mean, sir, on record, he's supposed to get
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:20.040]  the third amount, which is a whole bunch of them. I mean, they just don't care. They just,
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.840]  they know the public only knows about football. And so, you know,
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:28.920]  Dine Corps can publicly operate in Austin as the CPS grabbing children and nobody cares.
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.720]  I mean, that's what I mean, because it can't happen here, because we got football, man.
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.080]  We got football here. You know, that's not happening.
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.160]  I like football, but I won't watch it every day. I want to-
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:46.360]  No, no, I hear you. I don't hate football either. The point is, is that men sit around and like,
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:49.720]  I really get upset about football. Oh, you're so manly.
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:53.480]  Their whole identity is like running around like little ninnies.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:56.040]  I appreciate your call. I'm gonna try to go to them quicker on the other side.
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:01.400]  Oh, and I haven't even gotten a bunch of the news yet. Stay with us. Oh my gosh. Oh boy.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:08.200]  After work, I just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone. Come on. Don't be like that.
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:14.440]  Who are you? I'm you 20 years ago when you were full of energy, better shape, great attitude,
[02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:18.920]  and you didn't do so bad with the ladies. Now that you're older, your testosterone levels
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:24.120]  are dropping and, well, you're not the guy you used to be. I'd give anything to feel like you

[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:05.640]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in Fukushima,
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:11.240]  Japan and making its way across the entire U.S. continent, contaminating the air, water and food?
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:16.360]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here. As a result, radiation poisoning is a
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:21.800]  distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S. unless you do something to protect yourself. How?

[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:04.760]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid? Did you know that mercury from
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:09.240]  your dental fillings comes off of your teeth both as a vapor and as particles into your body?
[02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:12.920]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:16.920]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60 percent.
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.800]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:26.440]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:30.200]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body
[02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:34.680]  to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:40.280]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured,
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:44.360]  the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful,
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:47.400]  in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:54.360]  It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325.

[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:06.760]  All right, I'm going to take a bunch of calls now and after the break, and then I will get
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:11.560]  into the other news I haven't covered like this. I had this on Sunday at Infowars.com,
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:17.880]  but I didn't cover it on the radio. Atlanta Jewish Times publisher steps down over Obama hit column,
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:25.560]  CBS News reports out of Atlanta. I'm going to comment on this coming up, but the fact that
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:32.040]  he would openly talk like that shows just the complete arrogance that if Obama didn't attack
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:38.920]  Iran, he needs to be dealt with. And that just shows people buying propaganda. Obama is attacking
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:46.040]  Iran inside. Obama is a New World Order warmonger. It just shows the complete false reality people
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:51.800]  live in. I mean, this guy should be arrested. I'll guarantee if I came on air and said,
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:57.720]  get the president and use those words, they would come after me. This is totally sick.
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:02.040]  But again, the president runs nothing. Mike in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:05.320]  Hello? Hey, buddy.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:07.240]  Hello, how you doing? Good.
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:12.760]  Yes, I wanted to tell you, I think the people are missing the point. You are telling them every
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:18.040]  day and what they don't understand is the law is not the law anymore. It's control. The law was the
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:23.480]  law in the past, but now they're using it as a control grid. Like you said, we understand that
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:28.680]  our law is law, but it's not. They're using law as a control thing. Yes, the government is
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:34.840]  illegitimate now and a joke and authoritarian and they admit they are and they're arrogant
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.720]  and crazy and dangerous as it gets and are bringing us into collapse.
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:43.320]  And I'm jumping up and down screaming and yelling because it's freaking me out.
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:50.120]  And I'm concerned. I'm not scared, but I'm energetic and jumping up and down trying to get
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:55.000]  people to be concerned. It'd be like if there was a bunch of fires coming and burning down the city
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.400]  and nobody seemed to care and was walking around like zombies while houses are burning down around
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:04.280]  them. It's very frustrating. Go ahead, sorry. Yeah, and also I want to tell you, also I've
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:08.840]  been looking at what you're saying about all these vaccines. Like my health is not that good.
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:14.680]  I can't be taking a vaccine with my kidneys not working too good. So I went to Lone Star College
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:19.800]  here in Houston, Texas. They're also on the grid. They're setting up the grid here because they
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:26.200]  send street lights and cameras in neighborhoods. And also the college won't let you attend unless
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:31.000]  you take a meningitis vaccine. And I think that's not right because meningitis is a very dangerous
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.880]  virus. And to be pushing that vaccine with us not knowing what's in it, I think that's not-
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:40.040]  By the way, you're right. The meningitis vaccine is one of the most dangerous.
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:44.440]  And meningitis is incredibly rare. And the vaccine they give you in most cases doesn't even protect
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:50.360]  you from the type that's coming in. And it's not even really the law that you have to do that. It's
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:54.760]  a fraud. And look, until three years ago, they told people with kidney trouble or who were
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:59.400]  pregnant or a whole other list not to take vaccines. Now they tell women if you're pregnant,
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:03.880]  take it even more. And then it kills the baby in many cases. That's what I mean.
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:10.280]  It's gotten crazy. The special interest, no, it's gonna kill a bunch of women and deform
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:15.240]  their babies if it doesn't kill them. And they say go ahead with it. And I remember the Houston
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:22.200]  police chief five years ago called for cameras in people's homes. I mean, what did you think of that?
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.560]  Did you hear that AP video where they were saying how great it is to have pre-crime now,
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:30.120]  and that you're a criminal beforehand cuz they say so?
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.080]  I was looking at that. I don't like that. That right there should be a showstopper for people
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:40.360]  to wake up. If they're trying to make you a pre-criminal, then that says a president. Like
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:45.720]  you said, I think they're trying to set so many presidents to put people in jail. Because if you
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:51.400]  get us all in jail on any little charge, they could all of a sudden just hit a switch and start
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:56.440]  sending us to FEMA camps and start annihilating our race. So we need to stand together. And I
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:00.520]  think all the Christians and people that believe in God need to send a letter to the White House
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:07.000]  right now, today, and get all your church groups and church members to go against the evilness in
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.200]  our country right now. We are being taken over by Satan himself. We need to start standing up
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:13.880]  together and getting everybody-
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:18.200]  And I'll tell you what it is here. You're absolutely right. I've always known this was
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:23.800]  coming the day I went to an urban warfare drill in 1998 and saw troops trying to take our guns
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:28.760]  and put us in camps. And they were admitting that. That's when I started really turning into
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:33.720]  the Alex Jones I am today. Because before that, I was just a mainline libertarian like Ron Paul.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:40.760]  And audit the Fed, stuff like that. And so I've known this was coming, and now we're getting
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:48.920]  close. But as it's confirmed, Mike, as it becomes real, it's freaking me out. I mean,
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.560]  they're really gonna do all this. They're really gonna stage domestic terror attacks
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.720]  and blame it on people and probably try to come arrest me and my family.
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:02.440]  And I'm not trying to scare people, folks. I think people have got to have courage.
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:06.600]  I mean, these are bad criminals. And people are like, well, I'm just gonna go along with it.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.680]  Look at how the economy is shutting down. They're bringing tyranny in because they know
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:15.640]  people are gonna get mad when everybody becomes incredibly poor. And I mean, to the point of
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:21.160]  starving to death. They talk about shutting America down. Look at how they shut down that
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:24.920]  pipeline. They're gonna send the oil to China. Look at how they pay companies to leave the
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:30.280]  United States. I mean, the globalists hate America. They've got really bad stuff in store
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:35.480]  for us. They're training the military to secretly arrest and torture. I mean, they're trying to turn
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:42.200]  the military into demons. And because that's not successful, they're training foreign troops now.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:46.760]  God bless you, good to hear from you. Cancer beater, Joseph, Patrick, Doug,
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:30:03.560]  your calls are coming up with a ton of news. Stay with us. When you're out on the road,
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:10.920]  the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:17.560]  you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:24.600]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:34.120]  Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:44.280]  most. Blue diamond gusset's got it, others don't. We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans,
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:49.880]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine gusset comfort
[02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:56.520]  with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:56.520 --> 02:31:03.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:08.040]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:13.000]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:18.360]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:23.240]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:28.920]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:34.120]  problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:38.680]  families lose their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator
[02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:43.160]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:47.960]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:54.760]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:09.560]  people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk. Saving means
[02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:14.280]  to make money. The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you
[02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:18.680]  good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're
[02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:25.240]  using now. Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes,
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:30.520]  deodorants, or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:35.800]  that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:39.560]  something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:46.840]  never done before. Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web

[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:24.600]  We are back.
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:34.440]  We're going to be going back to your phone calls here in just a moment, and then I've got to get
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:38.520]  to the rest of the news. I did cover quite a bit of it earlier. I want to recap a few of the top
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:44.760]  stories, but get to the other stacks here, at least briefly, each piece of news. Separately,
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:48.040]  if you're a radio listener, you probably don't really see what I look like.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.280]  But if you go to info.wars.com, there is a button up at the top that says,
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:59.480]  watch the show live now. And you can watch 20 minutes of it for free. We can't afford to have
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:05.000]  the whole show live and free. It's costing us like $12,000 more a month just to have a little
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:10.600]  20 minute thing free once a day. We're working on some cheaper bandwidth to have it always,
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:16.760]  you know, the daytime show free up there, the video. And then a higher resolution one at
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:22.200]  presentplanet.tv for members and the nighttime show for subscribers, the nightly news.
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:28.600]  And there's always a link under it for the free audio stream and the podcast as well.
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:36.760]  But the point I'm making here is that if you can look at me, you can see that I have lost
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:46.600]  a lot of weight. I have now lost, depending on what scale I use, 37 pounds, 37 pounds.
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:49.640]  And we're gonna do some before and after photos soon. I've just been
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:53.800]  too busy to show it, to actually put a commercial together showing it.
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:35:07.880]  But I'm going to lose another 23, 25 pounds or so. I'm going down from 260 down to about
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:15.400]  180. And quite frankly, I'm just jogging. I've done that before and it didn't work
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.640]  cuz I was always hungry. But because I did research the last year, only put this into
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:26.920]  effect the last two months, I found that it's mineral and vitamin and trace element deficiency
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:37.240]  in the food, in the depleted soils that the animals are eating crops from and that we're
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:43.560]  eating crops from. And more importantly, the sodium fluoride and the other things that they
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:48.600]  put, the hundreds of chemicals they put in the drinking water, those, even though I try to avoid
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:53.320]  it, I still get it at restaurants and places. And it also gets into the food chain itself.
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:59.560]  Those fill up your organs and your thyroid and your glands full of bad stuff. The globalists
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:04.200]  have chosen all the things they put in the water to poison your glands. I mean, they know
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:09.480]  seven fold increase in bone cancer, IQ reduction. They know hyperthyroidism epidemic.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.920]  I mean, there's a reason we lead the world in all these diseases. I mean, the globalists hate our
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:20.760]  guts. They don't just hate Iraqis, they hate us even more. But they know how to soft kill us.
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.200]  They're just getting ready to use the military on us now and wrap the American flag in it.
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:27.800]  A lot of good old boys, folks, would beat a baby's brains out of you,
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:34.920]  said America, wrap the killing in the flag. It's just a mindlessness. Or if you said NFL,
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:39.240]  they just slit their kids' throats. All right, NFL, I'm tough, I'm a man. I mean,
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:44.520]  it's just like that's all that matters, American flag, NFL. If Satan came out
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:50.600]  wearing a cloak of the American flag, they would throw Jesus overboard off a ship and just bow down
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.160]  and just start worshiping. I mean, if they said, are you ready to die and go to Hades?
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:59.240]  They would say, yes, as long as there's American flags. As long as the flames look like American
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:04.840]  flags burning me. Like Marilyn Monroe when she's standing out there on top of that grate with that
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:11.240]  wind blowing up. As long as it's like American flag flames shooting up, they're ready. I mean,
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:15.160]  you could burn the Bill of Rights Constitution in a pit. They'd bow down to it as long as the
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:20.360]  American flag said so. You see, they don't know what patriotism, liberty, and freedom is.
[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:26.680]  They just get off on feeling like they're part of the power structure. They watch drones fly over
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:32.040]  and they think those are my drones. They sit around and watch shock and awe as buildings
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:37.000]  blow up full of families in them and they feel manly. I've actually seen it with family and
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:43.240]  people. They're just like, look at that killer. They'll watch the military channel ten years
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:48.680]  after stuff happens, you just watch it. Get them, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you know what,
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:55.720]  the New World Order is getting you too. I mean, Jay Rockefeller, whenever they passed the NDAA,
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:00.200]  he was just like fist up in the air. Yeah, score against freedom.
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:05.560]  Because the globalist, even though you serve them happily, they've never forgotten your ancestors
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:09.960]  fought them. And the globalists are all about ancestors and bloodlines. So they're gonna
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:15.560]  rout America out and kill that birthright. Doesn't matter how much of a servant of evil you are,
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:18.760]  you're to be destroyed because your ancestors opposed them.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.120]  It doesn't matter, you're gonna be there like a little dog looking up at the barrel of the gun,
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:29.480]  just going, please, master, shoot me. It's kind of like that clip in Time Bandits whenever the
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.960]  devil's sitting there frying and blowing up his own minions. He's like, I'm going to destroy you.
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:42.360]  And they're, thank you, master, thank you. They love it. They try to pull up Time Bandits,
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:49.240]  the devil from Time Bandits. A villain from Time Bandits killing his minions.
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:53.800]  Show a short clip of that, all right, all right. See, the reason I hardly plug videos,
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:56.840]  products, and things, even though it funds our operation and it's stuff I believe in
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.280]  and great products is because I'm always too busy ranting. There's no teleprompters here,
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:05.000]  folks. You get what you get. I'm going to your calls here in just a second. The point is go to
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:12.280]  infoarsteam.com to find the Tangy Tangerine Mineral Vitamin total replacement.
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:16.280]  I mean, it's got everything. The rebound is off the charts awesome,
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.200]  and so is the pollen burst. I am choosing a pollen burst right now.
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:25.800]  You know, coffee, a little bit of it's good for you, but a lot of it's very bad for you,
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:33.560]  the oils and things in it. No more. You take a pollen burst or a rebound with things like ginseng
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:38.040]  and the rebound or a little bit of caffeine and all the B vitamins and the pollen burst.
[02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:42.040]  And I tell you, it's not like drinking that afternoon coffee that kind of wakes you up,
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:49.160]  it gives you a headache. I'm just woken up without the headache part. And I've lost 35 to 37 pounds,
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:55.960]  depending on which scale I look at. And the problem is I've got to make myself eat now.
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:01.240]  I mean, the Tangy Tangerine doesn't even have ginseng or caffeine in it. And that's my breakfast
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.880]  is a scoop of that in the morning. I mean, because my body didn't have the minerals and vitamins.
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:12.280]  So anyways, infoarsteam.com, infoarsteam.com or banners at infoars.com that lead over there for
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:17.160]  the Tangy Tangerine. You can become a member and get discounts on the products or you can

[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.360]  it's more powerful and focused than the radio show because I'm on a deadline with that show.
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:44.840]  It's more produced. 15 cents a day, 15 day free trial right now or you can get the yearly

[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:02.120]  We're certainly having a big effect. Cancer Beater from California. Gee, I wonder what
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:06.760]  your call's about. Welcome. Hi Alex, how you doing today?
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:09.640]  Oh, I'm ranting like a madman, mad for liberty. Go ahead.
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:16.760]  Oh, I'm loving your ranting, Alex. You were always awesome on the ranting. I had stage
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:22.360]  four colon cancer about a year and a half ago. And the doctors told me I only had six months
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.920]  to a year left to live without their treatment, maybe two to three years to live with their
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:32.840]  treatment, which meant they were never going to be able to cure me. And some friends of mine on
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:39.400]  Facebook told me to watch this documentary called The Beautiful Truth. And I bought the Gerson
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:45.480]  therapy book and a juicer from Costco, and also did run from the cure from Rick Stimson,
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:52.600]  which is basically hash oil. And I was able to cure myself in four months.
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:58.120]  Well, they're doing everything they can to keep you from getting that hash oil, I know.
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:04.040]  And yes, a lot of cancers, it's been proven with just the diet, cutting out the things that grow
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:10.440]  cancer, the alkalinity of the water, the system knows that. And now they admit
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:16.280]  that actually in most cases, chemotherapy kills you. It's just if your body can beat both,
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:23.000]  well then that's basically what happens. And colon cancer and other cancers of the gut is
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  like getting the flu now. In the last two years, three people in my office, their girlfriends or
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.120]  family members, young people have gotten colon cancer. And then start the radiation and all
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:40.760]  the rest of it, and of course, it never really helps them. And yeah, it's just cancer everywhere.
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:44.760]  50 years ago, scientists would travel the world over to see a child with cancer.
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.120]  Now I go to the mall, it's just kids with cancer everywhere. And because I mean,
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:53.320]  the New World Order is hitting us hard and loving it all the way to the bank. You pay for it,
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:57.240]  you pay to murder your children with all of it. And now if you try to get away from their
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:42:59.880]  chemotherapy with your kids, they just come and take them and murder them.
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:06.120]  And it's just all part of the murder enjoyment. And again, they've just tested the soft killing
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:11.320]  of us. And so now it's just gonna get more and more wild, more and more crazy. No, like never
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:15.560]  ask why do we have the highest breast cancer in the world and it's exploding. Never find out it's
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:21.800]  Bisphenol A and the GMO from the same rat studies. Just talk about figuring out how to cure it once
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:27.560]  you get it. Don't ask why everybody's getting it, because the little murderers, the same ones
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:30.520]  that are making the money off the treatments are the ones that gave it to you.
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:35.080]  They're sickening eugenicist murderers who promise to put stuff in your water like the
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:39.880]  White House science are said, and they think it's real cute. And they think it's real funny
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:43.480]  that they're killing everybody out in the open and nobody wants to stand up against them.
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:49.000]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:57.560]  Yeah, I also bought a atmospheric water generator so I can get myself off of the regular water supply.
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:02.920]  And basically you just plug it in the wall, it sucks water into it and produces high alkaline,
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:06.200]  high pH water to also battle cancer.
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:10.840]  Cancer beater, why don't you just trust the government and drink the tap water?
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:16.920]  We do have the highest rates of cancer, they must, they care. Are you an extremist? Because
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:22.120]  the other White House and Soros people, I have the article, are calling for shutting down the
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:27.880]  websites of conspiracy theorists, people that don't trust known certified liars. They're saying,
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:32.280]  if you don't believe known certified liars, you should be arrested. What's wrong with that?
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:36.520]  Well, I don't trust them as far as you can throw them.
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:40.760]  Well, I mean, that's cuz you're extreme. I mean, you're actually thinking for yourself.
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:50.280]  But being serious, so what's happened to the out of control cell growth similar to our government
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:56.120]  since you started the juicing and things? Well, it's completely reversed. I went from a
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:01.720]  two-inch golf ball-sized tumor and two lymph nodes on each side of my abdominal area and a bunch of
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:07.640]  activity going out of my lungs to absolutely clean and clear of cancer in four months.
[02:45:07.640 --> 02:45:12.200]  And what are the doctors saying? Are they trying to have you arrested or something
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:17.960]  forced on treatment? Absolutely not, but neither one of the oncologists wanted to know what I did
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:22.680]  to cure my cancer, which, in my opinion, just goes to prove that an oncologist is nothing more
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:28.120]  than a drug-dealing poison pusher. Well, yeah, they get hundreds of thousands of dollars for
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:33.400]  somebody they treat. And you're talking about $3,000, $4,000 per can of raid.
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:39.960]  Most of the chemo is basically just rat poison or roach poison. I mean, that's why they've come
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:47.880]  out now with a $3,000 a bottle hemp variant that is used to treat a bunch of illnesses.
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:53.560]  That was in the news yesterday. In fact, guys put, it was AP company comes out with synthetic
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:46:01.560]  marijuana. And they've got a $250 bottle of fish oil that should cost $10 that's synthetic
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:05.640]  and that they make money off of. And so, of course, they're trying to make it illegal
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:11.240]  for you to get fish oil for $10, so you have to buy it from them and go to a doctor.
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.920]  And I've seen articles where they swat team people now growing aloe vera saying it could be used as
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:21.800]  a drug. Look, you're not gonna get aloe vera, you're not gonna get fish, that's terrorism.
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:27.320]  I mean, you gotta use heroin shipped in by the US Army. I appreciate your call, terrorist.
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:31.880]  Joseph in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:36.120]  Hey, Alex, how are you? I'm pretty evil right now.
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:43.880]  Yeah, I can tell, man. I guess I have a question and I've got a comment. Well, I guess my comment's
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:49.320]  pretty big. I wanted to say that, I mean, all this stuff that you're saying about the doctors with
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:57.080]  Big Pharma supposedly taking care of everybody, it's heavy down here. I mean, flu shots for free
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:02.520]  in some cases down at Walmart or at Walgreens. Yeah, that's cuz they care about you. Joseph,
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:10.840]  Joseph, they care about you. They care about us so much that they got my mom and dad,
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:19.400]  they got their drawers filled with drugs. They've taken my sister's gallbladder out because we've
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:27.160]  got stones cuz she's sick from everything she's eating. And I've got aunts who are paralyzed from
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:30.680]  diseases that have sprung out of nowhere and it's all because my family's ecstatic.
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:40.440]  I mean, I almost caught cancer in my colon and I thankfully had it removed. It was a cancerous
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:45.240]  policy they found inside me. Yeah, well, let me expand on that. I should do a report on that.
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:52.760]  Blacks and Hispanics especially are all being targeted and the diabetes, the cancer rates,
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:56.840]  all of it is off the charts. And they've done studies I've seen where the behavior isn't
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:03.240]  different, but they're getting more HIV, more hepatitis. And yes, the globalist,
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:07.240]  there's no doubt are targeting people worldwide according to their race.
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:13.160]  And you're absolutely right. It's no joke. I mean, you said it, my parents have diabetes.
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:17.720]  They've got other complications due to it. They're both obese. I mean,
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:23.400]  and that's just my parents and it's running through my family. And they've got all sorts
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:27.000]  of people that are addicted to smoking cigarettes or addicted to drinking.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.080]  And by the way, what do they do with cigarettes? They put chemicals in them to make them more
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:35.640]  addicting and make you smoke more. They're doing it with the GMO. They're doing it with all the
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:41.240]  additives. They're doing it, they're killing us. People ate even more calories than they do now
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:46.200]  50 years ago on average. It's that the stuff we're eating is killing us. I appreciate your call.
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:51.560]  God bless you. Sorry to hear that's happened to your family. Get them on the tangy tangerine.
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:57.160]  Get them off the cigarettes. Get them to commit to not kill themselves. Get them off the GMO.
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:02.920]  Get them off the trans fats. What's killing us is stuff that isn't natural. I know that's extreme
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:06.920]  and I'm bad, but it's true. Here's a clip from Time Bandits I was mentioning earlier.
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:12.920]  Robert, just one. Your time has come.
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:18.840]  Oh, wonderful, wonderful. Wonderful. Don't mention it.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:31.560]  Benson,
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:45.560]  I'm a reasonable man. Give me the map and you might at least walk out of here on human feet.
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:55.400]  Oh,
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:09.400]  no.
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:13.240]  No.
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:18.120]  All right, there's from Time Bandits. Here's the head of Homeland Security
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:23.960]  who has decided to put everybody to the naked body scanner. I mean, think about it. They have
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:29.960]  TV shows in the US, every major anti-terror show where they torture somebody's kid to get the
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:33.640]  answers and it's always the right thing to do it. And in the real world in Abu Ghraib, they're
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:39.960]  torturing kids sexually. It comes out and no one gets in trouble who gave the orders. I mean,
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:45.960]  again, that's practicing evil openly. I want to go to Patrick and Doug at least. They've been holding
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:50.280]  the longest. I guess I'll do a little bit of overdraft to get to everybody, but I got to get
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:54.360]  into all the siren news. I haven't even gotten into the Tepco news. I haven't gotten into the
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:59.800]  Davos news. I haven't gotten into quite a bit of it, but I did cover a lot today. We'll be right back.

[02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:15.720]  Soon what to do is see him again, come on. But I can't leave it with him or he'll destroy the world.
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:23.000]  Oh, Robert Benson, I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins,
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:29.080]  filling every corner of my being with the desire to do wrong. I feel so bad, Benson.
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:35.560]  Good, good. Yes, it is good. Well, this is the worst kind of badness that I'm feeling.
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:38.360]  Kill me, monster, kill me. Not now, Benson, we have work to do.
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:46.520]  No lesser work than the overthrowing of creation itself. We will remake man in our image, not his.
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:54.920]  We will turn mountains into sea, and the skies into rivers, and the fjords into deserts.
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:05.400]  All right, that's enough. What an excellent movie. And that's what the globalists are doing.
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:09.800]  The devil wants to genetically engineer, screw everything up, murder people,
[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:15.160]  engage in diseased activity. And that's what psychopaths and control freaks actually want.
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:19.320]  That's what people don't get. They're like, why does the new order want this?
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:26.920]  Well, why does a rattlesnake wanna bite you? It's the old story of the scorpion. He asked
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:33.800]  the frog to take him across the river. The frog says, you'll sting me. And he says, no,
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:36.680]  I won't, I promise, just take me across. So the frog's nice, he takes him across.
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:40.840]  And when they get to the other side, the scorpion stings him and he's laying there dying. He says,
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:45.320]  but I took you across, why'd you sting me? And he said, because I'm a scorpion, silly.
[02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:49.880]  The Africans have, every culture's got it. They've got one with the cobra,
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:55.400]  where the cobra is hurt and ask the old man to carry him out of the desert. And when he gets the
[02:55:55.400 --> 02:55:59.240]  cobra out of the desert and just some water and everything, the cobra bites him and kills him.
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:02.440]  And as the old man's dying, he says, why'd you bite me? And he goes, I'm a cobra.
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.200]  I mean, the founding fathers explained from history, if you let this happen,
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:11.800]  you will be enslaved. And the level of enslavement you live under is the
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:18.360]  exact level you put up with. Thomas Jefferson said that, quote, I just gave you.
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.320]  And they said, in the letters back and forth between him and John Adams,
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:31.960]  he said, why? And he said, because it's a tropism. That's what it does.
[02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:40.920]  That's its nature. The worst of the worst will get in control. And then they'll only be topped
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:47.800]  by people worse, and then topped by people worse. So you always then sink to the bottom.
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:53.560]  And I don't know how much I can explain this to people. It is a absolute certainty
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:59.480]  that when I went, this was already going on, but for me, when I went and saw the military
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:03.320]  training to go door to door in the US and take our guns, it's all in Police State 2000.
[02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:11.080]  When I went and saw that, and then said, well, I better check our other drills.
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:15.480]  Hopefully, it's not happening in other drills. And I went to all these other drills and confirmed
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:19.880]  and saw them working with Boy Scouts to spy on their parents in the drills.
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:26.200]  I came back and started freaking out. And even though I had video of the Boy Scouts,
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:30.200]  people thought it was fake. Now today, I can show you the New York Times going,
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:33.960]  look at our Explorer Scouts training to kill disgruntled veterans.
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:42.760]  And they say it with a straight face. Can somebody say, danger, danger, danger, Will Robinson.
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:52.040]  I mean, 100%, the people running the government, it's a lot bigger than Bill Clinton, Obama, Bush.
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:57.960]  The special interest running things have a horrible destiny for this country. They're
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:02.920]  taking us in a bad place. And we're all kind of tied up in the car with a serial killer.
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:07.000]  And I'm trying to get out of the bonds. I'm saying, hey, you're not tied down as hard,
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  kind of help me get out there. Like, he'll hurt us if we resist. I'm like, listen,
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:14.680]  he's taken us to some shack someplace to torture the daylights out of us.
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:22.040]  Our only chance is to get out of here. You see, that's the thing. You're not gonna get out of this,
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:28.200]  kissing up to this thing. I know a lot of you are scared out there and you think, well,
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:32.840]  what can you do? You can do a lot. I mean, you know, get aggressive, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:46.280]  in the info war. What if our millions of listeners all did an info wars.com banner hang today?
[02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:48.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.760 --> 02:58:56.840]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.840 --> 02:58:59.960]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:04.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:10.200]  at home. I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:16.440]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:16.440 --> 02:59:21.880]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[02:59:21.880 --> 02:59:26.520]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes, constructing world government.
[02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:30.680]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the
[02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:35.000]  Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to today? It seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:41.640]  And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of
[02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:48.600]  the Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watching online right now in super high quality at

[03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:10.280]  Understanding of what, master? Digital watches. And soon I shall have understanding of video
[03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:14.040]  cassette recorders and car telephones. And when I have understanding of them,
[03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:17.880]  I shall have understanding of computers. And when I have understanding of computers,
[03:00:17.880 --> 03:00:24.680]  I shall be the supreme being. God isn't interested in technology. He knows nothing of the
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:29.800]  potential of the microchip or the Silicon revolution. Look how he spends his time. 43
[03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:39.960]  species of parents, nipples from their slugs, slugs created slugs. They got here. They got
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:48.120]  speak. They got operate machinery. I mean, are we not in the hands of a lunatic? Why
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:51.640]  we're creating a world I wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils.
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:01:00.360]  I would've started with lasers. Eight o'clock day one. Sorry. I just can't wait for the new
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:09.720]  tech technological dawn. That's enough. That's such a good movie.
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:15.480]  Oh, Terry Gilliam's a genius. Patrick in Illinois, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:17.080]  Hello. Hey.
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:22.600]  Hi, Alex. I'm glad you were talking about people getting angry and doing something.
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:28.040]  I like, I like Mark Dice's model of calling into different radio stations. And a frequent one I
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:33.720]  call is a guy named Norman Goldman. You like that establishment liberal kind of rag. And as soon as
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:38.440]  you mentioned Ron Paul, or you mentioned any real issues or that Obama's bought off by wall street,
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:44.040]  they'll just cut you right off. But I think it's a good thing to do, you know, call into liberal or
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:49.720]  any, anybody radio shows and try and get something about the NDA or that both parties are bought off.
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:56.040]  And, uh, yeah. And just really keep hammering them like with, with the phone mobs and you
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:00.920]  may have to use a pseudonym every once in a while, but it's a, I think it's a good way to get some
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:06.360]  information out there. Absolutely. I mean, we're talking about all this tyranny, plugging websites,
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:11.000]  calling a talk radio, doing your own local show, getting your own access TV show, using every
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:15.880]  medium we can to warn people because folks, when they hear the truth, now jump on it.
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:21.720]  People are hungry for this information, telling people about radio shows that are telling the
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:27.880]  truth, getting the buzz going for Ron Paul, even more, uh, making copies of DVD films. God bless
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:35.400]  you. Good to hear from you. Keep it up, Doug. Uh, or Doug is the next caller. Doug in Illinois,
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:40.440]  go ahead. Hello, Alex. Hey buddy. Hey, how's it going? You're looking good.
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:48.920]  First time caller. I got to tell you, I am awake now. Um, I'm a subscriber to the prison planet.
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:55.240]  I've got, uh, your stickers on my truck and for quite some time, I guess you could say it was
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:03:02.680]  half asleep and maybe I kept hitting the snooze button, but I'm fully awake now and I'm trying
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:09.160]  to wage the info war here in west central Illinois. Well, we just had another call from
[03:03:09.160 --> 03:03:13.160]  Illinois. So there's a lot of folks that get a lot of calls, a lot of support from Illinois.
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:17.320]  People certainly are waking up there because they're living under such a nasty form of
[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:24.600]  bureaucratic tyranny. Yeah. Yeah. Crooked, crooked, uh, tyranny. Uh, I got to tell you
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:30.760]  something that I've been doing is, uh, on my library phone, what I'll do is from your website,
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:37.640]  uh, pretty much daily, I'll pick one or two articles and cut or copy and paste them to a
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:43.480]  media message and send them out to the contacts in my phone attached with, uh,
[03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:47.960]  you know, an appropriate picture or whatever. Well, see, victory is so easy.
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:54.600]  Pick the media that you think is the most effective and then hit your email list, your
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:00.520]  Facebook, your Twitter, your, your phone contacts. Exactly. Just communicate with people that were
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:05.480]  there's already so many of us that are awake and then other people are wondering what's going on.
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:09.560]  This will really hurt the globalist. That's why they're moving to start curtailing the
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:13.800]  web right now because they know it's a chink in their potbellied armor. Go ahead.
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:19.720]  Uh, no, you're exactly right. And, uh, well, I'll usually end my little, uh, you know,
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:25.720]  media text message there with the article and I'll urge them to forward to everybody they know,
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:30.760]  or friends and family. And, uh, I've gotten a couple, you know, negative responses back, you
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:38.440]  know, uh, dropped the individuals from my forward list. The way to do it is just say, what do you
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:42.840]  think of this? I mean, it doesn't even have to be, you're pushing it on them. Like, what do you
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:47.320]  think of this? That's always a good way to, to, uh, you know, try to reach out to the people that
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:51.640]  are in zombie land. Great job. Sorry to Brad, Matthew and Merrill. If you call back tomorrow,
[03:04:51.640 --> 03:04:56.040]  I'll get to you first. Just tell, remind John there on the phone system and I'll
[03:04:56.040 --> 03:05:21.640]  see you back tonight. Seven o'clock central at info wars, news.com.
