[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.160 --> 00:47.680]  Well, my friends, it's another global transmission against tyranny. Every day is a blessing.
[00:47.680 --> 00:53.120]  We live on a beautiful planet full of wonderful people. There are so many just dynamic and
[00:53.120 --> 01:00.440]  invigorating things going on. We live on a world full of good and opportunity. And evil
[01:00.440 --> 01:07.360]  and corrupt individuals understand that, and they seek to dominate and control societies.
[01:07.360 --> 01:12.280]  Stuart Rhodes is gonna be joining us in the third hour today, constitutional lawyer, to
[01:12.280 --> 01:24.240]  break down the NDAA and the transference constitutionally into this modern despotic state and the fact
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.160]  that this is all illegitimate and illegal.
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.520]  You can't legalize tyranny. I've explained this many times, but he'll be joining us.
[01:33.520 --> 01:39.280]  We'll also look at the phenomenal situation. I mean, Ron Paul, they gave him like 8% in
[01:39.280 --> 01:45.040]  New Hampshire last time, four years ago. They engaged in massive fraud on every front. And
[01:45.040 --> 01:49.600]  there's some evidence of that. We're working on getting Bev Harris on today or tomorrow.
[01:49.600 --> 01:57.560]  But still, a very strong second with the controlled corporate zombie signal media, the zombie
[01:57.560 --> 02:03.080]  control, trans control, enemy control media, and that's what it is. I mean, it's not media.
[02:03.080 --> 02:09.960]  It's not their biased, their globalist fronts to create a false spectrum, a projection of
[02:09.960 --> 02:16.400]  false reality that they then trick you to debate within the controlled spectrum of false
[02:16.400 --> 02:24.160]  information and lying by omission and twisting and spinning and outright obfuscation of the
[02:24.160 --> 02:33.240]  truth and lying and a lecherous, larcenous, Luciferian gibber.
[02:33.240 --> 02:38.240]  Now we're going again to be here for the next three hours. We're gonna go over all of this.
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.940]  And every day I see footage like this and I most of the time mention it but never get
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.740]  to it. And if you're a radio listener, you go up to info wars.com. You can watch the
[02:47.740 --> 02:56.880]  footage. It's also at drudgereport.com, but bus confrontation caught on video in Bellflower.
[02:56.880 --> 03:03.000]  And the LA County sheriff's deputies get on board. There is a polite woman who the passengers
[03:03.000 --> 03:12.000]  say got on who has apparently special needs. And the woman says, aren't you a big shot
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  to the cops? So he coal cocks the old, what appears to be mentally retarded woman, knock
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.340]  her to the ground and then goes after the guy videotaping.
[03:22.340 --> 03:27.200]  You are here to pay taxes and take cancer filled shots and drink fluoride water and
[03:27.200 --> 03:33.680]  watch television to be programmed. The guy's like, give me your ID. I'm gonna run you your
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.840]  background cuz he's black. He's like, well, I'm a veteran of six tours. I'm just back.
[03:39.840 --> 03:45.760]  I promise. Yeah, we'll see about that slave. And of course, it turned out the guys who
[03:45.760 --> 03:47.720]  he said he was, but what if you weren't a veteran?
[03:47.720 --> 03:52.040]  Do I have my First Amendment if I'm not a veteran? By the way, they have a big study
[03:52.040 --> 03:56.040]  out with high schoolers. Most of them believe there's no First Amendment. And I guess they
[03:56.040 --> 04:02.200]  just love the idea of arresting everyone for their speech. So just giant masses of dumbed
[04:02.200 --> 04:10.440]  down idiots with police who were drawn from that very same pool just ready to roundhouse
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.160]  full power punch a woman cuz he's like, aren't you a big shot?
[04:14.160 --> 04:18.760]  You're like, you're not gonna put my ego down, lady. I'm gonna show you I got the power.
[04:18.760 --> 04:25.720]  I mean, if some poor homeless person says, aren't you a big shot? Even if I was tired,
[04:25.720 --> 04:31.820]  had a headache, whatever it was, I have too much pride in myself to full power punch somebody
[04:31.820 --> 04:36.400]  in the face and then run around and try to take somebody's camera away.
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.580]  But again, you gotta ask what type of people are like, this is a really proud of yourself.
[04:41.580 --> 04:48.760]  You punched a bag lady. Man, let me tell you, you're ready for the UFC now, aren't you?
[04:48.760 --> 04:54.960]  I tell you, I always grew up thinking someday I'll be a real man. I can full power punch
[04:54.960 --> 05:01.200]  a bag lady in the face and knock her down. I'll show her.
[05:01.200 --> 05:08.120]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[05:08.120 --> 05:13.080]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[05:13.080 --> 05:22.160]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset cheese. They soak
[05:22.160 --> 05:31.400]  right in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[05:31.400 --> 05:39.840]  in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gusset's got it, others don't.
[05:39.840 --> 05:46.620]  We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[05:46.620 --> 05:51.160]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[05:51.160 --> 05:58.400]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it,
[05:58.400 --> 06:02.320]  others don't. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[06:02.320 --> 06:07.060]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could
[06:07.060 --> 06:11.560]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to
[06:11.560 --> 06:16.420]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government
[06:16.420 --> 06:21.480]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[06:21.480 --> 06:26.280]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[06:26.280 --> 06:31.040]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[06:31.040 --> 06:35.080]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:35.080 --> 06:40.040]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[06:40.040 --> 06:43.920]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions
[06:43.920 --> 06:50.480]  from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[06:50.480 --> 06:56.240]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun. So go to mysolarbackup.com
[06:56.240 --> 07:03.360]  or call 1-877-327-0365. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking
[07:03.360 --> 07:08.940]  for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means
[07:08.940 --> 07:13.540]  to make money. The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give
[07:13.540 --> 07:17.980]  you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what
[07:17.980 --> 07:24.240]  you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[07:24.240 --> 07:30.080]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[07:30.080 --> 07:35.560]  that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want something
[07:35.560 --> 07:38.960]  better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've
[07:38.960 --> 07:45.740]  never done before. Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin

[08:16.000 --> 08:30.320]  the web at 5starsoap.com. All right, we've got some really big breaking news obviously
[08:30.320 --> 08:40.080]  here today. I told you back in October and then in November that war was already taking
[08:40.080 --> 08:48.760]  place in Iran. And now if you just type in war is already taking place in Iran, you will
[08:48.760 --> 08:55.080]  see hundreds of newspapers and publications just now telling the population this.
[08:55.080 --> 09:01.560]  Kind of like the New York Times two weeks ago and again yesterday came out and reported,
[09:01.560 --> 09:09.140]  the government in Fast and Furious is also laundering millions in drug money. No, it's
[09:09.140 --> 09:14.840]  not millions, it's hundreds of billions. Now again, I'm not tooting our horn. This is all
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.480]  in federal court. The government admits to this, the so-called government. But Stuart
[09:20.480 --> 09:27.440]  Rhodes, constitutional law scholar, former top Ron Paul staffer will be joining us in
[09:27.440 --> 09:32.760]  the third hour today because he can break down the NDAA and a full spectrum tyranny
[09:32.760 --> 09:35.560]  and the fact that it's illegitimate.
[09:35.560 --> 09:39.840]  I shot a video last week that's still a featured video on our YouTube channel. Unfortunately
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.680]  only has 250,000 views or something. It should have about 5 million, but whatever. I can
[09:44.680 --> 09:49.360]  make a joke video and it gets 3 million views, but serious stuff doesn't. I shouldn't complain.
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.920]  The point is, is that we break down the fact you can't legalize tyranny. And the NDAA is
[09:55.920 --> 10:01.240]  a hoax. And I'm gonna explain this again. They had laws that black people weren't humans
[10:01.240 --> 10:06.960]  in this country. And it took people, mainly white Christians, saying, you know what, I
[10:06.960 --> 10:08.920]  don't care if you say that's the law.
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.520]  And I don't care if you hang me for it. I'm going to go help break people off of the property
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.480]  that you say is property, but break them off of the plantation property. And I'm gonna
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.220]  try to get them to safe places. And then after a while, a lot of folks said, you know what,
[10:25.220 --> 10:29.880]  you're gonna try to kill me. I'll just start carrying guns and shooting back.
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.600]  You know what, you can't legalize tyranny. And it's real simple. I mean, Hitler was the
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.760]  law. And so did you just have to, when they came to get you and your wife and kids and
[10:38.760 --> 10:43.760]  take you away because of what race you were, what political persuasion. Did you just go
[10:43.760 --> 10:46.760]  with them? Yeah, most people said you're the law.
[10:46.760 --> 10:50.800]  And the German soldiers and others at Nuremberg said, well, we were following orders. And
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.800]  some of the prosecutors at Nuremberg said, well, let's let them go. And they said, no,
[10:54.800 --> 11:01.560]  we can't do that. But nowadays, every time I see Amish being arrested for producing their
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.760]  own milk, or people selling eggs or whatever on the side of the street, they say, I'm just
[11:06.760 --> 11:07.800]  doing my job.
[11:07.800 --> 11:13.200]  Now what you're doing is helping destroy this country. And now you see the wages of the
[11:13.200 --> 11:20.520]  New World Order. You see that globalism is a curse. You see that it's like the plague.
[11:20.520 --> 11:27.480]  It's not rosy and cute and trendy and what the intellectuals are for. One world is not
[11:27.480 --> 11:34.120]  one world of peace and liberty. It's one world under despotic corporate rule with technocratic
[11:34.120 --> 11:40.340]  autocrats that sit back in their oligarchy and punch buttons and never even look at what
[11:40.340 --> 11:42.300]  they're doing to people.
[11:42.300 --> 11:47.260]  And who have a cosmology and a philosophy of hating their fellow humans and seeing us
[11:47.260 --> 11:55.560]  as a disease to be eradicated modern transhumanist eugenics. And mark my words, it's all written
[11:55.560 --> 12:03.000]  on the wall. It's all public. The only question is, do you have the will to admit the truth?
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.320]  Because if you look at the facts and admit the truth, there is no choice, you will join
[12:09.320 --> 12:10.320]  liberty.
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.760]  There is no choice because the New World Order isn't inviting you to join them midterm, not
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.440]  long term. You don't have to wait long term now for the stuff to come down, midterm and
[12:19.440 --> 12:24.560]  short term. You're going to be squeezed. You're going to be run over. You're going to be enslaved.
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.600]  You're going to be humiliated. You're going to die an early death from all the binary
[12:29.600 --> 12:33.680]  weapons and other systems they've put into us.
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.880]  If you don't know what that is, you better look it up. Because this is about entertainment.
[12:38.880 --> 12:43.160]  It's not about jokes, not about games, not about being a big radio host, it's not all
[12:43.160 --> 12:47.880]  about that garbage. This is about the real world, ladies and gentlemen, and facing it
[12:47.880 --> 13:01.600]  head on. It's the only way to stop it. Now, what's amazing is that in the last five years,
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.720]  there have been hundreds of assassinations and thousands of killings.
[13:06.720 --> 13:12.200]  Because in some cases they blow up whole buildings full of people, blow up whole military bases.
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.480]  And Iran doesn't like to look weak. So they're always saying, that bridge just blew up when
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.280]  Ahmadinejad drove across there. This command military base or this internal police base
[13:21.280 --> 13:26.560]  headquarters just blew up. There's a crater at a 15 story building. Nothing's there. The
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.380]  building's blown all over the city as a gas main.
[13:32.380 --> 13:38.360]  So Iran won't say it's the US and Israel and England. And our own government won't. You
[13:38.360 --> 13:45.140]  remember last year Stuxnet was launched. And I said, you watch the NORTHCOM and the Cyber
[13:45.140 --> 13:49.320]  Command that's already in place, even though they haven't passed the law, they don't care.
[13:49.320 --> 13:55.640]  Laws, they've occupied this country. See, our military people are Americans and love
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.120]  America, but they're under mind control just like everybody else.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.480]  They don't understand the commanders, the leadership, the system above them, they work
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.280]  for the New World Order. But because they're wearing an American flag on their arm, notice
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.160]  you see more and more American flags everywhere. Like people trying to say, I'm in with the
[14:11.160 --> 14:15.600]  police state, I'm in with the system, I go along with the war.
[14:15.600 --> 14:21.160]  That's what it symbolizes now. But most of the people I've talked to have American flags
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.600]  all over their cars. It's like, why do you gotta stick it everywhere? Cuz you know deep
[14:24.600 --> 14:35.040]  down it's gone. It's gone like the year 1957 and it ain't coming back. America is gone.
[14:35.040 --> 14:41.520]  ManCal this morning I was on a show, he said, Alex, is the US government, is America giving
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.000]  Latin American leaders cancer? And I said, buddy, America doesn't exist anymore. It can
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.500]  always be resurrected like the Phoenix.
[14:49.500 --> 14:54.080]  You can always bring it back cuz it's an idea. Liberty, freedom, Bill of Rights, Constitution,
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.960]  Declaration of Independence, but it's basically gone. And so of course you can't ever get
[14:58.960 --> 15:05.920]  it back because people won't admit how far gone it is. Like children, the corporate whore
[15:05.920 --> 15:11.160]  media talk to the public like lobotomized sheep.
[15:11.160 --> 15:14.440]  That's how they see us with their little Fox News Christmas cards to each other is us as
[15:14.440 --> 15:22.520]  sheep bullying them. I don't wanna analyze that more later today in detail cuz I didn't
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.440]  even properly analyze it. I've looked at those Christmas cards more carefully now. And Fox
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.380]  News put this out publicly. They sent it to their competitors and they published it.
[15:32.380 --> 15:40.440]  And it's sheep in a sled race. And Fox News is ahead of CBS News, ABC News, and NBC News
[15:40.440 --> 15:45.280]  saying they're now competing with the networks. And they're sheep pulling them and then looking
[15:45.280 --> 15:52.240]  over the hilltop as spectators are MSNBC and CNN saying you're not even in the sleigh race.
[15:52.240 --> 16:00.600]  You know why? Because in the image they have no sheep. And you notice they aren't really
[16:00.600 --> 16:07.480]  foxes in the image. They're like big foxes. They're more like wolves, giant wolves. Now
[16:07.480 --> 16:08.480]  there's the image.
[16:08.480 --> 16:16.480]  They're telling you everything in that image. Because again, criminals and scum and chicken
[16:16.480 --> 16:23.840]  neck control freaks revel in lying to people. Like you see someone being conned or mistreated,
[16:23.840 --> 16:27.660]  you instinctively don't like it because you feel a brotherhood of humanity. Sociopaths
[16:27.660 --> 16:34.640]  and their psycho controllers, the psychos set atop them, they revel in seeing goodness
[16:34.640 --> 16:35.640]  pulled down.
[16:35.640 --> 16:40.520]  It's a very secure feeling. You like cookies and milk by the fire. They like little kids
[16:40.520 --> 16:44.740]  chained down with electric drills going in them. I mean, they're a different breed of
[16:44.740 --> 16:50.560]  people we face. And until you realize that, and they're trying to turn our psychic atmosphere
[16:50.560 --> 16:54.520]  into their atmosphere with all the shows about how torture's cool and go ahead and torture
[16:54.520 --> 16:55.980]  people's kids, it's cool.
[16:55.980 --> 17:02.680]  This is pure evil. And I said, you watch, they're gonna launch the stuff that's been
[17:02.680 --> 17:08.360]  launched, this industrial hacking system that has to be injected directly into the computer
[17:08.360 --> 17:11.900]  systems that aren't networked. But they'll still use that, even though it's a different
[17:11.900 --> 17:15.720]  type of attack, to say we should censor the Internet and shut things down.
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.440]  And that somehow a foreign government put out Stuxnet like Russia, China. And sure enough,
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.200]  a month later, they came out and said, yeah, Stuxnet's a foreign power. We need to take
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.840]  your rights away on the Internet cuz of it. And it's admitted to the United States that
[17:29.840 --> 17:35.760]  Israel cooked the thing up.
[17:35.760 --> 17:44.120]  Now Iran, in the last month, has had top generals shot, top scientists car bombed, military
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.080]  bases blown up, and their giant, the whole base is a crater. And the news says, an ammo
[17:50.080 --> 17:55.520]  dump blew up, yeah. Right when Akhmed Nadezhdi was supposed to arrive, he arrived late. He
[17:55.520 --> 17:57.320]  knows how to move his schedule around.
[17:57.320 --> 18:01.860]  But the top missile general, he did die. Well, now there's another one. And the New York
[18:01.860 --> 18:07.800]  Times is making fun of people that say Israel is involved. I mean, folks, do people read
[18:07.800 --> 18:13.120]  these mainstream newspapers to feel like morons and to know you're being laughed at and talked
[18:13.120 --> 18:14.120]  down to?
[18:14.120 --> 18:21.280]  It's like that Dana Bash on the news saying, I'm worried about him ruining it for the other
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.280]  Republican person and so are other Republicans. What does that even mean? Ron Paul's gonna
[18:25.280 --> 18:31.400]  ruin Iowa. He's gonna ruin this. He's gonna ruin it for the Republican nominee. This talking
[18:31.400 --> 18:36.040]  point that he'll make Obama win on CNN.
[18:36.040 --> 18:42.360]  They just dispense with any fair objectivism because they're scared to death. They're running
[18:42.360 --> 18:50.500]  scared. My gosh, the sheep aren't acting like sheep anymore. So I told you, in the last
[18:50.500 --> 18:55.600]  four or five months, they've escalated, blowing stuff up almost every day. Now, if that isn't
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.520]  a war, I don't know what is.
[18:59.520 --> 19:02.920]  And here's an article by Paul Joseph Watson that just came out, US-backed terror group
[19:02.920 --> 19:08.080]  responsible for assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist, support for terrorist organization,
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.360]  part of covert war to topple Iran regime. And if you look at the four groups they got
[19:13.360 --> 19:18.320]  in there, there's five total, one's Kurdish, the others are all real, the hobbyist al-Qaeda.
[19:18.320 --> 19:25.600]  Just like in Libya, the stinking criminals that run our government, run al-Qaeda. They
[19:25.600 --> 19:29.600]  use them against us to take our liberty. They use them against the Serbs to take their liberty.
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.360]  They use them against the Russians. They use them against everybody. Al-Qaeda, the skeleton
[19:34.360 --> 19:40.160]  key, the arm of the New World Order, the sword Valkyrie held at the side of the black war
[19:40.160 --> 19:43.540]  chief Lucifer.
[19:43.540 --> 19:51.920]  The key that opens any door. And now, report Tehran car bomb kills Iranian nuclear scientist.
[19:51.920 --> 19:57.000]  So don't say the West is involved or you're a conspiracy theorist. In fact, if you can
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.040]  think you're a conspiracy theorist and it's a thought crime.

[21:32.000 --> 21:36.520]  ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've
[21:36.520 --> 21:41.160]  been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold
[21:41.160 --> 21:45.840]  for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

[22:00.780 --> 22:04.720]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid? Did you know that mercury from
[22:04.720 --> 22:08.720]  your dental fillings comes off of your teeth both as a vapor and as particles into your
[22:08.720 --> 22:13.020]  body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body it stops cells from functioning normally.
[22:13.020 --> 22:17.960]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited
[22:17.960 --> 22:22.160]  into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function. The number
[22:22.160 --> 22:26.960]  one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one
[22:26.960 --> 22:31.640]  super food that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione

[24:22.360 --> 24:32.680]  I see articles all the time in the news about conspiracy theorists say Israel has hundreds
[24:32.680 --> 24:39.640]  of nuclear weapons. No, Jane's Weapons Quarterly since the late 1960s says Israel has nuclear
[24:39.640 --> 24:44.560]  weapons. Every major government out there that has analysis says they've got at least
[24:44.560 --> 24:51.360]  300. And ICBMs to deliver them anywhere in the world and medium range missiles.
[24:51.360 --> 24:57.640]  But again, only Americans are talked to like we're children. And I've actually had people
[24:57.640 --> 25:03.000]  call into the show before and say, you shouldn't talk about Israel and its nukes. Number one,
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.440]  you're wrong, but number two, you shouldn't talk about it. And say, okay, okay, Russia
[25:07.440 --> 25:14.480]  launched the Stuxnet against Iran. Okay, some type of mythical creature is blowing up all
[25:14.480 --> 25:15.840]  these military bases.
[25:15.840 --> 25:21.800]  Okay, doesn't matter you've had all these Israeli scientists come out and break down
[25:21.800 --> 25:25.760]  that they've got, of course they've got it. And then it becomes the hypocritical discussion,
[25:25.760 --> 25:31.480]  why can they have it? Or why does Pakistan have over 100 nuclear weapons? I don't know
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.200]  if the so-called mainstream media said they didn't now, would I have to go, will you say
[25:36.200 --> 25:37.200]  so?
[25:37.200 --> 25:45.320]  I mean, if Barbara Walters or somebody said, walk off a cliff, you can fly. I'm like, I'll
[25:45.320 --> 25:50.960]  just jump off the Grand Canyon cuz you said so. I mean, they just would straight faces
[25:50.960 --> 26:00.260]  spew the most ridiculous bull at people. We're a laughing stock around the world. Americans,
[26:00.260 --> 26:06.040]  because of the brainwashing, compared to any other nation, cannot mention continents, systems
[26:06.040 --> 26:09.840]  of government, famous events.
[26:09.840 --> 26:17.360]  I mean, just don't have passports on average, know nothing. And think having pot-bellied
[26:17.360 --> 26:21.520]  known criminals stick their hands down your pants and grab your genitals, they think that's
[26:21.520 --> 26:29.040]  freedom. And then I get up here and say, there's a covert war going on in Iran, that's ridiculous,
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.920]  none of that's going on.
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.480]  And Bush five years ago signed the order to launch this stuff and Obama has expanded it.
[26:38.480 --> 26:43.560]  And a known al-Qaeda group that has been taken off the terrorist list now and is hanging
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.720]  out in DC and Anwar al-Awlaki was hanging out secretly with the head of the Pentagon.
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.040]  And I talked to these guys that just love to get rid of our rights cuz the Arabs have
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.200]  gotta die. And I tell them, you know most of the homeland security is focused on conservatives
[26:55.200 --> 26:56.200]  and libertarians.
[26:56.200 --> 27:00.880]  Now, you know that I can give you all these examples of al-Qaeda working for the US government.
[27:00.880 --> 27:04.880]  People like Tucker Carlson, when he was talking to Adam versus the man, Adam Kokesh, he said,
[27:04.880 --> 27:10.700]  you're parasites, Alex Jones is a bleeper, and you have no proof. How dare you say this
[27:10.700 --> 27:11.700]  with no proof?
[27:11.700 --> 27:14.560]  And it's like the proof's everywhere, but they just say you have no proof. I mean, it's
[27:14.560 --> 27:20.240]  like this trick of just, I say so. It's like, my gosh, you're an establishment person and
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.640]  your hair has come so nice and you're acting condescending, I better bow down to you right
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.640]  away.
[27:25.640 --> 27:34.640]  I mean, it's like a game, it's a trance, it's a joke. I mean, every form of classical tyranny
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.160]  is rearing up in our face. And we're here ringing the alarm bells and they're saying,
[27:39.160 --> 27:44.880]  anybody that says that we should follow the Constitution is crazy. Anybody that says if
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.840]  you don't follow the Constitution, you'll get into tyranny is crazy.
[27:48.840 --> 27:57.280]  It's all happening. I mean, look at this out of Herat's report, Tehran car bomb kills Iranian
[27:57.280 --> 28:05.400]  nuclear scientist. It goes on to say the government news agency reports that Ahmadi Roshan, 32,
[28:05.400 --> 28:12.720]  supervised development of the Natazin uranium enrichment facility. The Tehran official blames
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.000]  Israel for the bombing, so Iran's actually coming out and pointing out who's behind it,
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.980]  which before they wouldn't do cuz it made them look weak.
[28:19.980 --> 28:23.680]  But now it's too obvious with bombs going off constantly. But what does the New York
[28:23.680 --> 28:32.560]  Times say? They condescend. I'm sure that he did it to himself. Blaming US and Israel,
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.720]  all those nasty Iranians. They did it again, they said the sky was blue. Is there no shame?
[28:38.720 --> 28:46.360]  I mean, they expect us to believe Israel and the people that run the US, the globalist,
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.160]  would carry out covert operations that they admit they're doing.
[28:49.160 --> 28:53.420]  See, that's what's funny. Sheperately, cuz they have to authorize it. It's all authorized
[28:53.420 --> 29:01.320]  and admitted they're doing it. But then for the public, they say, how silly. I heard a
[29:01.320 --> 29:06.120]  funny one today, Martha. They said Israel was the one blowing up all those military
[29:06.120 --> 29:07.120]  bases.
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.960]  And I've seen some of the satellite photos of these bases. It's gotta be 2,000 pound
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.080]  bombs are dropping. I mean, some of these are aircraft up there doing this. This isn't
[29:15.080 --> 29:19.400]  just saboteurs, but it doesn't matter cuz a good old boy who thinks he's a good old
[29:19.400 --> 29:20.400]  boy.
[29:20.400 --> 29:22.920]  He didn't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line, but he knows how to wear a John
[29:22.920 --> 29:27.800]  Deere hat. He'll go, Martha, listen to this. The Iranians are saying our government would
[29:27.800 --> 29:32.440]  do that. Our government wouldn't do that. Everybody knows it's Iraners that blow stuff
[29:32.440 --> 29:37.320]  up them Arabs. Hey, buddy, they're not Arabs, they're Persians. Shut up, I wanna get my
[29:37.320 --> 29:38.320]  rights up.
[29:38.320 --> 29:43.160]  I hope the foreign banks take everything I got, cuz it's patriotic. All right, tons
[29:43.160 --> 29:50.120]  of news straight ahead. You don't wanna miss what's coming up. Stay with us.
[29:50.120 --> 30:02.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.320 --> 30:06.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[30:06.880 --> 30:09.240]  chance to not relive history.
[30:09.240 --> 30:13.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[30:13.560 --> 30:14.560]  at home.
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.600]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress. And they really are calling
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.600]  the shots.
[30:20.600 --> 30:25.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:25.520 --> 30:31.040]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.680]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[30:35.680 --> 30:40.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[30:40.080 --> 30:42.240]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[30:42.240 --> 30:48.080]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall
[30:48.080 --> 30:49.080]  of the Republic.

[33:18.560 --> 33:25.000]  So here's the headlines. Tehran car bomb kills Iranian nuclear scientist. Of course, they've
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.360]  got that Iranian former US Marine Corps guy who said he was visiting his grandma over
[33:32.360 --> 33:38.640]  there. People could say, well, why do they always assassinate people with bombs? Because
[33:38.640 --> 33:41.080]  that way, you make sure you get them.
[33:41.080 --> 33:45.920]  You can't insert somebody like Chris Kyle, a sniper, into the middle of a major Iranian
[33:45.920 --> 33:54.720]  city, a guy who can barely speak English from Texas, much less speak Farsi. And again, I've
[33:54.720 --> 33:58.400]  seen the satellite photos of some of these bases that have been blown up. It's not even
[33:58.400 --> 34:02.920]  saboteurs on the ground doing this. Very serious situation.
[34:02.920 --> 34:08.480]  Here's another one. Assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist is a familiar story. London
[34:08.480 --> 34:15.400]  Telegraph, the script by now is familiar enough. An assassin riding a motorcycle, that's the
[34:15.400 --> 34:23.720]  Mossad signature, weaves through Tehran, mourning traffic towards his target. Almost invariably,
[34:23.720 --> 34:31.880]  a car, the vehicle of choice for officials of Iran's nuclear program, cuz it's a pujo,
[34:31.880 --> 34:36.800]  you pronounce it, continuing.
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.920]  Leaning out of hand, the motorist attaches a magnetic explosive device, sometimes called
[34:41.920 --> 34:46.720]  a sticky bomb, to the door nearest the man he's trying to kill, and then speeds off.
[34:46.720 --> 34:53.640]  Seconds later, the bomb is detonated by remote control. It is so sophisticated that only
[34:53.640 --> 34:59.280]  the target is killed. Those sitting next to him are in front or behind him escape with
[34:59.280 --> 35:08.440]  just cuts and bruises, yeah, it's a shape charge. Wednesday's target was Mustafa Ahmadiyya
[35:08.440 --> 35:15.200]  Roshan, killed in his vehicle in front of a university campus in East Tehran.
[35:15.200 --> 35:21.640]  A chemist by training, he was a deputy director of Iran's main uranium enrichment plant. A
[35:21.640 --> 35:25.760]  role given to him because of his expertise in gas separation technology, a technique
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.760]  vital to the enrichment process. He was the fifth Iranian nuclear scientist to be targeted
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.800]  in the past two years, and the fourth to die.
[35:34.800 --> 35:42.840]  The only survivor was the biggest prize of all. In 2010, I'm not gonna even try to pronounce
[35:42.840 --> 35:50.520]  the name, now the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization was well trained enough to recognize
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.400]  that the clicking sound of the door of his car meant he and his wife leapt clear just
[35:55.400 --> 35:56.400]  in time.
[35:56.400 --> 36:01.440]  The same day on the other side of Iran's capital, one of his colleagues was less fortunate and
[36:01.440 --> 36:08.000]  fell victim to another motorcycle assassin. Iran's officials were quick to portion blame
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.800]  Wednesday, the latest attack directing angry accusations at both Israel and their intelligence
[36:14.800 --> 36:17.400]  service, the Mossad, and at the Americans.
[36:17.400 --> 36:20.880]  A lot of Western security experts will say the Iranians have some justification their
[36:20.880 --> 36:26.600]  suspicion, at least as far as Israel's concerned. Mossad is expert at carrying out assassinations
[36:26.600 --> 36:33.280]  abroad, and Israel has most to lose from Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. And boy, you better
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.800]  believe the folks carrying these out are risking their lives, trying to get into Iran and do
[36:37.800 --> 36:38.800]  that.
[36:38.800 --> 36:42.880]  The latest assassination comes at a particularly tense time in Iran's relations with the West.
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.080]  In the past fortnight, the United States and Europe have begun the process of implementing
[36:47.080 --> 36:53.920]  sanctions that could, for the first time, seriously threaten the Iranian regime's survival.
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.280]  Iran has responded by threatening to seal off the Strait of Hormuz, through which one
[36:57.280 --> 37:03.680]  fifth of the world's oil supplies passes, sentencing a US former Marine of Iranian descent
[37:03.680 --> 37:09.240]  to death on spying charges and holding war games in the Persian Gulf.
[37:09.240 --> 37:15.760]  This week, it announced that the uranium enrichment began at a second facility, Fordow, buried
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.880]  deep underground, making it much harder to use military force to destroy Iran's nuclear
[37:19.880 --> 37:20.880]  program.
[37:20.880 --> 37:28.480]  And the word I've got from multiple military sources high and low, including Colonel Schaffer,
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.160]  is that they do actually have atomic weapons, they probably do. They could have easily gotten
[37:33.160 --> 37:39.120]  them from Pakistan. I mean, South Africa had a bunch of nukes. Most countries have race-specific
[37:39.120 --> 37:41.040]  bioweapons.
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.860]  Can you imagine what happens when these accidentally get out or are released, or somebody gets
[37:45.860 --> 37:50.960]  mad cuz their husband or wife gets killed, and so they release a race-specific bioweapon?
[37:50.960 --> 37:55.660]  And you've got all these eugenicists at the major universities here in the West, writing
[37:55.660 --> 38:00.360]  public papers about how great it's gonna be when the airborne bird flu or Ebola gets released
[38:00.360 --> 38:03.680]  and how they're ready to die with their family, and how beautiful it is.
[38:03.680 --> 38:11.240]  I mean, whoa, I'm not worried about Iran. The West wants to attack Iran for political
[38:11.240 --> 38:18.680]  diversions while they implode the world economy. Israel is into six months of rioting and demonstrations
[38:18.680 --> 38:27.360]  across the board, across their political spectrum. Europe, the United States, everybody is angry.
[38:27.360 --> 38:31.720]  But if they get us into a big war, Americans will rally around the flag that's plastered
[38:31.720 --> 38:32.720]  on the war.
[38:32.720 --> 38:41.120]  The Israelis will do it, the Brits will do it, and this is gonna be a big war. And most
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.160]  military sources I've talked to in my own analysis is that Iran is gonna concentrate
[38:45.160 --> 38:51.680]  its attacks on Western targets in the Strait of Hormuz and Israel and other areas of the
[38:51.680 --> 38:53.560]  Middle East, Central Asia.
[38:53.560 --> 38:59.600]  That they probably won't attack the West, but the head of their intelligence unit for
[38:59.600 --> 39:07.920]  their parliament said they are gonna target Tel Aviv and New York and other cities, which
[39:07.920 --> 39:15.080]  is a terrible idea to talk about it especially. But if they do do it, that will, I mean, if
[39:15.080 --> 39:20.960]  a scratch is laid on an American, there will be news cameras weeping, wailing, freaking
[39:20.960 --> 39:21.960]  out.
[39:21.960 --> 39:26.660]  How dare them when we're bombing them, do something, nuke them. I mean, people will
[39:26.660 --> 39:32.440]  be trying to strap their children on missile cones, kill brown people. I wanna breathe
[39:32.440 --> 39:39.640]  radiation. I mean, it's tribal, it's fun to get into. It's fun to freak out and watch
[39:39.640 --> 39:44.360]  a car bomb go off and ninny and then bow to men in black uniforms standing around street
[39:44.360 --> 39:45.800]  corners with machine guns.
[39:45.800 --> 39:51.040]  It's fun to have your wife and children groped and humiliated for the average mind controlled
[39:51.040 --> 39:56.800]  sheeple. Who wants to vote for Mitt Romney who supports open borders, abortion, carbon
[39:56.800 --> 40:04.840]  taxes and wrote Obamacare. So I mean, there is a large contingent of sheeple who are hopelessly
[40:04.840 --> 40:08.960]  confused from birth and just are ready to do whatever they're told.
[40:08.960 --> 40:13.840]  And I see a bunch of Christian groups, mainly Christian Zionist groups going praise God
[40:13.840 --> 40:19.000]  that the world's about to begin nuclear Armageddon. And then I hear them accuse some of the Muslims
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.640]  for wanting that as well. And there are some groups over there that are just as crazy.
[40:23.640 --> 40:27.880]  And it's like you're saying they're bad cuz they think the end of the world's coming but
[40:27.880 --> 40:35.320]  you're saying new comes start, make Jesus come back. I mean, wow. And most of these
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.120]  people are incredibly soft. They've got their little office job.
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.880]  They go to the cafeteria for church on Sundays, they sit around. They have no idea what a
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.160]  real depression is gonna be like. They have no idea what potentially hundreds of thousands
[40:51.160 --> 40:55.520]  of body bags are gonna be like instead of just a few thousand. They have no idea what
[40:55.520 --> 40:58.040]  $10 a gallon gas is gonna be like.
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.520]  And they're all gonna be waiting, going, Jesus, come get me, come get me. Where's the golden
[41:02.520 --> 41:10.080]  ladder leading down? Where's Jacob's ladder? Where's Captain Kirk up there saying, beam
[41:10.080 --> 41:17.440]  them up. And it isn't gonna happen. And you're just gonna be there going beam me up, beam
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.880]  me up, beam me up. Christians have done it in the last 100 years in every country when
[41:21.880 --> 41:22.880]  they're being killed.
[41:22.880 --> 41:27.040]  They just roll over because the last 150 years they've taught this pre-tribulation rapture
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.640]  business. And whether that was true or not, the point is you've gotta fight evil. If you're
[41:31.640 --> 41:36.160]  a good person, you're gonna stand up against corruption, Christian or not. And these cop-outs
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.800]  and this stuff for the secular world, they'll make fun of Christians or Muslims or Jews
[41:40.800 --> 41:43.000]  all day or Hindus or Buddhists.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.080]  But I see all these secular atheists and kinda New Ager people, they're like, well, it is
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.280]  a new energy force. The Mayans who couldn't invent the wheel, they say it's the end of
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.280]  the world, which they really didn't say that, but whatever. So there's something to it.
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.120]  And look at all the craziness, because the New World Order has a timetable to start World
[42:02.120 --> 42:07.400]  War III in 2012. And they want you to sit back and go, there's nothing we can do. It
[42:07.400 --> 42:13.200]  is the end of the world. We must pray to the Lord. Yeah, you better pray to God to get
[42:13.200 --> 42:15.000]  you in gear.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.060]  I mean, you think you're on this planet, so if everything starts going crazy in haywire,
[42:21.060 --> 42:29.620]  you're just supposed to salute the so-called Christian leaders like Santorum and Obama.
[42:29.620 --> 42:36.140]  And just say, you keep us safe from the Muslim scourge as they sell it. I mean, Santorum's
[42:36.140 --> 42:42.880]  back out saying eradicate Muslims, basically. Yeah, I'm sure that they're gonna lay down
[42:42.880 --> 42:43.880]  for that.
[42:43.880 --> 42:51.640]  There's only a billion, 300 million of them. And most of them just want to live in a free
[42:51.640 --> 42:56.960]  market system, they're anti-communist. But let's turn them into anti-America, and then
[42:56.960 --> 43:00.600]  let's play us off against each other while the bankers sit there and come in and pick
[43:00.600 --> 43:02.880]  up the pieces, divide and conquer.
[43:02.880 --> 43:08.800]  See, I'm not a pit bull to be thrown in another ring with another pit bull. I'm not a rooster
[43:08.800 --> 43:11.880]  that you throw me in the ring, everybody's betting money. The bankers are betting money
[43:11.880 --> 43:15.480]  and I sit there with little razor blades on my feet. And I sit there and try to slice
[43:15.480 --> 43:20.160]  the other guy to death. You know what? I'm not a rooster, I'm not a pit bull. Yeah, I'm
[43:20.160 --> 43:22.240]  not getting in the ring for you, okay?
[43:22.240 --> 43:32.480]  I know who the real enemy is. I know who the ring master is. Yeah, you can, there's all
[43:32.480 --> 43:40.920]  sorts of aggressive forms of fish. And you can go buy them, and you can stick them in
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.920]  a fish tank together and watch them kill each other. That's just not my cup of tea. I'm
[43:44.920 --> 43:50.280]  not like the NFL guys or whatever that, when the dog doesn't win the fight, I electrocute
[43:50.280 --> 43:52.320]  them or whatever cuz I'm tough.
[43:52.320 --> 43:58.200]  Real men walk around with big pit bulls and everything. I'm not a real American, you gotta
[43:58.200 --> 44:01.960]  get down to that, you gotta understand that. I'm not for torturing kids, I'm not for endless
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.800]  war. I'm not for having the troops use depleted uranium and just beat their chest and go, we're
[44:05.800 --> 44:06.800]  tough, we can use it.
[44:06.800 --> 44:13.600]  I'm blood drying out their nose, I'm one of the kids deformed. I'm not here to be a chump.
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.560]  I'm not here to be an idiot. I'm not here to be a moron. I'm not here to buy every new
[44:17.560 --> 44:24.000]  fraud that's crammed down my throat. I'm done, and I'm angry. And I break with this whole
[44:24.000 --> 44:32.920]  matrix system, this whole fake lie. And I break with the fear, I break with all of it.
[44:32.920 --> 44:40.060]  Because giving into fear is like a prison, it's horrible. I can't imagine what it's like
[44:40.060 --> 44:47.420]  to live in it. I can't imagine what it's like to turn myself over to it so a bunch of perverts
[44:47.420 --> 44:52.440]  and scammer politicians can sit up there and lick their lips and threaten me with terrorists
[44:52.440 --> 44:59.520]  if I don't bear my loins to some pervert at the airport.
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.260]  And I've watched these TSA people and they're rubbing people down and they're getting off
[45:04.260 --> 45:16.280]  on it. It is a hallucination. It is, it is insanity. It is crazy how by successful approximation,
[45:16.280 --> 45:22.720]  by increments, the system has trained us to accept basically anything.
[45:22.720 --> 45:27.240]  And now Fast and Furious comes out, Monsanto knowing that their crops are destroying the
[45:27.240 --> 45:32.720]  biosphere comes out. I've got news on that. Just hundreds and hundreds of huge facts of
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.360]  total corruption come out. And it almost has the opposite effect. Well, that's just the
[45:36.360 --> 45:37.360]  way it is.
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.360]  Nothing you can do about it. Yeah, nothing you can do about it cuz you've just decided
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.260]  to sit there on your butt because you think you're winning by not caring and getting your
[45:46.260 --> 45:56.200]  MSG chips and your giant leader, big gulp of aspartame and curling up on your couch
[45:56.200 --> 45:57.880]  and not caring.
[45:57.880 --> 46:04.800]  So you can be shot up with a bunch of vaccines. So 10 years from now you can be shriveled
[46:04.800 --> 46:11.120]  down to 85 pounds, vomiting your guts out begging for mommy as you die of cancer with
[46:11.120 --> 46:16.520]  30 years cut off your life. And the New World Order says, well, they're animals, so they
[46:16.520 --> 46:17.520]  deserve to die.
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.320]  And then you let them set up a system and you buy into being an animal so that they
[46:22.320 --> 46:25.800]  can play their little game with you. Cuz the New World Order has all these sick little
[46:25.800 --> 46:31.120]  rules I figured out. You have to let them in. You have to opt in. You have to decide
[46:31.120 --> 46:35.840]  to be an animal. You have to decide to go along with this. Well, not me, not me.
[46:35.840 --> 46:43.440]  I'll tell you, New World Order people are the animals. You think you're so tough cuz
[46:43.440 --> 46:49.280]  you're so hard. You're not hard. You enjoy this stuff. You're worms. You're like cancer.
[46:49.280 --> 46:54.240]  Is cancer winning when it races with the body? No, it's killing its own host. You're aberrant.
[46:54.240 --> 47:00.200]  You're malfunctioning. You're diseased. You're pathetic. You're weak and you will fail of
[47:00.200 --> 47:03.080]  your own weight.
[47:03.080 --> 47:11.200]  This whole plastic fake system is going down. And it's not gonna be pretty. The Globals
[47:11.200 --> 47:16.340]  think they're gonna ride this tiger? Yeah, you're gonna ride it just like the guy Slim
[47:16.340 --> 47:21.000]  Pickens at the end of Dr. Strangelove riding that hydrogen bomb down. You're not coming
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  out of this.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.240]  Just get that through your little pea brain. You think the dark force that energizes you
[47:26.240 --> 47:29.880]  is planning to actually give you all this power? Why don't you read the old parables
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.480]  of the genie? You ask for 5,000 pounds of gold, you better tell them where to put it
[47:35.480 --> 47:38.840]  cuz they're gonna give it to you and drop it right on your head.
[47:38.840 --> 47:45.240]  In those parables is a lot of truth. Be careful what you ask for. Be careful what you want.
[47:45.240 --> 47:50.600]  You're attracted to death and power? Wait till you've actually stuck your arm in there.
[47:50.600 --> 47:58.200]  You're gonna find out what you were looking for.
[47:58.200 --> 48:03.360]  So all of this is going on. Now, shifting gears into some positive news. For every action,
[48:03.360 --> 48:11.840]  there's an equal and opposite reaction. Newtonian physics, proven accurate. Basic laws of this
[48:11.840 --> 48:23.980]  dimension. Basic primitive laws. Ron Paul, a powerful second in New Hampshire with the
[48:23.980 --> 48:34.160]  entire global mouthpiece zombie control signal telling people with the endless group of narcissistic
[48:34.160 --> 48:42.240]  ghouls telling you in their little Skeksi outfits, their fine gowns to impress you at
[48:42.240 --> 48:46.600]  the king's court and make you feel small, with the big architecture behind them to make
[48:46.600 --> 48:54.240]  you feel little. There they are, perched on high, telling you Ron Paul can't win and now
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.840]  there's, first he couldn't win, first he couldn't get two points.
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.560]  Now okay, he is in second place nationwide in almost every major state, but he still
[49:01.560 --> 49:08.460]  can't win. The nominee is Mitt Romney, is Mitt Romney and they just are gonna say that
[49:08.460 --> 49:16.080]  and say that like a group of parrots forever. But it doesn't matter even if they steal elections,
[49:16.080 --> 49:21.080]  even if Ron Paul loses, he wins by engaging and developing a movement and developing an
[49:21.080 --> 49:22.240]  idea.
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.680]  Think of where we've come in four years, think of where we're going in four and people say,
[49:26.680 --> 49:31.100]  well, they can kill Ron Paul. What, and make him an icon even bigger? Kill me, turn me
[49:31.100 --> 49:40.040]  into an icon, strike me down, become more powerful than you can possibly imagine? They
[49:40.040 --> 49:44.440]  can't strike you down, they can't strike. This is it, we are unlocking people's minds.
[49:44.440 --> 49:49.480]  Most people are not bad, most people are not evil, most people are not corrupt, they believe
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.600]  this false system. We've got to fight with the truth and our ideology of liberty against
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.840]  the ideology of globalism and bondage and despotism.
[49:57.840 --> 50:02.720]  It's not a hard sell, you want what made America great liberty and pointing your ship that
[50:02.720 --> 50:07.200]  direction never meant we actually got there, but we were going in the right direction.
[50:07.200 --> 50:13.120]  Going towards the sunshine, towards the fertile fields, towards the goodness, towards transparency,
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.120]  towards honor, towards small government, towards family and everything that's good.
[50:18.120 --> 50:23.920]  Instead of our ship in these dark waters where the sea stinks and the crews dying and our
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.080]  teeth are falling out and there's big waves and there's a big tempest, giant storm on
[50:29.080 --> 50:32.460]  the horizon and we're going full blast into that.
[50:32.460 --> 50:36.720]  And Ron Paul and others are trying to turn the ship and there's all these little scared
[50:36.720 --> 50:43.280]  minions up there bought off by the bankers, fiat money, by their Ponzi scheme, stabbing
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.760]  at us and saying no and we're fighting over the wheel, fighting over the wheel.
[50:47.760 --> 50:51.840]  But more and more people who are on the sidelines are going, why are those zombies fighting
[50:51.840 --> 50:55.560]  with them over the wheel? We obviously want to go back towards the sun, we want to go
[50:55.560 --> 50:59.560]  back towards the calm, we want to go back to where it's good.
[50:59.560 --> 51:07.400]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[51:07.400 --> 51:12.480]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[51:12.480 --> 51:19.440]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[51:19.440 --> 51:20.440]  your help.

[51:25.680 --> 51:32.200]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[51:32.200 --> 51:37.800]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[51:37.800 --> 51:41.360]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[51:41.360 --> 51:48.800]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[51:48.800 --> 51:57.680]  and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus
[51:57.680 --> 52:00.960]  the mindset of 1984.
[52:00.960 --> 52:05.240]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[52:05.240 --> 52:09.700]  filtration. As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years and serving thousands of

[53:04.120 --> 53:07.540]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[53:07.540 --> 53:11.860]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[53:11.860 --> 53:16.680]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[53:16.680 --> 53:20.800]  makes the same light as a real television so from outside it looks like someone is home
[53:20.800 --> 53:25.520]  watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but is far more convincing
[53:25.520 --> 53:30.800]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm and is highly recommended
[53:30.800 --> 53:35.080]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake
[53:35.080 --> 53:43.320]  TV for only $34.95 go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake TV is
[53:43.320 --> 53:48.520]  only $29.95 so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security and peace
[53:48.520 --> 53:58.040]  of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com. Faketv.com. The burglar
[53:58.040 --> 54:22.920]  deterrent.
[54:22.920 --> 54:39.720]  Well, that's not manly though. Manly is to kill a bunch of brown people and breathe D.U.
[54:39.720 --> 54:45.720]  and come back and have deformed children. You know, last night we aired a little promo
[54:45.720 --> 54:51.040]  video for a group that brings Iraqi and Afghan children to the U.S. You have their arms and
[54:51.040 --> 54:55.240]  legs blown off, their eyeballs blown out and who never got medical treatment. Some of them
[54:55.240 --> 54:56.240]  have shrapnel in their spines.
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.480]  They get a medical treatment. And I saw comments on the YouTube that we posted this morning
[55:00.480 --> 55:07.480]  on the Nightly News saying how dare you? They wanna kill us. They're animals. You're a traitor.
[55:07.480 --> 55:13.640]  We're gonna get to Hodges. And I tracked back some of people's, you know, they're tracked
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.640]  them back to their pages and it was all just pro war, pro death.
[55:17.640 --> 55:23.400]  You see, they have to say they're savages when they see children they've maimed and
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.040]  blown the tops of their heads off or blown their little mandibles off and their tongues
[55:27.040 --> 55:30.880]  are flopping all around in pain. They've got to say good. They're animals. They deserve
[55:30.880 --> 55:36.400]  to die. A couple days ago, I was on the radio with Opie and Anthony and it was early in
[55:36.400 --> 55:37.400]  the morning.
[55:37.400 --> 55:43.080]  I was half awake. I did an OK job, but I probably should have been a lot meaner to him in hindsight.
[55:43.080 --> 55:49.040]  And then they go, here's Chris Kyle, the sniper, who claims all this about Jesse Ventura. And
[55:49.040 --> 55:52.560]  I should have brought up, you know, you say these are all savages, including the women
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.840]  you shot.
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.960]  But I didn't even bring that up because it's so over the top. But see, you've got to do
[55:59.960 --> 56:04.100]  that. I mean, if you're killing soldiers in a uniform who are trying to kill you, it's
[56:04.100 --> 56:08.120]  just a foreign enemy. You're part of this country. They're part of that. You don't have
[56:08.120 --> 56:09.800]  to call them savages.
[56:09.800 --> 56:14.120]  But no, see, when you're mainly killing men, women and children are tired of being occupied
[56:14.120 --> 56:19.840]  or it just little kids that you bombed. Most of the people in there celebrating this, they
[56:19.840 --> 56:25.560]  actually would freak out if they saw a child with their lower mandible blown off and would.
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.160]  These are cowardly people. These aren't actually soldiers that were part of it who were saying
[56:29.160 --> 56:35.080]  it's OK. No, it's just these soft people who who think it's real tough and they get very
[56:35.080 --> 56:39.480]  upset by seeing these little kids that I played the video on the news.
[56:39.480 --> 56:44.040]  So if any of our listeners wanted to financially check it out, maybe support because I've also
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.380]  supported when the V.A. won't take care of U.S. troops that get hurt. I've supported
[56:48.380 --> 56:52.240]  some of those groups, too, whether it's our troops, which aren't really our troops anymore.
[56:52.240 --> 56:57.360]  They're globalist troops. They're still Americans who've been used or whether it's little little
[56:57.360 --> 56:58.360]  brown kids.
[56:58.360 --> 57:07.240]  I mean, I. Do I have a soft heart? You know, I don't think so. I think I have a heart.
[57:07.240 --> 57:13.040]  And I also am God fearing. And, you know, God's just God. Let me tell you, we're going
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.560]  to pay for all that in spades, even though America was hijacked and was finagled into
[57:18.560 --> 57:19.560]  it.
[57:19.560 --> 57:24.680]  We will still be punished for all of that. Man, that's a scary thing. I can feel God.
[57:24.680 --> 57:33.800]  I can feel justice. I'm really worried about America. I'm worried about all of us. Because
[57:33.800 --> 57:41.520]  it's it's bad. And, you know, if we just said what we did was wrong and repented.
[57:41.520 --> 57:47.220]  Then that would offer us a great deal of protection, but we won't. Instead, many people dance in
[57:47.220 --> 57:55.280]  the blood of the innocents. They rub it all over themselves. They spiritually fornicate
[57:55.280 --> 58:07.040]  with unclean ideas, spirits. They they they they buy into it. And I didn't get into the
[58:07.040 --> 58:10.400]  positive news with Ron Paul yet because I got off into that.
[58:10.400 --> 58:17.680]  But Ron Paul does say he's nipping at the white Obama's heels. Mitt Romney, the white
[58:17.680 --> 58:29.240]  Obama. Oh, that'd be a good video to make. Meet the white Obama. We've got to destroy
[58:29.240 --> 58:33.720]  Mitt Romney because it's been a long time since we actually had a presidential candidate
[58:33.720 --> 58:37.520]  that wasn't a globalist puppet. His name's Ron Paul. We got to get behind him. Stay with
[58:37.520 --> 58:50.960]  me. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.960 --> 58:55.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing nonhybrid
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.600]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[58:59.600 --> 59:04.160]  nonhybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[59:04.160 --> 59:08.520]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[59:08.520 --> 59:12.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of nonhybrid
[59:12.680 --> 59:18.760]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[59:18.760 --> 59:23.280]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[59:23.280 --> 59:28.660]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[59:28.660 --> 59:34.340]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[59:34.340 --> 59:46.000]  a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, nonhybrid seeds
[59:46.000 --> 59:53.960]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[59:53.960 --> 01:00:05.640]  Changing war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:12.680]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:22.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.000]  All right, here's the deal. We've got a lot of other world news, and I'm going to cover
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.320]  it. We're going to go over this hour, but I also want to take your calls on the Iran
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:39.000]  situation, on Ron Paul's turbocharging, a strong second in New Hampshire. He's in first
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.720]  or second in Nevada and other juicy states.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.320]  Santorum and his bloodlust for World War III is probably the leader down in Florida,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:55.360]  so Paul is not gonna be contesting that state, obviously, and wasting people's money. But
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:04.960]  again, now is the time to be supporting our omnibudsman, our elder statesman, Ron Paul.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.640]  Now is the time to get behind him like never before. I won't open the phones up on any
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.200]  of the issues I've mentioned or any issues you want to get into.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.360]  We've also got the footage and audio coming up of the police officer. Just absolutely
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:27.720]  Mike Tyson punching a special needs mentally challenged woman. So it's very manly, though.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:38.880]  I get upset by this video because it's so manly to beat up a retarded person that it's
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.320]  so manly that I'm feeling weak right now.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.940]  I'm feeling pathetic right now. I wish I was man enough to do this, and I'm intimidated
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:56.720]  by it. It makes you feel small to see this type of manhood in action. This is what it's
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.040]  all about. This is what America is all about. In fact, maybe the American flag shouldn't
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.080]  be a sheep sticking its head in the ground, the ostrich sheep, the ostrich sheeple.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.460]  Maybe it should be like an old lady or like a mentally retarded child with a cop beating
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:18.240]  their head in, because that's freedom. After all, she angered his ego. She called him the
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:28.200]  big man. And well, they show her, you can call me big man, call me big shot, show you
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.680]  big shot.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.240]  And then the cop, he's not done there. I know, there's somebody on the bus back 15 feet away
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:46.640]  videotaping it. You don't do that in America. You don't do that in America, buddy boy. So
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:55.000]  they are trying to convert the police over into a bunch of really shameful people. I
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.840]  know most police still aren't like this, a lot of them are.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:14.600]  And to me, it's shameful. I just don't feel tough hitting a woman. And I really don't
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:20.760]  feel tough with a badge and a gun and then quote authority, cold cocking somebody because
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.840]  they said something to me I didn't like.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:31.480]  It's like something a 10-year-old would do. I had quite a few girlfriends and I've got
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.640]  a theory about women. One of the crew members actually has this theory, I think it's true.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.840]  Half of the women out there are 50% crazy and the other half are completely crazy. But
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:50.080]  men are crazy as well. I have a theory about men. Half the men out there are 50% crazy
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.800]  and the other half are 100% crazy.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.480]  Women can't live with them, can't live without them. But I have had many girlfriends over
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.680]  the years who we get in an argument with you and if you wouldn't argue with them, they
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.800]  start hitting you or clawing you or whatever. And I never really even had like if a man
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.560]  did it, it's like an automatic challenge and you beat the daylights out of them.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:20.960]  When a woman does it, it's more like a flailing, it's almost laughable and they can really
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.560]  get mad when you start laughing at them. But I have held down girlfriends and stuff like
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:30.200]  that when they're clawing at you and stuff. And then they always get real mad, now you're
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.920]  attacking me. I'm like, no, I'm keeping you from doing something to me.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.800]  The point is this woman didn't do any of that. She just simply got in his face saying stuff
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:44.400]  to him and so he punches her full power and then goes after somebody's first amendment
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:54.840]  to videotape him. So that's coming up, 800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:05:01.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.200]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.800]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.640]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.100]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:24.800]  Lungs generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and

[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.040]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to

[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:07.000]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.800]  a war on for your mind.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:17.160]  All right, we're eight minutes into hour number two. I'm Alex Jones, your host. And if you're
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.960]  just tuning in for the first time, you found it, ladies and gentlemen, this is a talk radio
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.200]  like no other. We simulcast the entire three-hour radio show every day and live streaming video
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.520]  at prisonplanet.tv for subscribers. We're also offering a system right now where you
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:38.520]  can watch portions of the show live at infowars.com. There's a big icon saying watch now.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.680]  We're attempting to secure more server farms and bandwidth to offer the entire daytime
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.320]  radio slash TV show for free for everybody video wise. The audio is obviously free, but
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.860]  we're looking at budgetary issues and things. Be able to offer that soon. Right now it kicks
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.760]  you off after about 20 minutes. The free audio stream is there. But that's not the reason
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.040]  that we're unlike other media. Yeah, I crawled up from nowhere, built my own system. That's
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.040]  different.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:12.080]  I talk about real issues. I'm shattering the left right paradigm. The distractions and
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.080]  diversions that are put out there to blind us from the real world. Our planet has been
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.400]  captured by six mega banks that control the central banks of almost every nation in the
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.880]  world. The ultra rich actually control the money. They're not trying to make money. They
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.240]  literally make the money. And so they always want to get your country, your individual,
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.720]  your company, your town in debt.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.340]  And because the engine of free market is so powerful, they've never been able to do that
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:44.840]  even with wars to a true servitude level. So now they've just put all their politicians
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:52.320]  in place and had them shine on to the 1,500 conservative trillion. That's 1,500 trillion
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:59.440]  with a capital T, and now have signed the world onto it.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:06.580]  The world's waking up, so they wanna start a big war as another distraction for that.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:12.040]  As I say, war is the health of the state, grows the state throughout history. And so
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:20.820]  the state itself piloted and hijacked by miscreant New World Order acolytes is taking us into
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.120]  a very, very dark waters indeed. I wanna take your phone calls in this hour.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:33.120]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231. And I do see Rocco, Ronnie, Don, Gary, Rob,
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.520]  and many others that are holding. We will be getting to all of you today. But first
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:44.060]  off, I wanna hit some more Ron Paul news. Again, obviously, he came in a strong second
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:52.880]  in New Hampshire despite the fact that many zombies, it appears, did vote for Lord Romney.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.040]  Because the media told him this is the only one that can win the Republican nomination.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:06.440]  And they had all these talking parrots, regurgitating and repeating, ad nauseum. Not that Paul wanted
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:12.400]  to crack her, but that Ron Paul couldn't win, would never win. It's impossible, he's pathetic,
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.560]  he's dangerous, he's this, he's that.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:22.200]  He wants you to die in a nuclear war, something they used against one of his idols, Barry
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.560]  Goldwater, who fought the globalist and exposed the Trilateral Commission and CFR. In fact,
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.600]  guys, will you print me Barry Goldwater quote on Trilateral Commission? It's the longer
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.160]  one about how they're taking over the country.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:39.840]  And when I read this quote, you'll know how accurate it is. And here we are 40 years later,
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:46.800]  when he was running against LBJ, on an anti-war candidacy, by the way, but from a conservative,
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.200]  true conservative position and nationalist position. They ran ads for a little girl standing
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.360]  there with a flower, and then a hydrogen bomb goes off and kills her.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:07.840]  It's like, don't vote for Goldwater, he wants to kill your baby. But despite them throwing
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.600]  everything they've got against Ron Paul, he is in first or second in almost every state.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.320]  And he's gaining momentum. And if so-called conservatives and people just snap their fingers
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:27.080]  and go, hey, wake up, wake up. Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare, the Massachusetts law that
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:34.620]  he wrote it. Mitt Romney's for abortion, open borders, gun control, and a bunch of other
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.080]  carbon taxes.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:44.160]  I mean, he is the white Obama, meet the white Obama, meet the white Obama. I mean, look,
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.640]  that's just like I told people, why are you bashing Obama in the 2008 election? You Republicans,
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:56.200]  you love George Bush, you should love Obama. Banker bailouts, takeovers, everything. Just
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.900]  different rhetoric, hiring lobbyists, all of it.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:06.600]  What they do is the same, the rhetoric's different. Mitt Romney with a little Ken doll face goes,
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:16.800]  I'll overturn Roe v Wade. I mean, he's a liar. At least Obama tells you the truth. Yeah,
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.680]  this is the shorter version of the quote. This is from his book with no apologies. In
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.440]  fact, will you guys get me the, thank you for this one with the larger one from no apologies.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:33.000]  I actually have that book around here somewhere. The Trilateral Commission is intended and
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.720]  is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.720]  interest by seizing control of the political governments of the United States.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.900]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:56.720]  the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical. Clergy response
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:04.040]  teams, anyone? It's a global standardized system. And it doesn't give this Liberty Tree
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:10.120]  quotes where this was said, but this is an excise piece. Yeah, it is. The book, no apologies.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.960]  Mary Goldwater. You know that Jewish guy, Ron Paul supported for president cuz Ron Paul's
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.600]  so antisemitic.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:26.560]  Makes my head spin sometimes. Let's get into some of the other Ron Paul news. He has
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:33.680]  said that it's time for the other candidates to drop out. I mean, some of them got three
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.920]  or four or five points. It is time for them to drop out. Because all those other groups
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.120]  that are gonna stay in there, that's mainly folks that will not vote for a Mormon.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.840]  No matter how you slice it, I'm not getting into Baptist or Mormon or Catholic bashing,
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.760]  okay? If you love God, you love life, you don't like corruption, I like you. It's all
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.460]  this sectarianism that causes all the fighting. I'm not gonna get into judgments here and
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:08.440]  turn this into beat my chest religiously and follow what I believe. I have a personal relationship
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.440]  with my creator.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:15.000]  I can feel it, I know it, I've experienced it. And you know what, I don't really find
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.160]  that in these churches. I don't get a good vibe in them, so that's why I'm not in them.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.800]  Pharisees came to Christ and they said, why don't you come to temple? Why don't you get
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.040]  up there on the hill with us and pray?
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.200]  And he said, I do that in private, my closet. You guys get up there and tell everybody how
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:41.200]  good you are all day up there. But the issue here is that Mitt Romney, depending on how
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:47.080]  you slice it, will probably lose to Obama. He's a former big globalist, heads fun person,
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.520]  all of it. And in a way, it doesn't even matter because you get him in there.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.040]  Now they'll get three or four more years before people figure out, hey, this guy's the same
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:10.000]  as Obama was. Remember all those poor Obama bots? Obama, Obama, Obama. Brang little Obama
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.320]  bot sheep, little Obama sheeple. Thank you, President, I'm gonna get a free car and a
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.560]  free house and all my problems are solved.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.480]  You're gonna take the money from the rich people. There's only $2 trillion in domestic
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.560]  wealth that's left here. I mean, there's globalists that control tens of trillions of peace on
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.040]  record. They're all offshore and exempt from taxes on record. But let's say you took the
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.040]  $2 trillion.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:39.920]  What's that gonna do for the $15 trillion deficit or the GDP that's 15 trillion? Now
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:47.280]  the debt's greater than the entire GDP yearly. But you can't explain that to someone who
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:53.880]  is poor, who is into the entitlement society. Somebody who's poor, trying to put themselves
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.600]  through night school while working two jobs, they understand it.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.820]  And if we keep a free market, they're going to expand the middle class. We can all be
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:05.240]  middle class, we can all be wealthy. Our poorest people are wealthy compared to people 2,000,
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:12.840]  3,000 years ago. There's unlimited potential, but through an incredible free market driven
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:19.440]  liberty based market, there's so much wealth that it's a disruptive technology, is what
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.280]  the globalists call it, and it will unseat their monopolies.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.720]  And technology will accelerate so fast and humans will get life extension. And then our
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.680]  population will become so giant that they'll build cities up and down instead of out. We
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.800]  will colonize space and it's over. And the globalists just don't like that. They romanticize
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.280]  a post-industrial, they're gonna have high tech reservations they go to for new bodies
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.440]  and new tech.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.640]  And the rest of us will be in loin cloths, very small numbers, basically of aborigines
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.760]  that they keep in certain green belt sectors to study primitive humans. And then they will
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.160]  split off into their new species. Now, again, when the New York Times and CBS News attacked
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.320]  me for this and say, I believe this.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:10.640]  No, I don't believe this. I give the quotes in my films and here on air, this is what
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:17.880]  they're setting up. This is a future without us. This is a future that doesn't need us.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:24.560]  The elites have decided we've got robots, we've got drones, we don't want you anymore.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.760]  And the ultimate exercise of power, the big gleaming switch that ensures that they get
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.920]  what they want, at least to one level, is to release the super bio weapons and kill
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.960]  the majority of the people.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:45.040]  And they'll go into their armored redoubts and the military all be happy to be there.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.520]  Select military and COG and then emerge after it and be given the cure and the antidote
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:57.400]  and then be integrated into the new future. And I'm telling you, they're planning this.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:06.080]  So you talk about doomsday, folks, this is gonna be bad. And you could say, well, okay,
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.000]  we've seen the globalists talk about this and set it up.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.920]  We see the architecture going in that way, the whole global societal infrastructure architecture.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.680]  But will they really do it? I don't know. I mean, I know they're already playing with
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.760]  us like a cat plays with a mouse for 20 minutes before it eats it. We got blood coming out
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.420]  our eye, we're scratched, our back legs are broken, the cat's playing with us.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:35.520]  It's dumping heavy metals into the food and water. All these other poisons, deadly vaccines,
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:42.560]  all the degenerative diseases exploding, cancer. And I'm like, I don't know, they've sure done
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.800]  a lot of other horrible stuff though. I mean, here's CBS News where they're shooting kids
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800]  up with live polio.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.060]  Here's another one killing newborn babies with these shots. I mean, I don't know. They
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.240]  say they're gonna do it. They've always done everything they say they're gonna do. The
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.640]  cops are like, we want to beat some old ladies up right now.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:05.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:10.440]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.120]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.440]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.000]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect

[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:00.680]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.000]  this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors

[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:14.280]  Come, you masters of war, here to build the big guns, here to build the death planes.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:19.640]  So it's time for the other candidates to step down like Michelle Bachman did. They're not
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:25.840]  gonna win. It's between Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. The only person challenging Mitt Romney
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:33.920]  is Ron Paul. Now the prostitute media is doing something that's illogical, if you think logically,
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.160]  but may work on some sheeple.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.740]  They're doing a couple things. They're saying everybody should stay in cuz it's still an
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:48.140]  open race. But Ron Paul can't win and should drop out because there's no way he'll ever
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:53.840]  be the nominee. No, he's in second place undisputed across the country. Came in second place in
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.160]  New Hampshire, third place and there was a lot of chicanery, probably one in Iowa.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.280]  That's even come out in the local papers that, yeah, Karl Rove reported, the people didn't
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:09.840]  show up with the votes. We just decided Santorum went up six points or whatever. And so Ron
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.100]  Paul's out there saying, no, it's time for all of you to drop out and all those other
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.100]  folks are anti-Romney.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:20.000]  They're gonna go to Paul and he's gonna have more points than Romney, if you break down
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  the numbers. And in different polls, he beats Obama by more points than Mitt Romney does.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.900]  And I don't trust Mitt Romney as far as I could throw him. I mean, he is a globalist
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.480]  who is for the socialist healthcare, for all the rest of the garbage.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:46.000]  Now he'll tell you what you wanna hear. But I mean, haven't you been conned before? I
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.720]  mean, the idiots that said that Obama was like Jesus, remember that? And he was gonna
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:59.640]  save us and he was the one and Pepsi got behind it. I mean, haven't you learned people that
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.920]  all this hype is just that hype?
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:08.280]  It's hot air. Here's Ron Paul talking about nipping on Mittie's heels. Here it is.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:13.920]  I called Governor Romney a short while ago before he gave his talk and congratulate him
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:26.320]  because he certainly had a clear cut victory, but we're nibbling at his heels. But there
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.680]  was another victory tonight. He had a victory, but we have had a victory for the cause of
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:39.040]  liberty tonight.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:46.620]  There is no doubt that this whole effort that we are involved in will not go unnoticed.
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:51.920]  Let me tell you.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.440]  You only lose when you don't get in the game. You only lose when you give up. Don't you
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.880]  get it? Everybody's learning about the New World Order and torture and wars and the Federal
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.840]  Reserve. This is, I mean, if the Bilderberg Group in 2006 was pulling their hair out about
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.920]  the liberty movement growing, the militia movement, the Patriot movement.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:22.760]  Ron Paul was just mentioned in there as one of the main constellation points. Now, it's
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  just, it's surging, it's growing. If you look at the exponential growth curve, it's just
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:34.680]  stratospheric. And we've all got a responsibility, those of us that represent liberty and freedom
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.660]  and dignity and the republic.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:49.960]  We really carry with us the remnant of what made America great. We carry with us really
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:28:00.560]  the republic's family jewels. We were the example to live by for freedom worldwide.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.280]  America was admired. We were the good guys. We weren't perfect, but compared to everybody
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.600]  else, we were the good guys. We were the excelers. We had the highest test scores. We had the
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.320]  toughest men. We had the most inventors.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.780]  We were the people that never gave up. We were the ornery folks that didn't put up with
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:20.680]  government tyranny and didn't get bossed around by bureaucracy, everywhere else where humanity
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:27.800]  was bent over under the whip of bureaucrats and paramilitary police. We were the people
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:34.440]  that were willing to go to the end, were willing to die.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:40.240]  That iconic image worldwide, and now look at us, we were taken over. We were fed poison,
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:48.500]  cultural and physical poison. We were beguiled, but now the giant is poisoned and sick but
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:54.240]  still incredibly powerful. And anytime it wants to, we can break the trance and stand.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:29:00.880]  And the giant's now awake at the edge of the bed in an incredible hangover, little globalist
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.100]  demons crawling all over it trying to suck the blood out of it.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.480]  But just the fact that it's woken up, the heart's beating, the strength is reviving
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:13.540]  it and we are there breathing a life into it. And worldwide people see Ron Paul, they
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:17.920]  see the Liberty Movement, they see the common sense, they see the goodness. And there's
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:27.440]  Ron Paul type movements all over the world to rediscover true freedom.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:34.720]  This is a revolution of ideas and ideas are bulletproof. No army can stop an idea whose
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:40.480]  time has come. The New World Order asked us to kneel and be their slaves. All Ron Paul
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:47.560]  is asking, all I'm asking is that you stand. Is that cruel? We'll be right back with your
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:50.560]  phone calls.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:57.040]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.480]  oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:27.560]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity

[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:41.600]  Nowadays, Americana is evil. So I guess Elvis is with Al Qaeda. I guess all of us are except
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.560]  for the folks that actually run Al Qaeda up there at the Pentagon.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:52.240]  Here are some of the quotes out of Barry Goldwater's book and I'll go to your calls. Here's a page
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.600]  284 of no apologies. The Trilateral Commission already read this earlier, but I'll get to
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.800]  the new ones. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:09.520]  and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:13.920]  All this is to be done in the interest of creating a more peaceful, more productive
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.160]  world community. Throughout my public life and in these pages, I have refrained from
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:24.320]  judging other men's motives. I have no hesitancy about judging their wisdom and the results
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.920]  of the actions taken.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:32.320]  And he goes on to talk about how it's really evil. Page 285, what the Trilateralists truly
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.120]  intend is the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:44.000]  of the nation states involved. They believe the abundant materialism they propose to create
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:51.240]  will overwhelmingly existing differences and managers and creators of the system, they
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.000]  will rule the future.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  Here's another one, page 286. David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.920]  in him, their ideal candidate. They helped him win the nomination in the presidency.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.520]  To accomplish this purpose, they mobilized the power and the money power of Wall Street
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:15.320]  bankers, the intellectual influence of the academic community, which is subservient to
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:20.120]  the wealth of the great tax-free foundations. And the media controllers represented in the
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:26.240]  membership of the Council on Foreign Relations and CFR, or CFR and Trilateral Commission.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:33.560]  Continuing page 299, we have arrived at our present position of peril in a world and at
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.760]  home because our leaders have refused to tell us the truth unless we profess to believe
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:43.800]  in freedom, wake up, the world is headed for a period of slavery.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:52.600]  He wrote this back in the 1970s, 1979. That's excerpts of the no apologies, the personal
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:36:01.760]  and political memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater, 1979. And a lot of people
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:06.320]  think well, if the TV says that that's establishment, I'll go with that and I'll be establishment.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:14.120]  No, you're following the edicts and the ideas of radical globalist who are anti-human and
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:20.720]  who see you as dog meat. And they've been very good at making it all look very reasonable
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.720]  what they're doing.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.200]  All right, I'm going to your calls and a bunch of other news ahead of Stuart Rhodes joining
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:33.880]  us to break down what's happening. Constitutional law scholar, Yale graduate, top of his class,
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.320]  Army paratrooper, ranger, the whole nine yards. Worked for Ron Paul for many years. We'll
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:47.760]  get his take on Ron Paul upfront, then we'll get into his thesis paper a decade or so ago,
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:53.880]  getting into martial law, how it can be brought to America, the NDAA, and the fact that you
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.320]  can't legalize tyranny.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.200]  So that's coming up with Stuart Rhodes. And we'll also take some calls towards the end
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:06.920]  of the interview with Stuart. But here we are now an hour and 36 minutes into the transmission
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:13.080]  or 37 minutes in and I haven't plugged anything. A, everything I promote and plug. When you
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.720]  hear me intro something, you hear me promoting something with my voice, it means I believe
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.720]  in it.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.460]  Now you can take that for what it's worth, but whatever I promote, I'm into. And you
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:28.240]  heard a caller a few days ago, I meant to elaborate on it and I didn't say, Alex, I
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:36.160]  have your bumper sticker infowars.com on my car. And everywhere I go, the police are fans
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.900]  because a lot of good police out there and people at the university are listeners.
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.200]  And he said, every four or five people I talked to, at least one of them is a listener now,
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:51.760]  you're really starting to reach critical mass. Yeah, not only do you support us when you
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.920]  buy an infowars.com t-shirt, you're going to meet like minded people. You wanna meet
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.640]  people that are into liberty?
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:09.320]  Wear an infowars.com shirt, have an infowars.com bumper sticker, have it in the Fed sticker.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:13.800]  And we sell a whole bunch of bumper stickers at cost, by the way. We've just gotten some
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:19.080]  new bumper stickers in some new designs, by the way. So they're at cost, what it cost
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.640]  us. In fact, they tried to get me to raise the prices a little bit back in the warehouse
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.240]  cuz they're like, you're actually losing money on this.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:30.760]  But the point is, I wanna get this information out and that's how we reach new people. That's
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.720]  why when I say when you buy my films, get them, make copies, Obama deception, Fall of
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:40.320]  the Republic, Endgame, the film I produced, Invisible Empire, which is excellent. Give
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.360]  them to people, air them on access TV.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.840]  Again, we have this idea that we all have to beat the New World Order by ourselves overnight.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:55.400]  Well, there's not some dragon we can't corner in some cave and stab it in the heart. Well,
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:02.320]  then I'm not gonna do it. Civilizations are built and tyrannies are defeated inch by inch,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.720]  centimeter by centimeter, millimeter by millimeter.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:13.360]  And right now, we're gaining thousands of miles on the New World Order. I mean, the
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.200]  New World Order is stalling and trying to get everything done right now because it's
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:25.720]  running out of grease. It's like a big metal machine that's seizing up. Meanwhile, oil's
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.720]  pumping through us.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:33.360]  I mean, we're getting more and more powerful, stronger and stronger. That's why the cornered
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:38.440]  rat that still has a lot of power is gonna pull out all the stops. I mean, we are at
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:48.280]  an amazing threshold, flashpoint, jump point, crossroads, tectonic shift, quickening, climax,
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:51.880]  acceleration, great time of change.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:57.960]  Did I say quickening? I mean, it's here. And it's just gonna get wilder, as I keep telling
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:08.000]  you. We're gonna look back on 2012 as a cakewalk. But in all that adversity comes great.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.200]  Opportunity. I mean, we were dying because we were living in slow death, slow New World
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:21.520]  Order, hidden. Now it's coming out in the open. Now it's saying, okay, we tried to be
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.080]  cloaked to sell our agenda, but that didn't work.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:30.200]  So now we're uncloaking. Look at how scary we are. Look at all the murders and death
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:38.920]  and evil, aren't you intimidated? And people are going, no, I'm not intimidated. I mean,
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:44.640]  really at the moment that they uncloak themselves as the vampire-like psychic vampire globalist
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:53.000]  they are, as they uncloak themselves, are we supposed to now just run under the table?
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.880]  Or get mad at the messenger? No, this is what you were born to do. You were born to be here
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:05.600]  now. You're part of a generation that's seeing shifts in technology and culture and computing
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:14.760]  power that instead of just exponentially get wilder, we are involved in an amazing time.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:22.680]  And it's just gonna get wilder and crazier and stranger and more fantastical by the minute.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.200]  And you notice some people are waking up to that and going, wow, others are getting more
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:33.200]  complacent. Things are boring. Nothing's going on. I'm sick of my iPad. Those are zombies,
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.560]  folks, totally in the matrix.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:44.480]  I mean, this morning I walked on the back porch and it was a frosty morning, giant moon
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:56.400]  in the sky, champagne sunrise, cup of coffee, 6 AM, and I was just like, wow. The leafless
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:07.380]  black woods, the hill, watched a horse and a donkey and the ranch across from me, nibbling
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:20.560]  at the grass, heard coyotes howling, turkeys gobbling. It's unbelievable.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:28.480]  And you can walk out anywhere you want and see beauty. One place you really see it is
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:40.840]  in the electric inquisitiveness and goodness of a child's eyes. And it is for the children
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:46.960]  that we do what we do. So don't let this train pass you by. Don't sit on the sidelines while
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.300]  the greatest events in human history are just beginning to unfold.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:58.400]  It's like the concert and you've heard them warming up. And it's an interesting sound,
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:09.860]  but suddenly the music is coming alive with the opening ballad. And this whole thing is
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:18.140]  about to begin. The good, the bad, the ugly, all of it in this huge passion play with real
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:25.740]  people on the stage, a planet, hurtling through space at tens of thousands of miles an hour,
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:32.740]  circling a giant ball of flame with the nebulas in the universe all around us.
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:38.900]  And our wives and our husbands and our grandparents and our ancestors before and streaming out
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:51.760]  our progeny to come. It's unbelievable. I mean, these idiots don't know that there isn't
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:44:00.780]  a creator of all this. They can't resonate with it and feel it. You know what's good.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:12.420]  You know what's bad. You know the law of the universe. You know ugly from beauty. You know
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:18.700]  innocence from corruption. All right, I'm gonna stop preaching.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:23.940]  The point is that I was gonna do a short plug for waking people up, books, videos, and you
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:27.940]  support us, infowars.com, the t-shirts, all of it. And we're running that special for
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:31.900]  a few more weeks where you can get all of my films for 70 plus percent off the everything
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:32.900]  special.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:37.140]  Great weapon in the info war. We've also got a bunch of new films we're carrying like A
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:44.980]  Noble Lie, the Oklahoma City inside job movie. Excellent to expose the vampires. And yeah,
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:51.100]  there it is. Okay, I'm done plugging, infowars.com or 888-25-33139. Rocco, thank you for holding
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:58.940]  from North Carolina. How about them bears or how about them cowboys? How about that
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:04.820]  Ron Paul? They keep saying he can't win. The underdog is rising, rising. What do you say
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:06.940]  about that?
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:11.100]  We know. We know. We know some people are talking the truth, but we're not gonna hear
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:15.900]  that in corporate media. It may be a coincidence, Alex, but I don't know if you've visited Worldnet
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:21.380]  Deli's website. It really looks like info wars now. They redid the whole website, but
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:27.060]  the content doesn't. They ran a hit piece yesterday called the Ron Paul Saul Alinsky.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:31.380]  It was terrible. The good thing is though, they did put up comments. They didn't take
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:35.820]  them down. You have people, I was putting up links and stuff, but again, it looks like
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.500]  info wars, but the content is not quite there yet.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:47.740]  Well, I mean, Joseph Farah overall walks a line between being kind of neo-con, pro-war
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:52.380]  because he is Lebanese and I know the Lebanese Christians have been persecuted and that does
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:46:02.900]  happen. And so he is kind of a lacudnik. He's super pro what you'd call right wing Israel,
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.740]  but it's left wing, right wing. It's all made up.
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:11.020]  And then separately, they do a lot of anti-globalist stuff over the years. And I think overall
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:18.420]  Worldnet Deli has done a good job. I mean, they've done more harm than good. Obviously,
[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:23.860]  people are too weak-minded, a lot of them to really face the truth. I mean, the truth
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:30.300]  is horrific. I mean, I was on more radio stations 12 years ago or 11 years ago than I am now.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:35.260]  I'm on a lot bigger ones and stuff, so we have exponentially more listeners. We're on
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:40.300]  XM and a lot of other stuff, and number one on the Internet. But stations were calling
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:44.100]  when I was saying 9-11's an inside job. I mean, I saw Building 7 blow up. I had all
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:47.180]  the evidence and they were calling saying, and they all thought I was gonna stop.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:51.020]  They said, tell Mr. Jones that he's gonna stop that or he won't be on next week. And
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:55.340]  I said, well, just tell him sorry, I'm not gonna stop. And I said, if you got a problem
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:47:01.140]  with that, Ted, I'll just leave. And he said, no, no, I'm gonna back your First Amendment.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:04.740]  I'm not saying you should stop. We're just getting all these calls. And I called a few
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:07.740]  of the stations and I said, look, here's the evidence. They said, I don't wanna hear it.
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:12.140]  I don't wanna hear the evidence. I just can't have this. And I'm like, I understand. I'm
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:17.100]  not trying to get in your face. I'm not trying to say I'm gonna do what I want just to be
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.100]  naughty.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:23.100]  I cannot sell out what I believe to be true, okay? I cannot compromise that, just not gonna
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:29.420]  happen. And so about 70% of the stations I was on dumped my show. Everybody was like,
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:36.660]  ha ha, look at Alex Jones. That was, I didn't even think about it. I mean, it's not debatable.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:41.940]  Why even be on the air if you're not telling the truth? Why even be on the air if you're
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:46.180]  not going to the hard places? But I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:50.660]  Hey, Alex, can I plug a website, local pay sheets in North Carolina?
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.340]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:59.100]  It's founderstruth.org, founderstruth.org. We're educating voters, trying to get voters
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.900]  to think in terms of the Constitution, and we're looking for candidates we can support
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.780]  that will support the Constitution locally.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:11.980]  All right, buddy, I appreciate that. I've been really ranting here. Don in Michigan,
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:12.980]  you're on the air.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:14.980]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:15.980]  Hey, buddy.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:22.820]  Hey, just a couple quick points about a question before I explain to the listeners. One thing
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:26.220]  is listen at work. I mean, this is so simple. I take my iPhone, I have a little speaker
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:29.460]  I plug into it. I'm only allowed to listen to break and lunch, but I take advantage of
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:33.500]  that. And I can't even tell you how many people that have woken up there, I'd have to sit
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:37.180]  there and try to tally it out. But at first they kind of laugh, so go, what are you listening
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:41.980]  to? And then pretty soon they're intrigued and they listen. So that's my point there.
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:46.660]  Work is a good advantage on your break time, freedom of speech.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:54.100]  Second point is with, say, in America is gone. Both my parents are gone, bless their souls.
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:58.580]  And I can plaster their picture in every room all over every wall, and that doesn't bring
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:03.020]  them back. But I can believe in their idea, and I can revive that and make that relevant.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:09.260]  Well, that's how you honor your ancestors is by being a person that stands up against
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:14.460]  evil. I mean, that's why they say honor your forebearers, honor your family name. I mean,
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:20.500]  it's so simple. That's all we've got. And that's so valuable. And sell all that out
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:24.820]  for some plastic Hollywood crud, this fake culture?
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:32.660]  Exactly. And I miss them dearly, just like I do miss America. But I can keep them around,
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:37.700]  I can revive them, I can revive the idea, just like you said. It is that easy. And my
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:42.740]  question is, explain to people the delegates and the whole voting process, because I think
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:47.460]  everybody gets nervous and scared, nope, Romney won New Hampshire, it's over.
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:52.540]  No, Ron Paul, especially if he has such a big ground force, can actually get even more
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:58.660]  delegates than even what his percentage showed. And he did that in Iowa, too. And people got
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:02.380]  to go, they've got to be involved, and they've got to be delegates. That way, when they try
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:10.980]  to steal it from Ron Paul or whatever, coming up at the convention, Ron Paul people can
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.140]  basically do a lot of things.
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:16.900]  They could force Ron Paul onto the VP. He probably wouldn't do that with somebody like
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:21.700]  Romney, and Romney wouldn't do that. And I mean, who knows what could happen? They keep
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:28.700]  telling us he can't win, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So that, well, we just expect he
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:35.220]  can. But we see that we're on the verge of breaking that hoax right now. And if we can
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:40.780]  make the hoax fully fall, we've blown big holes in it, but it hadn't fallen completely.
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:45.820]  It will then boomerang and backfire like Judo on The Globalist, and we'll send Ron Paul
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:52.900]  over the top. All right, we'll be right back with more of your phone calls. And we've got
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:51:22.500]  a guest come up in about 15 minutes. Stay with us.
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:44.240]  Hey, everybody.

[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:16.560]  for 35 years or so has been trying to wake people up about liberty then he got

[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:06.320]  the government's passing laws saying it can arrest us and throw away the key
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:13.360]  that just proves they're a bunch of crooks it shouldn't scare us because we
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:19.320]  already knew they were crooks they're just making sure and confessing publicly
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:24.720]  confessing you should be afraid of not facing them down and getting people

[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:57.520]  the stands but there's a fraction of that on the floor
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.200]  okay
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:07.320]  so I'm gonna say it again folks engage get involved that's what it's going to
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.040]  take let's go to Gary in Ohio Gary you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.640]  thank you Alex what are you talking about let's get engaged let's do it
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.960]  right now people who study the New World Order understand there's different
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:24.400]  factions within New World Order and if you study them very deeply you
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.480]  understand there's one thing they can't lie about and that's dates you talked
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.680]  about al-qaeda being a Pentagon puppet before well if you look at the date
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:39.880]  al-qaeda was established August 11 1988 remember that number 11 because the two
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:44.600]  biggest attacks no cut is history what they're known for the attack on 9-11
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:51.000]  which around the world is known as 9-11 and an attack 911 days later in Madrid
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.280]  on 311 when you go around and you look at the New World Order you know notice
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:01.420]  they start planning attacks on certain days Alex and since you're born on the
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:06.280]  11th I'm sure you understand a little bit you know I don't I know that the
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:10.120]  global controllers are totally obsessed with in morality and they really believe
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:16.160]  in it I I don't spend my time in things like that one way or the other I mean I
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:20.440]  know they believe in it I know they think it's sacred geometry and all this
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.880]  stuff but there's also a lot of big dates where people think things are
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:29.500]  gonna happen and they don't but I know Madrid even came out in the Spanish
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:34.200]  papers was a government operation they were running a anti-terror drill it
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.520]  turned out it was the cops that did it and then they blew up some patsies in a
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:43.440]  building to blame it on them I know 7-7 the head guy was mi6 who was running the
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:47.520]  patsies it appears they were part of a drill some of them escapes they were
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:51.840]  shot at Canary Wharf that all came out in the news but was buried the British
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:55.200]  government actually arrested the guy that made a video about it exposing it
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.480]  incredible but actually went over to London right after it happened to cover
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:05.640]  it we covered my film Terror Storm but that's basically it I mean on the issue
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:11.280]  of dates I just look at the facts of the case versus what dates they do it I mean
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:19.280]  look at seven seven three eleven nine eleven you're right anything else
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:24.640]  there's different days doing it if you look at like not just 11 to 29 people
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.480]  sign equals 11 that's the day they crashed the federal Wall Street on 10 29
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:34.640]  1929 if you look at last year on your birthday they ousted Mubarak on to 11
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:38.680]  and that the power to Mubarak stay there we'll come back and talk about on the
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:51.660]  other side you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today this is Alex
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:55.280]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:59.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:03.800]  bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.800]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:12.120]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:16.500]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:20.200]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:28.040]  families lose their power from weather related on edges number five a solar
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.160]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:40.080]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.my solar
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:44.600]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:55.280]  Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1 8 7 7 3 2 7 0 3 6 5 waging war on
[01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:01.240]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:12.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:20.520]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:28.080]  Alex Jones all right Stuart Rhodes is coming up as a constitutional lawyer to
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:33.680]  look at the fact that you can't legalize tyranny look at the NDAA Ron Paul and
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:39.800]  more will continue with your calls Gary in Ohio finishing up with you yes I know
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.440]  going back to the Babylonians Egyptians you name it they are obsessed with
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:49.080]  numerology and you're certainly right about that but you were you were going
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.680]  over the number 11 itself well insert factions within the New World Order
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:57.280]  they're very obsessed with doing things on certain dates because they understand
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.680]  11 deals with vibrational energy now and it deals with emotional energy you are
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:06.360]  an emotional person you're born on the 11th they do things on the 11th 29 to
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:09.880]  plus 9 equals 11 because they get emotional reaction out of people goes
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.160]  very deep now let me get you know a little bit about history so let me just
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:19.680]  give you the story on 11 11 at exactly 11 o'clock the Great War ended they made
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:23.960]  sure it ended it on 11 11 at exactly 11 o'clock because you can't have peace on
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:28.480]  11 not possible if you're in the numerology to understand this but here's
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.780]  how the story goes from that peace treaty there was a country created
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:37.720]  called the Second Republic of Poland it was created on 11 11 what country was
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:44.180]  used to start World War two Poland all of them exactly when the Russians and
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:49.240]  the Nazis invaded now we're looking at World War three of Iran interesting
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:57.200]  enough Iran an Islamic Republic was created on your birthday Alex to 11 you
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:03.320]  see how they put all the connecting pieces into place JFK he tried to break
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:10.000]  the back of the Federal Reserve on 6 4 1963 if you add up the dates 6 4 1 9 6
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.400]  3 out of the 29 2 plus 9 equals 11 he signed executive order 11 11 that day
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.080]  1 1 1 1 0 he waited to that date of signing because he was trying to use
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.840]  numerology to break the Federal Reserve back and by the way JFK was born on the
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:31.160]  29th 2 plus 9 equals 11 we can go into politics about this Barack Obama born 8
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:37.920]  4 1961 8 4 1 9 6 1 adds up the 29 2 plus 9 equals 11 look at all the people from
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:45.360]  the Democratic side Bill Clinton born 8 19 1946 add everything up 38 3 & 8 11
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:50.680]  John McCain born on the 29th Sarah Palin born on the 11th you see how they picked
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:58.000]  their puppets yeah how are they using numerology if they just so happen to be
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.440]  born on day I guarantee you I wasn't involved in any conspiracy people who
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:08.160]  are born on the 11th and the 29th and our 11 they have a certain level of
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:15.840]  charisma about them like you I'm not trying to laugh at you it's just that
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.640]  the elite I know we're really into numerology and and I probably should
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.240]  study it more before I laugh it's just it's just it's just I mean if this is
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.880]  true then the people running things are just out of their minds but I know that
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:35.000]  they they make movies about what they're gonna do before they do it take Fox TV
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.360]  had basically the exact same thing that really happened on 9-eleven on TV six
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.400]  months before where the government hijacks a jet by remote control to
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.520]  blame it on al-qaeda to fly it into the World Trade Center to attack Afghanistan
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:53.800]  but they use a drill to make NORAD stand down and and and and I even talked to
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.320]  the host of the show and he said yeah the CIA approached us and would plant
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:03.240]  these plots on us and then the question is well why did they want people to know
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.320]  what they were gonna do before they did it and the answer is they're into it
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:12.800]  lesser magic they believe that if they tell you what they're gonna do before
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:17.600]  they do it that gives it like good who'd you or whatever when they really do it
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:21.760]  and it's just it's crazy but then people say well look they're in control at me
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.600]  there must be something to it it's just that I know they're into all this stuff
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.720]  I just don't spend a lot of time looking into it because it's a riddle wrapped in
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:36.760]  an enigma wrapped in a McDonald's cheeseburger package I mean I I just
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:40.840]  don't know where it's going or what to do I mean it just it just it just gives
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:46.720]  me a headache it's just huh oh man I'm not really a very superstitious person
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:51.920]  but I don't open umbrellas inside I don't walk under ladders I put my
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:05:01.000]  horseshoes you know feet standing up and I do knock on wood why do I do that

[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:12.040]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:16.160]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home tremendous influence
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:21.000]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.040]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:30.960]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:35.280]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:39.120]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:43.080]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:48.720]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:54.720]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars calm or

[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.000]  is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.680]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:12.320]  real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:15.880]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:19.800]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:24.360]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:29.280]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:32.800]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:36.640]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:41.240]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot-com
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:45.600]  that's survival seed bank dot-com or give them a call at eight seven seven
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:50.520]  three two seven zero three six five that's eight seven seven three two seven
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:56.160]  zero three six five remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:08:02.720]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank com he's the
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:09.440]  t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:15.160]  all right I still haven't gotten to it but it's the video about Los Angeles a
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:22.280]  sheriff's deputy punching a now on record a mentally handicapped woman
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:27.760]  because she dared say oh you're the big man telling me get off the bus and
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:33.080]  people said she got on was very polite didn't do anything wrong so now beating
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:36.720]  up bag ladies is what's going on and the cop comes over and gets in the guy's
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:41.680]  face who's videotaping it and again this just illustrates how this has become the
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:45.840]  norm and people watch this around the world even in third world countries
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.920]  where their police don't act like this and say what's happened to America the
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.440]  question is what happened to the American people to just put up with this
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.840]  now Stuart Rhodes heads up Oath Keepers he's a constitutional lawyer worked in
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:04.280]  Ron Paul's a staff as well and of course former army veteran a paratrooper who
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:08.400]  was retired out of the military in a parachuting an accident and he wrote his
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.480]  thesis in college on the history of basically military dictatorships and
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:18.840]  America's role and and history in that with Lincoln and Stanton and what what
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:24.360]  brought about posse commentatis so we're gonna be discussing that history and now
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:29.820]  how it ties into NDAA but then I will before he leaves I promise we'll get to
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:38.720]  Rob and Sean and many others that are listening on stations like WJ OC 1490
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:46.000]  a.m. in Tennessee we'll talk to Sean and others that are holding and I do have
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.560]  some other news I want to get to as well but to give us a condensed history of it
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:52.760]  because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it Stuart Rhodes
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:59.720]  joins us I thought that I would add one more point to this too I shot a video
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:05.560]  but you can simply search the term for it NDAA is a hoax you cannot legalize
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:12.140]  tyranny now tyrants can criminally carry it out if not resistant both through
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:20.360]  information warfare the truth and physically if you if your backs against
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.740]  the wall I mean Hitler didn't have really the legal standing to go into
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:28.160]  Poland but he did we're going to France but he did because he had people that
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.360]  would follow his criminal orders same thing with the redcoats same thing with
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:37.760]  a white abolitionist who were hung by the hundreds for trying to free black
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.600]  slaves their argument was as a Christian I don't believe that these people are
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.000]  animals and I think they're free souls and should be free they call them kooks
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.440]  and nuts and lunatics but in the end their sacrifice came out on top and
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:54.920]  that's what scares evil that's why I always want you to think it's invincible
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:00.440]  and so they might try to carry out secret arrest of citizens disappearing
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:06.340]  us into black sites black holes but it only convicts the establishment is just
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:10.440]  as bad as we thought they were and verifies everything we've said and
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.320]  they're basically tattling on themselves they're confessing in their hubris in
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:19.800]  their attempt to intimidate people they've gone from just lying about New
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:24.560]  World Order to going yeah you bet uh-huh we're spying on Patriots yeah we'll
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:27.920]  arrest you yeah we're getting ready for some new terror attacks we're gonna
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.800]  blame on you I mean Democrats are putting out all these policy reports
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:34.920]  saying G Oklahoma sure helped us a new one's coming and we're gonna arrest
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:40.880]  everybody I mean that's even on Fox News so now they've moved into kind of a
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:50.480]  cornered hissing mangy you know wolf in a corner snarling at us the problem is
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:54.680]  they've put us in a corner so there's no getting out of this without a fight the
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:58.800]  question is what type of fight will it be do we work extra hard now to educate
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.760]  police and military that will be the enforcers of this where the rubber
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:06.960]  meets the road or we just shoot our mouths off and pile up giant amounts of
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.640]  guns and just say well let them come get it I'd rather work as hard as I can to
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:16.720]  avert this and then if it comes our numbers are that much greater that's the
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:23.560]  only sensible course and so you cannot legalize tyranny it's very very simple
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.800]  and again he's founder and director of Oath Keepers service US Army paratrooper
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:30.760]  until disabled in a rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:35.680]  former firearms instructor former member of Ron Paul's DC staff Stewart currently
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.680]  writes the monthly enemy at the gates column or did for SWAT magazine he's a
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:45.160]  graduate of Yale Law School where his paper solving the puzzle of enemy
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.600]  combatant status won the Yale's Miller Prize for best paper mobile of rights
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:55.560]  and he also has taught at the US military history at Yale was a Yale
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:00.240]  research scholar and is also writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:06.240]  of war the American people which has now happened oathkeepers.org okay Stewart
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:12.360]  let's give people a snapshot of history but first let's get into my breakdown
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.280]  and any would you like to elaborate on that or anything to it whether you're
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:20.880]  correct that's that's the that's the response we have to have I mean we need
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.080]  to prepare for the very worst and so but on the way there like you said we have a
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:30.280]  very narrow wind of opportunity to raise the awareness of the American people and
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:35.480]  to do all we can through peaceful means and while we're doing that because the
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:40.400]  same way the founders did they exhausted all their peaceful means but they also
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:45.480]  rallied more people to the cause won more people over and and steal them up
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.960]  and harden them and got them ready for the confrontation and that's what we
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:55.240]  have to do both things and and so what I encourage people to do is go look at
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:58.840]  what Jefferson and Madison did in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:04.120]  in 1798 which were a gross violation of the First Amendment they did two things
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:08.280]  at the same time one they nullified went to the states and said you have an
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:13.440]  obligation to interpose and nullify you said anything contrary to the
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:18.680]  Constitution is null and void from inception it is not law it is nothing so
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:22.280]  that's the attitude we have to have we do not give it any recognition
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:28.240]  whatsoever you can say they passed an unconstitutional invalid statute but it
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:31.920]  is not lawful we do not recognize it that's what Jefferson and Madison did
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:36.280]  they didn't go to the federal courts and begged them to recognize that this was a
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.600]  gross violation of the First Amendment they went to the state legislature and
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:44.420]  said you have an obligation so they know they tried to bring in tyranny just a
[02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:47.960]  few years after our country got on its feet and the original founders got
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.360]  together and said lock and load we're gonna try to peacefully back them off
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:56.560]  but if they don't it's another war right within the Alien Sedition Acts
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:01.920]  criminalized speech you had a newspaper editors reporters and writers being
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.320]  arrested for criticizing the president John Adams the second president of the
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:11.160]  United States and the Federalists were doing this during the the kind of
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:16.880]  quasi-war with France so throughout history it's always during wartime that
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:21.280]  they try to convince you you must give up your liberty in the name of fighting
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:24.240]  the war and so the Federalists in the name of fighting the war against the
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:30.120]  French the undeclared war against the French tried to silence dissent and so
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.680]  Jefferson and Madison like I said they dated two things at once they said
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.420]  it's null and void for inception in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions the
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:42.440]  state stood up but they also started a whole new political party and they swept
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:47.880]  the Federalists out of office in what's now called the revolution of 1800 they
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:51.240]  you know Jefferson was elected president and they swept all the Federalists out
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:54.680]  of Congress and so that's what we need to do right now in response to this
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:16:01.000]  atrocious unconstitutional intolerable act this is our history repeats itself
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.760]  but we didn't have such fraud and modern mind control
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:07.920]  undoubtedly he'd be the presumptive nominee he would defeat Obama and and
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.760]  we would see a repeat we're just in worse states than our founders were yeah
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:18.600]  Ron Paul is is Jefferson there let me take off my oathkeeper hat for a second
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.080]  to say that as an individual I endorse Ron Paul as an individual veteran of
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:29.760]  combat arms and airborne as a legal scholar there is nobody else out there
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:34.440]  who is going to defend the Constitution like he will all the rest of them would
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:39.720]  have been just like McCain who wrote the ND double-a Obama has already committed
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:43.080]  treason he's killing American citizens he's declared himself an elected
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.840]  dictator essentially and the rest of them up there
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:51.000]  Romney Gingrich Santorum they'd all be the same so you know this is your
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.560]  Jefferson Ron Paul is the closest thing to a modern Jefferson there is he's like
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:00.880]  Jefferson reincarnate and if you don't vote for him you are you are furthering
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:06.240]  us on that road to having no choice but to fight for our freedom again isn't it
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:09.960]  curious as how many historians and scholars have noted that history repeats
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:15.040]  I mean it doesn't so much repeat as it rhymes who was it that said history
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:21.800]  rhymes that was Mark Twain I mean it really does go in these cycles well it
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:26.960]  does it's always warfare if you look at after the alien sedition acts they put
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.840]  that genie back in the bottle they have the peaceful revolution 1800 took care
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:34.920]  of it but then he came then came the Civil War and was in a civil war in the
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:39.560]  name again of national security that Lincoln became essentially an elected
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:45.400]  dictator he in prison newspaper editors he in prison congressman he even wrote
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:51.960]  an arrest warrant out for Chief Justice Taney when when he balked against his
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:56.280]  suspension of habeas corpus so you know he just decided to do whatever he wanted
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.360]  to do and all of his supporters in the Republican Party the original Republican
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:05.400]  Party were all for it and in the north this is this is the precedent this is
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:10.360]  the first time that the power of the president's commander-in-chief was used
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.920]  against the American people he claimed the authority much like Bush and Obama
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:20.480]  he claimed the authority to the apply the laws of war not just to the the
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.480]  breakaway southern states that had succeeded and become their own country
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:29.840]  he also applied laws of war to northerners and the Supreme Court in
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:35.880]  1866 and the ex parte Milligan case ruled that unconstitutional but that's
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.240]  a case that came after the war was over it doesn't matter though whenever
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.920]  they're taking over states today they always go back to what Lincoln did which
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:46.720]  in the north was undoubtedly classical tyranny man I understand the more
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:50.600]  sophisticated nuances of the British manipulating the south and all of it
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:55.120]  it's always a double game but but undoubtedly than Stanton after that and
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:00.240]  executing people extra judicially and in modern times they're pointing at that
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:04.800]  and saying they'll use it against us well exactly that they sweep under the
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:09.120]  rug the fact that the Supreme Court ruled all of that completely
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:14.160]  unconstitutional in ex parte Milligan in this case it was a case of a man who was
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:18.640]  accused of violent violating the laws of war he was a citizen of Indiana he was a
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.400]  civilian but he was accused of violating the laws of war and Lincoln had detained
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:27.440]  fifteen thousand American northerners under military jurisdiction and he had
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:32.320]  tried almost five thousand of them by military tribunal and this guy was one
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:38.080]  of those and so they said look the laws of war apply to him and therefore a
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:42.120]  military tribunal is all he's gonna get that was the argument of the government
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:46.840]  lawyers and in fact they said this so the Bill of Rights they said these in
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:51.560]  truth are all peace provisions of the Constitution and like all other
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:56.320]  conventional and legislative laws and enactments are silent amidst arms stay

[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:26.200]  window there's a scene you need to catch
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.400]  yeah sometimes Satan
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:41.720]  yeah the New World Order says they're doing all this to keep us safe but
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.720]  they're not doing that are they you know the Stewart looking at history and I
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:48.880]  want to continue here with you on the history then look what's happening with
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:54.280]  Ron Paul right now and take some calls but tyrants behave the same as well they
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:59.120]  always have to hire a bunch of people that will follow any order so then over
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:03.360]  a short period of time the very worst gravitate into the positions of power
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:09.040]  and so the tyranny degenerates quickly and always causes a rebellion against it
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:13.920]  because even the sheep are forced to stand up just for self-preservation so
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:20.920]  there's a a wild frenzy that ensues and we're now seeing just government getting
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:27.360]  crazier and wilder and more arrogant and frothing by the moment please continue
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.760]  you gotten up to the Civil War right in the in that case about the use of
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:38.080]  military tribunal against an American citizen in the north the court the
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:44.160]  Supreme Court 1866 the government lawyers argued the exact same thing
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:49.480]  we're hearing now they said by the Constitution as originally adopted no
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:55.560]  limitations were put upon the war making and war conducting powers of Congress
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:00.040]  and the president and then as a fallback they said finally if the military
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.600]  tribunal has no jurisdiction the petitioner may be held as a prisoner of
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:10.040]  war eating with arms the enemies of the United States and held under the
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.640]  authority of the United States until the war terminates which is exactly the
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:20.200]  argument that Bush made and Obama and now Congress in the NDAA the same
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.240]  argument that the powers of the commander-in-chief are unlimited yeah
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.640]  you've got such proof that somebody is aiding a foreign military put the proof
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:34.200]  up that's why we have trials oh no not only will we secretly arrest you will
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:38.120]  never even have a public trial and no one must know that we grabbed you I mean
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:43.000]  that that's open tyranny right there that's always the greatest threat well
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.680]  the Constitution mandates an article three section two that all crimes must
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:54.680]  be tried by jury and then article three section three defines the crime of
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:27:00.040]  treason and it defines it as making war against the United States or aiding its
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:04.880]  enemies that is the definition of treason and so today they're
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:10.360]  circumventing that trial requirement very plain text of the treason clause
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.120]  and they're circumventing the Bill of Rights just like the Lincoln
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:18.200]  administration but let's take that plain reading if you're waging war or aiding
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:22.520]  the enemies the Congress is pretty much globalist run they actually fit the
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:26.000]  original treason definition they're waging war against our Bill of Rights
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.800]  Constitution our free market our private property our sovereignty our borders
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:35.780]  they are the tyrants that don't just say that they are traitors they are
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:41.560]  treasonous exactly well they fit the the exact definition of treason making war
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.800]  against the American people they're asserting the power of the president to
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.660]  treat the American people exactly the same as if they were Iraq's we're
[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:52.600]  America I see these newscasts where the government's getting ready to deal with
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:57.340]  their main threat us the American people what we're the government we're the
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:04.000]  people Romans 13 we're the government render unto us it's our country I want
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.960]  to want to read you what the Supreme Court had to say in 1866 they rejected
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:14.280]  completely that argument they said even these provisions the Bill of Rights
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:19.080]  expressed in such plain English words that it would seem the ingenuity of man
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:24.520]  could not evade them are now after the lapse of more than 70 years sought to be
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:30.160]  avoided those great and good men foresaw that trouble its times would arise when
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:35.280]  rulers and people would become restive under restraint and seek by sharp and
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:41.560]  decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper and that the
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:46.480]  principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril unless established by
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:51.280]  irreparable law that's what the Bill of Rights is it's irreparable law they
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:56.280]  understood human nature they understood that people can be driven by fear to
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:01.200]  give up their freedom and that's why you have a Bill of Rights that leaves it out
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:04.920]  of the reach of the people even when they're afraid and it's the highest
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:10.640]  level nothing can abridge it because it only enshrines inherent organic rights
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:14.280]  that are unalienable that's right and the Constitution would never been
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:18.320]  ratified without the promise of the Bill of Rights and when you read the preamble
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:22.600]  to the Bill of Rights it tells you what its purpose is it is to prevent
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:28.520]  misconstruction it is to prevent abuse of powers granted in the Constitution
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:34.120]  and prevent misconstruction and yet they willfully misconstrue it yes they did it
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:38.280]  that back then they're doing it now the Congress and the president are in open
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:43.840]  treason by the very constitutional definition and of course they're engaged
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:49.000]  in other criminal activities like fast and furious they are the enemy of

[02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:28.200]  to have you back on for a whole other interview on this subject but let's
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:33.640]  continue with the history because these aren't just words we're saying here we
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:38.360]  have a government that is totally illegitimate and has been caught
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:43.920]  committing so many crimes it's it's dizzying for special interest profits
[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:49.600]  and now they're openly selling shutting down free speech on the web and and
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:55.040]  checkpoints and TSA checkpoints total federalization 10th 9th amendment
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:00.120]  violations they're not just eating around the edges now they are in full
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.080]  assault on the heart of every basic liberty not even our Constitution or
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:10.200]  Bill of Rights the you know the finest example of it they are burrowing into
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:15.080]  Magna Carta they are annihilating just common sense they are they are trying to
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:22.120]  manifest every even absurdist dystopic cartoonism of tyranny but but they're
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:26.400]  they're setting it up beside us while Liberty still is practiced in his
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:32.400]  ongoing and the two rails are now going towards a collision course that's right
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:37.640]  that they've created the second track exactly like was done in in Nazi Germany
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:42.960]  and Stalinist Russia and unfortunately during the Civil War in the United
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:48.040]  States and but the Supreme Court put that genie back in the bottle in 1866
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:53.200]  Lincoln opened the the let the genie loose of martial law you know use
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:58.440]  martial law the Supreme Court ruled this here's what they said no usage of war
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:04.920]  could sanction a military trial for any offense whatever of a citizen in civil
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:09.840]  life in no wise connected with the military service Congress could grant
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:14.280]  no such power and the honor of our national legislature be it said it has
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:20.240]  never been provoked by the state of the country even to attempt its exercise the
[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:25.520]  even in the Civil War the US Congress didn't apply didn't try to authorize
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.800]  military trial so the current Congress has gone even further than than what
[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:36.000]  they did during the Civil War so one of the court said one of the plainest
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.960]  constitutional provisions was therefore infringed when Milligan was tried by a
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:46.880]  court not ordained and established by Congress and not composed of judges
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:51.880]  appointed during good behavior in other words not an article three court not a
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.920]  jury trial and so and this is what happened then is precisely the same
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:02.080]  thing that's happening now and it's also exactly what the founders faced you look
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.040]  at the decoration of independence they list among the grievances is denial of
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.720]  jury trial and also the attempt to impose upon them endurance jurisdiction
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:16.680]  foreign to their Constitution and back then what Parliament had done is they
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:21.800]  passed statutes that expanded the jurisdiction of the Admiralty courts as
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.040]  a way to strip the colonists of their ancient right to jury trial the exact
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:30.840]  same thing is being done here again so what happens as the crooks who admittedly
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:33.440]  you know they get caught inside our trading so Congress says well it's
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:39.680]  legal for us to because we say so again another pure tyrant statement the pure
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:44.360]  the fuhrer precept that I'm the leader I can do whatever I want what happens as
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:49.440]  it becomes manifest that it is illegitimate it is fraudulent it's got a
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:55.480]  gaggle of criminals posing as media deceiving and dissembling the truth over
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:59.520]  the public they've seized the infrastructure they're accelerating the
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:03.680]  dismantling of the country they're demonizing Americans who actually know
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:08.240]  that they're the enemy and foreign and illegitimate and it's all hurtling
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:13.240]  towards confrontation and the enemy knows that we're now awake to them and
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:18.520]  instead of just being hubris filled is scrabbling quickly to try to man the
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:25.120]  parapets against us I mean as the economic collapse accelerates well they
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:29.760]  understand it's a two-way window like you've said for a long time it goes both
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.400]  ways at the two-way window they understand that the more extreme they
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:37.520]  get more illegitimate they get the more the curtains pull back and we see the
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:42.360]  little man behind the curtain we realize how illegitimate fraudulent he is and so
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:47.560]  they're taking the mask off but in many ways that's helping us the NDAA is a
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:51.880]  gift to the freedom movement and they were already claiming these powers both
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:57.360]  bush and obama already use these powers bush detained two american citizen
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:01.720]  jose padilla and yasir hamdi and obama to start killing american citizens so
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.960]  they're already doing it anyway so I like the fact that they were brazen
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:10.280]  enough to put it right there in black and white in a congressional statute
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:14.560]  because now it's waking americans up finally I mean I've been saying this for
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:18.160]  since 2001 I've been screaming about this and it was hard to get anybody to
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:21.880]  listen to it but now they understand that they are destroying the bill of
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:22.520]  rights
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:26.280]  it's not a conspiracy theory it's right in their face and so it's a tool for us
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:31.800]  to wake them up so but but getting back to the history will quick after that
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:37.840]  attempt to apply the laws of war after that usage was ruled unconstitutional by
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:44.840]  the Supreme Court in 1866 it was never used again until 1942 during World War
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:50.320]  II by FDR there were eight german saboteurs that came ashore one of them
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:55.240]  claimed to be a US citizen they were captured and tried by tribunal in the
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:02.280]  court in that case in ex parte quaran the same New Deal court that found it
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:06.040]  ok to and in turn the japanese-americans over a hundred thousand
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:10.480]  u.s. citizens the same court that gave FDR everything else he wanted in the New
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:17.920]  Deal unrestrained power they ruled that the citizenship of the saboteur was
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:18.920]  irrelevant
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:24.600]  they ruled that what counted so the court said was what he was accused of
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.160]  doing so because he was accused of violating the laws of war the court
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:33.280]  ruled that he would get a military tribunal rather than jury trial so they
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:40.600]  totally up turn the ex parte milligan decision 1866 they totally ignored the
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:44.800]  treason clause and violated the Constitution grossly and that is the
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:50.440]  precedent that after that was not used again until post 9-11 and that's the
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:51.320]  president
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:54.840]  ex parte quaran of the bush administration reached back to from
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:40:00.120]  1942 and grabbed it and said hey look we can do whatever we want even to American
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:04.600]  citizens but let's get to the heart of this we're told this is done to stop
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:08.600]  al-qaeda who's been given libya who's being used to attack iran all on record
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.080]  and when you get all the internal documents in the myak and Homeland
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:15.120]  Security reports and all the rest of it
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:19.600]  it's admitted as you know but for the audience who may be new listeners that
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.360]  it's all about conservatives libertarians Patriots Oath Keepers Ron
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:29.680]  Paul Bob Barr Alex Jones filmmakers it's clearly an attack on the American people
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:31.520]  and they're training the police for this
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:35.360]  none of it has to do with the end of the Arab terrorists that they were first
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:39.360]  selling so they always sell on an unpopular minority just like Hitler did
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:44.600]  then it's expanded onto everyone and it's just so transparent we've got to
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:48.920]  get that message out but in constitutionally obviously it's a 10th
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:51.360]  amendment 9th amendment is a jurisdiction and then it's a fourth
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.160]  amendment but all over the country now they're having federally run there's a
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:59.440]  new one of you read the fine print the Orange County Register is reporting on
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.400]  this we can put it on screen police use a roadblock to gather serial killer
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:08.520]  information in the last few months three homeless have been stabbed in a town so
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:13.120]  they go out on a highway and it shows video of it shut down the highway and
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:18.800]  ask people if they saw anything I mean this is completely random makes no sense
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:24.160]  and and it's the feds running and it turns out it's basically a TSA ice
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:28.800]  breaker of why they're setting up on constitutional checkpoints and that many
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:31.560]  other areas they even dispense with that they just actually just pull you out of
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:36.320]  your car and search it but I mean you can clearly see them testing the perch
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:41.680]  you can see them you know really trying oh the Army's here to help search your
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:46.920]  car for alcohol oh the Marines are here you know now we see the military on the
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:50.360]  streets I mean they're really and then that's the proof of the criminality is
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.880]  that they're doing it incrementally by design to acclimate everyone involved
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:00.160]  yeah exactly like like you said it was just like what they did in Nazi Germany
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.640]  the Reichstag fire decree was the reaction to the burning of the
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:08.000]  legislature and it was aimed supposedly aimed at the communists but then they
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.640]  immediately expanded it out from there to trade unionist and then the Jews and
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.320]  on down the line and the same thing is going to happen here is happening right
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:21.720]  now the demonization as you said is targeted at constitutionalist targeted
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:27.880]  at you know veterans targeted at constitutes and libertarians and one
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:31.800]  thing people need to understand is that there was a law review article written
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:37.960]  back in 1996 right after Oklahoma City where two lawyers argued that the laws
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:43.240]  of war should be used against McVeigh to try on by military tribunal and they
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:48.280]  also said that Clinton should use the laws of war against the militia movement
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:53.800]  and they cited to the ex parte Querin case from 1942 and they argued that it
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:58.960]  should be updated and used against terrorist suspects and so that is
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:04.280]  precisely what they argued and wanted is what has now been put in place first by
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:09.040]  the Bush administration and so the original idea of using the laws of war
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:15.120]  against terrorism was actually first thought of about it would be used
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:21.640]  against right-wing domestic terrorists and right-wing radicals that was the
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:27.240]  first proposed use during the Clinton administration but Clinton didn't do it
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:34.920]  but Bush then did what Clinton did not do he updated that extra old 1942 case
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:40.240]  and applied it to the so-called war on terror and so now what Clinton did not
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:45.640]  have it at his fingertips Bush put in place and now Obama has like the ring of
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:49.880]  power out of the Lord of the Rings it's right there on his desk whenever he
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:54.120]  wants to he can grab it and use it and and notice he went through all these
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:59.520]  different manipulations where oh he it didn't affect citizens but then it did
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:06.080]  affect citizens but don't worry we won't use it against citizens but oh he's
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:10.360]  gonna veto it so it's okay and then he does sign it I mean it's they're using
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.660]  laws of war against us where we're the enemy and it's all deception but look at
[02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:18.960]  this article police use roadblock to gather serial killer information if you
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:22.920]  scroll down to the video on the Orange County Register it shows a major highway
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:29.080]  shutdown and people pull up to FBI with clipboards demanding they answer
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:34.080]  questions I mean this is clearly just turning everything into the TSA and then
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:39.400]  they use an excuse to sell the public on it we're trying to get a serial killer
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:43.120]  no they're not they know full well this isn't how you find a serial killer I
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:47.920]  mean it's just all about them seizing the roads seizing the infrastructure and
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:51.680]  training us that they will stop us when they want and we will answer their
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:57.120]  questions when they want again this is an FBI that ships guns into Mexico to
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:02.840]  blame the Second Amendment this is a government that is terrorist I mean I
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:06.320]  don't know what else to say stirred what would you do if you just pull up to a
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:11.840]  checkpoint with the FBI out of their jurisdiction on a major highway in the
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:18.440]  middle of California in Orange County in Anaheim demanding to basically you know
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:22.680]  answer their ghoulish questions I mean it's just it's so sick these people are
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:25.680]  so sick and of course you have to you have to refuse we have to use civil
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:30.880]  disobedience and you have to nullify as individuals we have to start refusing
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.120]  and withdrawing our consent and something else again it's this idea that
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:39.240]  if anything could ever kill you we've got to have checkpoints there so oh my
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.320]  gosh three homeless have been stabbed to death here and so we'll just start
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:47.040]  shutting down the entire area and making you all prisoners I mean do people see
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:51.080]  this is the perfect excuse to take over everything at the military industrial
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:57.240]  complex is eating America right now well I think more Americans are waking up to
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:00.880]  the fact and and like I said that's that's what's good about this is the
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:07.160]  more they overstep and the more they do this the more it wakes us up but we have
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:14.840]  to if we wait too long to fix this then we will become acclimated it's a choice
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:20.360]  between becoming the fourth Reich you know are we 1934 Germany where they just
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:24.840]  quietly went along with it and and and sat down and shut up because they were
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:32.440]  afraid of being jailed or are we 1774 America in the spirit of 76 you know
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:36.240]  that's what we have to choose yeah let's expand on that I mean let's expand on
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:42.400]  that this is the entire acclamation program and they really want to get us
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:45.880]  ready for checkpoints everywhere so you're on a pickup list and you don't
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:49.560]  know and you pull up and they grab you and you disappear right and I want to
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:54.480]  warn the police and others I mean once it goes to this level you're not gonna
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:58.920]  have a very safe job I'll tell you right now and well you know I've talked to
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:04.320]  veterans already across the country and they all say the same thing they say
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:08.760]  well how do I know if I get pulled over by a police officer how do I know it's a
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:13.280]  normal police stop that is not some black bag thing they'll be turned over
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:17.120]  to the Department of Defense and taken off to Guantanamo and my answer now is
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:21.160]  well you know right now they probably won't do that but that's where we're
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:26.680]  headed and like you said once the first one is detained like that every other
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:30.680]  veteran every other American out there is gonna be like well hey I will not
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.440]  know I'm going to assume the worst and I'm going to resist and a lot of them
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:38.760]  already told me that that when that day comes and they see that they're actually
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.680]  in danger of being black bag they will not allow themselves to be handcuffed
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:47.120]  even by a police officer because they will not know because the government is
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:53.920]  legitimate I mean again look at these quotes almost every comment here on the
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:57.000]  Orange County and there's hundreds of them what a dumb idea really a roadblock
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  most people driving in Orange County have no clue who is actually sitting
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:04.960]  next to them in a vehicle let alone clues to whom you know some bum was
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:11.720]  hacked to death in a dirty riverbed miles away here's another one it goes on
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:15.920]  civil rights violation that sounds like Nazi checkpoint with regular citizens
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:19.680]  having no rights do our police really believe they have gathered this much
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:23.760]  power that they can just start doing this yeah their bosses who are criminals
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:28.600]  tell them to do this this is perch testing it goes on complete violation of
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:35.040]  Terry versus Ohio and here's a minion kudos to the special task force you're
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:40.200]  on you're out in the community trying to get things done good job guys she
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.360]  probably works in the county your ignorance of your rights could not be
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:48.480]  more complete terror management theory at its best and it just goes on with the
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:53.760]  comments almost no one buying any of this information it seems to me that
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:56.800]  they are stopping people with hope of raising revenue yeah they did do some
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:00.400]  arrest and sticker tickets while they were in it was all just a sickening
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.160]  excuse under federal ghoul control I guess the feds weren't busy shipping
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:08.000]  guns out little kids out of the country it goes on to say I do not think that
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.800]  they will uncover much stopping many people because they are in the area
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:17.280]  maybe I'm wrong is this even legal a random checkpoint to interview potential
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:22.280]  witnesses seriously no fourth amendment issues here that it just goes on and on
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:28.560]  and on and on and on and on and on and on the good news is Stewart we're not
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:34.200]  buying it are we no and more Americans across the country are not buying it and
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:39.640]  that's that's why we are different than the Germans that's why it will not go
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:46.040]  the same way as Germany is split into a dark tyranny with a little whimper we
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:50.360]  will not go that what about three million guns 1.5 million plus instant
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:53.680]  checks in the month of December alone breaking all records I mean there aren't
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:57.200]  even liberals anymore in this country that that know how to talk I mean
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:00.560]  so-called liberals are all buying weapons and everything I mean they're
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:04.400]  watching what was the new order think they've done Stewart every liberal I
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:09.880]  know is arming to the teeth and is waking up and we just had El Paso County Colorado
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:15.440]  pass a resolution against the NDAA nullifying it and that's what has to
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:19.840]  happen across the country and and in fact I'm going to a meeting this weekend
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:24.520]  in Topeka Kansas we're bringing legislators and activists in from all
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:28.480]  over the country and we're going to draft model resolutions and build on
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:33.200]  what was already done in El Paso County Colorado and spread the message of
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:37.840]  nullification the local level towns counties and states yeah it's happening
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:42.840]  and you know the feds can say well that that we nullify that no we nullify you
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:47.920]  you work for offshore banks you individually may not be a criminal but
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:51.760]  you work for a system that's run by criminals the heads of your
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:58.260]  organizations are mafia organized crime scum you are illegitimate and the
[02:50:58.260 --> 02:51:04.640]  Republic is rising we veto you hello I'm Alex Jones myself my family the

[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:15.960]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest but look at another one of these comments here on
[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:20.640]  the Orange County Register where they have giant fed run checkpoints searching
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:25.160]  and demanding answers from people about a serial killer miles away in some
[02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:31.720]  ravine stabbing homeless people weeks after one of the commenters Rick Moreno
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:37.460]  says if you have any information don't call you might get a he mentions local
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:43.340]  police you might get a better response calling Anaheim or the FBI I called the
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:47.320]  town more than three weeks ago with the video came out of the bank robbers
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:52.340]  asking for any information that someone might have I left three messages for two
[02:54:52.340 --> 02:54:57.380]  different detectives and never did they call me back or even a thank you even
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:55:01.960]  though my info was good now folks I've called the Homeland Security numbers on
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:05.960]  air they have on TV if there's terrorists no one ever calls you or if
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:09.840]  you say I know where terrorists are they're like okay name a number they
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:13.680]  never call you I mean I know that the heads of al-qaeda meet at the Pentagon I
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:17.760]  have all the documents and there's like mm-hmm even even if you just say I have
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.120]  information on terrorists they don't call you back it's all fake and they
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:26.440]  know it they know it Austin's got tens of millions of dollars in the last
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:30.840]  decade you know on million and a half dollar robots and they go out once a week
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:34.740]  and blow up a cardboard box on the highway and ninny and it's just all
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:39.720]  about milking us it's just a total scam and a state of fear all the criminal
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:44.920]  City Council robs everyone I'm sorry Stuart Rhodes comments on this well
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:49.240]  you're right it's it's it's like a disease like a cancer that has spread
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:54.960]  the pesticides and spread and it's the same thing the founders faced right a
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:00.440]  swarm of officers sent out to eat away at their substance I mean everything
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:06.040]  that we're experiencing the experience that's why we should call people who who
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:10.360]  want checkpoints and all that should be called loyalists and they should be
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:15.360]  given we should give them redcoats as gifts and that's their that's their bad
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:20.640]  because what they really are they have they have rejected the the Republic
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:25.360]  they've rejected the concept of freedom they want to live like a third-world
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:29.660]  dictatorship like North Korea they should just go there because and we
[02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:33.440]  should just call them what they are you know they're totalitarians they're
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:39.840]  they're loyalists they would have been perfectly at home being a Tory back in
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:46.160]  1775 and calling for the military's trial of the American colonists and the
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:50.420]  rebels and calling for the arrest of John Hancock and in Sam Adams and
[02:56:50.420 --> 02:56:54.480]  stuffing them away in a military brig so that's what they are or putting them on
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:58.160]  a prison ship to starve to death Robin Pennsylvania you're on the air go
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:04.360]  ahead very riveting very riveting discussion and I was happy to hold and
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:09.760]  listen through it like to get to my points very quickly Francis and Friends
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:15.780]  is a show normally hosted by Francis swagger Jimmy swagger its wife it's on
[02:57:15.780 --> 02:57:19.560]  the Sunlight Broadcasting Network and I happened to be listening over the web
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:25.360]  and yesterday Donnie swagger at her son was hosting and on the show he falsely
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.000]  proclaimed that Ron Paul is quote-unquote not a Christian and does not
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:34.640]  know the Lord Jesus Christ and characterized Ron Paul as anti-israel
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:40.800]  pro-muslim is that because Ron Paul doesn't visit low-rent prostitutes and
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:46.000]  today's show was just as bad with Donnie swagger characterizing dr. Paul as a
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.840]  fruitcake and an alien from another planet I don't know about all those guys
[02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:55.360]  but the whole system is attacking Ron Paul what does that tell you that's
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:59.360]  exactly right and I'd like to I'd like to say that I did my incremental part by
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:04.680]  posting these videos on YouTube under under the title Donnie swagger falsely
[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:08.960]  proclaims dr. Paul mata Christian and there was another instance where Francis
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:13.040]  swagger was hosting a show and she called you a traitor Alex wherein she
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:16.720]  said that she characterized you as a traitor for discussing America's
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:22.640]  problems with RT and basically equating of you going on RT with you traveling to
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:27.280]  Russia I know that's a neo-con outfit they've been another some other groups
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.200]  been calling for my arrest because I do British and French and Japanese TV I
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:34.120]  mean it's just they're just they're loyal as traitors and they don't want me
[02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:38.920]  talking about the Republic but whatever I haven't heard those little discredited
[02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:48.120]  people so good good for them thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com
[02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:54.680]  today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:59.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:03.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[02:59:03.360 --> 02:59:07.640]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:12.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:16.040]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:59:16.040 --> 02:59:20.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:59:20.600 --> 02:59:24.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:28.440]  families lose their power from weather related on edges number five a solar
[02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:32.560]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:35.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered my solution from
[02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:40.480]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.my solar
[02:59:40.480 --> 02:59:45.000]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:53.440]  Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1 877 3 2 7 0 3 6 5 coast-to-coast
[02:59:53.440 --> 03:00:09.400]  direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:14.240]  you know we're looking at how tyrants always operate Stewart and they always
[03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:18.800]  say people that are criticizing them work for a foreign power and they've
[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:23.320]  got to take your rights and clap you in irons because you're not a patriot but
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:27.560]  we're the people actually defending America and what made the country great
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:33.760]  and it's so simple we're fighting global banks that take over countries and then
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:38.400]  use false nationalism to play our countries off against each other what
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:43.640]  would you say to the last caller before I go to Sean no I've heard the same
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:47.520]  allegations made against you and also Ron Paul I mean Congressman Paul was a
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:51.640]  Christian I used to work with the man I used to work for him and I can tell you
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:57.120]  that that's you know he's a very principled pro-life Christian but he's a
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:01.480]  constitutionalist also and he stands on the Constitution and that's what all of
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:09.200]  these Roman 13s twisting obedient loyalist fake Christians don't like they
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:13.880]  want obedience they want submission absolute submission to the state that's
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:18.120]  why I was a really great book out right now by Chuck Baldwin on Romans 13 that I
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:22.080]  recommend we've had him on about it that's great so you need to read that's
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:26.040]  the that's the that's the antidote to all that nonsense but there are loyalists
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:31.280]  there are loyalists most these churches are 501 c3 and the feds tell them you
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:34.920]  promote our agenda or you're gonna lose it they have the clergy response teams I
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:38.400]  mean it's like in China the communists have a loyal church they allow to
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:43.520]  operate the same thing that's right that's right so you know the best way to
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:47.280]  best way to handle them is to boycott them like the founders did shun them
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:52.960]  boycotts them that's right I mean I see police now and I walk over in a
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:55.040]  restaurant whatever and I say how are you guys doing where you stand on the
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:58.120]  Constitution in the Republic they say well we stand with it I go good job and
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:01.560]  shake their hand but they act weird I go oh it's weird for a citizen to come over
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:04.680]  and talk to you you want to ask yourselves why you think that's weird
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:09.320]  you want to ask yourselves why why me the little slave talking he was weird
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:12.560]  how was America gotten so weird that we're not supposed to communicate with
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:17.840]  each other it's time to get out of your shells folks or be put in a cell time to
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:22.680]  get out of the shell or be put in a cell either hang together hang separate let's
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:27.240]  go ahead and go to Sean and Tennessee listening on wjoc 14 90 a.m. in
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:31.560]  Tennessee go ahead Alex I love your show I'm glad I finally get you here in
[03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:35.560]  Chattanooga we have so needed this kind of information for a very long time now
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:40.200]  I mean you are truly appreciated here for all you do on this program to fight
[03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:44.720]  these globalists thank you god bless you and and you're truly appreciated and I'm
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:48.360]  also a big supporter and regular listener to another one you might be
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:53.200]  very familiar with on GCN quite there with pastor butch Paul oh great guy need
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:57.400]  to get him on and he fights these exact same people you just mentioned the 501
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:02.280]  c3s and but I have a question if you don't mind I that relates to a super
[03:03:02.280 --> 03:03:07.480]  technology that the government uses to control the ionosphere and jet streams
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:13.800]  and weather patterns talking about harp yeah absolutely well I wonder is this
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:19.280]  thing technology used to possibly control people or political dissidents
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:22.720]  well yeah they wouldn't use the big antennas for that but they've got
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:26.800]  patented little small psychotronic things that they've used there's
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:31.320]  actually been treaties on that with a euro the US and Russia not to use it
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:37.060]  from 1979 Stewart you want to get into any of the secret of weapons that you've
[03:03:37.060 --> 03:03:41.440]  read about or anything I mean all I know I really know about is the same thing
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:46.540]  you've heard about I don't know much beyond that yeah and you know a lot of
[03:03:46.540 --> 03:03:50.680]  these super high-tech weapons and stuff it's all just bravada it's all a system
[03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:55.120]  trying to look the people that win wars are the people that don't stop fighting
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:59.600]  and who have right on their side okay tyrants never succeed when people stand
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:04.440]  up against them take Gandhi he spent 30 years just getting the Indians to have
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:08.080]  respect for themselves and learn to stand up and when they stood up there
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:11.320]  was nothing the British Empire could do closing comments on that Stewart Rhodes
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:15.320]  thank you so much Sean well that's absolutely correct I mean I mean that's
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:20.120]  the that's the great secret that they don't want you to realize the truth is
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:25.480]  that you are in the end you hold all the power in your hands and and and you
[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:28.680]  includes the military and police and that's why I started with keepers
[03:04:28.680 --> 03:04:31.920]  because they can't do it without them and so that's what we should look
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:36.040]  towards what happened in 1989 in East Germany like Gunter Spence talked about
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:40.920]  on your show a mass stand down and a mass stand up by the people you know
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:44.040]  what Stewart I've already got a guest on the nightly news tonight but we might
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:47.920]  want to either today or tomorrow tape more about the police and the military's
