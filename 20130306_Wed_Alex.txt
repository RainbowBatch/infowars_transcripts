[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:27.080]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.800]  Welcome to the broadcast. This is the Alex Jones Show. Mike Adams, the Health Ranger,
[00:31.800 --> 00:42.280]  sitting in for Alex today on this Wednesday, March 6th, 2013. Yes, Hugo Chavez is dead.
[00:42.280 --> 00:47.900]  At least his physical body is dead. His soul is no doubt rotting someplace where he's inhaling
[00:47.900 --> 00:52.000]  a lot of sulfur right now. And we're going to be talking about that on the show today,
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.360]  of course. Plus, we're hoping to get Max here in the studio. He's an Infowars employee from
[00:58.360 --> 01:05.360]  Venezuela to give us some really well-informed perspective on the death of Chavez.
[01:05.360 --> 01:11.560]  And I know in America everybody says Chavez, but in South America it's Chavez. So that's
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.160]  the pronunciation I'm going with. But anyway, there are a lot of implications for this and
[01:16.160 --> 01:22.400]  there are a lot of parallels to what is happening in America today, parallel to what Chavez
[01:22.400 --> 01:28.560]  did to Venezuela since, what, 1998. So we're gonna talk about those parallels and how the
[01:28.560 --> 01:36.680]  American economy has been invaded with a cancer in the same way that Chavez, his body was
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.480]  invaded with cancer and how socialism is a cancer.
[01:41.480 --> 01:45.980]  And in addition to that, we got a lot of great guests coming up today. Now, the guest segments
[01:45.980 --> 01:51.480]  are gonna be relatively short because we got so much news coming in. And in the third hour,
[01:51.480 --> 01:57.040]  we've got two special reports and some interesting dialogue with Infowarriors David Knight and
[01:57.040 --> 01:59.960]  Aaron Dykes, who will be in studio with me here.
[01:59.960 --> 02:05.120]  That's the third hour. Before then, we've got Liz Reitzig with an update on the raw
[02:05.120 --> 02:10.760]  milk public debate in Maryland. Just a quick update from her at the bottom of this hour.
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.960]  We've got James Stewart popping in with a success story of entrepreneurial victory versus
[02:16.960 --> 02:24.040]  state tyranny. He is the raw milk man from California that they threw in jail for selling
[02:24.040 --> 02:29.680]  fresh milk, or actually not even selling it, just distributing it at a pickup point in
[02:29.680 --> 02:31.400]  Los Angeles.
[02:31.400 --> 02:35.680]  And he has found a way to achieve victory against that tyranny. We'll have him on at
[02:35.680 --> 02:40.360]  the top of the next hour. We've also got Dr. Len Saputo joining us for some updates about
[02:40.360 --> 02:48.040]  vaccine damage of babies and why the system wants you to inject your children with mercury,
[02:48.040 --> 02:55.160]  formaldehyde, MSG, and aluminum. It's all in vaccines admitted by the CDC.
[02:55.160 --> 03:01.960]  So all of that news coming up today, plus, check this out. This is huge news. Paul Joseph
[03:01.960 --> 03:10.720]  Watson story up on infowars.com right now. Media portrays DHS ammo purchases as a conspiracy
[03:10.720 --> 03:18.480]  theory. Yeah, no, DHS isn't buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammo, or I think it's up to 2 billion
[03:18.480 --> 03:19.480]  now.
[03:19.480 --> 03:27.200]  No, no, DHS isn't buying 7,000 full auto assault rifles, as we already wrote about and exposed
[03:27.200 --> 03:35.160]  from their public bids. And no, according to media matters, DHS isn't even buying 2,700
[03:35.160 --> 03:41.320]  plus armored assault vehicles to be deployed on the streets of America. No, this is all
[03:41.320 --> 03:43.760]  just imaginary.
[03:43.760 --> 03:49.560]  It's all imaginary. There are no bullets. There are no guns. There are no assault vehicles.
[03:49.560 --> 03:57.680]  It's just purely a conspiracy theory. It's just your imagination. And I'm relieved. I'm
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.400]  relieved because it means that we can all just buy imaginary bulletproof vests now to
[04:03.400 --> 04:09.200]  be safe so that all those on the radical left out there who think this is imaginary, when
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.680]  the bullets start flying your way, all you need is an imaginary ballistic vest.
[04:14.680 --> 04:20.480]  It will protect you. That's right. And when they round you up and throw you in the imaginary
[04:20.480 --> 04:28.400]  FEMA camp, you can imagine that you're somewhere else. You can imagine you're in an Obama mania
[04:28.400 --> 04:36.600]  utopia. How's that sound? Use your imagination. That's what it's there for. And I'm going
[04:36.600 --> 04:43.760]  to sell an imaginary preparedness course for the radical left so that you can imagine that
[04:43.760 --> 04:45.120]  you're prepared.
[04:45.120 --> 04:50.440]  But not really. How's that sound? Imaginary preparedness course. Much more news straight
[04:50.440 --> 04:54.320]  ahead here on the Alex Jones show. Stay with us. We'll be right back with all this news
[04:54.320 --> 05:24.160]  and more.
[05:24.320 --> 05:51.680]  We'll be right back with all this news straight ahead here on the Alex Jones show.
[05:51.680 --> 06:08.440]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[06:08.440 --> 06:14.520]  Ben Soap Company. Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years. These

[06:50.640 --> 07:02.240]  or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog. A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot
[07:02.240 --> 07:06.880]  of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[07:06.880 --> 07:11.840]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.000]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.680]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[07:21.680 --> 07:27.440]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin
[07:27.440 --> 07:32.360]  and mineral company out there and discovered Younggevity. The Younggevity products are
[07:32.360 --> 07:36.940]  designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have
[07:36.940 --> 07:43.480]  to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the
[07:43.480 --> 07:49.280]  vitamins and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself, it's incredible. Go to Infowarsteam.com
[07:49.280 --> 07:54.940]  today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine complete multivitamin mineral
[07:54.940 --> 08:14.400]  complex dietary supplement. That's Infowarsteam.com. Big Brother, mainstream media, government
[08:14.400 --> 08:22.600]  cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[08:22.600 --> 08:25.480]  it's Alex Jones.
[08:25.480 --> 08:29.760]  All right, this is the Alex Jones show. Thank you for joining us today. This is Mike Adams
[08:29.760 --> 08:36.860]  filling in for Alex who has the week off, but he's calling all of us and filling us
[08:36.860 --> 08:42.000]  in and filming videos. In fact, he shot a video last night on the death of Hugo Chavez
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.560]  and that's up at Infowars.com, so check out that video. Obviously, we're going to be covering
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.480]  the death of Chavez here today, so if you're interested in that, stay tuned. We're going
[08:52.480 --> 08:54.720]  to try to get Max in the studio here.
[08:54.720 --> 09:02.840]  Max is an Infowars employee who is from Venezuela to get some in-depth perspective on that issue.
[09:02.840 --> 09:10.960]  But as I wrote last night, Hugo Chavez, even though he is dead, the great cancer of socialism
[09:10.960 --> 09:17.960]  continues to spread. So this is the really sad thing, not that Chavez is dead. That's
[09:17.960 --> 09:23.400]  probably something worthy of a celebration for all who believe in human rights and liberties
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.960]  and justice in Venezuela.
[09:25.960 --> 09:33.640]  The real issue is that his philosophies continue to spread like a cancer tumor. And his philosophies,
[09:33.640 --> 09:39.120]  which are, of course, centralized control, total government corruption, government taking
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.840]  over private industry, no more private ownership of businesses, all of this incredible corruption,
[09:45.840 --> 09:51.880]  incredible poverty, incredible centralized command control economy. That philosophy is
[09:51.880 --> 09:56.840]  now invading America. Well, it has been for many years, and we'll talk about that in more
[09:56.840 --> 09:57.840]  detail here on the show.
[09:57.840 --> 10:01.320]  But let me give you the rundown of what's coming up here for the next three hours here
[10:01.320 --> 10:08.960]  on the Alex Jones show. We've got Liz Reitzig popping in for a few minutes with a live update.
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.800]  She's about to give testimony in the state of Maryland on raw milk freedom, food freedom
[10:13.800 --> 10:17.520]  issue there. She's gonna give us a quick update of what's happening. We've got James Stewart
[10:17.520 --> 10:24.480]  popping in from California on his entrepreneurial victory against the state tyranny there.
[10:24.480 --> 10:28.840]  They tried to shut him down for selling farm fresh milk. Now, this whole show isn't about
[10:28.840 --> 10:34.480]  food, by the way, but those two just happen to coincide today. We've got Dr. Len Saputo
[10:34.480 --> 10:39.360]  joining us to talk about GMOs and vaccine damaged babies and how the system wants you
[10:39.360 --> 10:46.760]  to keep injecting your babies with lobotomizing heavy metals, including mercury.
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.160]  And of course, there's also MSG and formaldehyde in those vaccines. And then in the third hour,
[10:52.160 --> 10:57.240]  sort of the bonus round here on the show, we've got David Knight joining us at one o'clock
[10:57.240 --> 11:04.080]  with some special reports and also Aaron Dykes jumping in at 1.30. So it's a packed show.
[11:04.080 --> 11:11.000]  I'm gonna try to take some calls during the Len Saputo segment that's at 12.30 Central.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.200]  So I'll open up the phones at that point for some calls. But until then, we're just gonna
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.800]  run down the breaking news. Now, we're waiting on Max to get in here to give us a breakdown
[11:20.800 --> 11:21.800]  on Chavez.
[11:21.800 --> 11:27.480]  So I'm gonna save the Hugo Chavez story for later. Let's go to this story right now, which
[11:27.480 --> 11:32.320]  I mentioned before the break, but not all stations carry that. Paul Joseph Watson has
[11:32.320 --> 11:39.840]  a blockbuster news story on infowars.com. Media portrays DHS ammo purchases as conspiracy
[11:39.840 --> 11:46.760]  theory. This is, of course, from Media Matters, which is just an Obama administration mouthpiece.
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.360]  Now, here's the deal. If you're a regular listener of this show, you know that the federal
[11:52.360 --> 11:58.240]  government has purchased over 1.6 billion rounds of ammo. They're stockpiling ammo like
[11:58.240 --> 12:03.880]  never before. It's an arms race. It's actually up to 2 billion if you're keeping track. And
[12:03.880 --> 12:13.040]  we've shown you the documents from the bid contracts with the actual numbers right there.
[12:13.040 --> 12:19.240]  It's all out in the open. We've shown you that DHS is purchasing 7,000 full auto assault
[12:19.240 --> 12:25.200]  rifles as well. And it calls them personal defense weapons, by the way. That's interesting.
[12:25.200 --> 12:32.480]  We've shown you, and more recently, that DHS is retrofitting 2,700 armored vehicles. These
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.920]  are really armored assault vehicles. They're not tanks, because they don't have a turret,
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.720]  but they're armored vehicles for moving assault teams around. And they are to be deployed
[12:44.720 --> 12:50.460]  in the United States on the streets of America. Now, the liberal media, well, I guess liberal
[12:50.460 --> 12:58.160]  is even the wrong word. It's the radical left media, the White House controlled media, says
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.960]  that all of this is made up. That it's a complete conspiracy theory. The Associated Press even
[13:02.960 --> 13:08.640]  did a story on this, which just said that the bullet buys are a conspiracy or that it's
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.440]  misleading and they don't give any reason why. Or they say, well, yeah, they're buying
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.640]  the bullets, but the government just wants to save money. You don't save money buying
[13:18.640 --> 13:20.680]  things that you don't need, okay?
[13:20.680 --> 13:26.580]  So if they're buying all of this, they intend to use it. There's a lot of ammo, 1.6 billion
[13:26.580 --> 13:32.000]  rounds or 2 billion now, thousands of assault rifles, thousands of assault vehicles, and
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.520]  this is just the stuff we know about. Imagine the stuff that we don't know about. But the
[13:36.520 --> 13:42.920]  left says this is all imaginary. So as I was joking before the break there, wow, that makes
[13:42.920 --> 13:48.240]  our job very simple, very easy to prepare, since I guess all of this is imaginary.
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.400]  We could just, to defend against, you know, imaginary tyranny, we could just buy imaginary
[13:53.400 --> 13:58.240]  ballistic vests. Wouldn't that be great? Or if you want to grow your own food, you could
[13:58.240 --> 14:05.280]  buy imaginary seeds. Or how about imaginary food for your food preparedness? And I was
[14:05.280 --> 14:11.880]  even thinking, I should produce a how to imagine you're prepared course. How about that? How
[14:11.880 --> 14:19.000]  to imagine that you're prepared for anything and it doesn't cost you a dime to gather all
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.040]  this stuff because it's all imaginary.
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.980]  And so when the government breaks out its imaginary ammo and its imaginary guns and
[14:25.980 --> 14:31.020]  comes into your town, rolls in with its imaginary assault vehicles, you can whip out your imaginary
[14:31.020 --> 14:36.720]  defenses and you can grow food with your imaginary seeds. And after you take the course, if a
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.920]  friend asks you, are you prepared? You can say, I imagine I am. Yes, yes, indeed. I imagine
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.620]  I'm fully prepared against all the imaginary stuff.
[14:45.620 --> 14:52.440]  But obviously, this is all very real. Hardware is real, bullets are real, lead, you know,
[14:52.440 --> 14:59.080]  I checked. Lead is on the table of elements. It's actually an element. It's as physical
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.060]  as it gets in this reality. So in fact, lead is quite dense and if it's headed your way,
[15:05.060 --> 15:08.280]  you don't want to just imagine that you're moving out of the way.
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.280]  You want to get out of the way, you want to get prepared. So to all of those on the left
[15:13.280 --> 15:20.140]  who are lying to you and saying that this is all imaginary, I can only say, I hope your
[15:20.140 --> 15:27.760]  imagination continues to work when the bullets are aimed at you. Because that's where this
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.960]  is all headed and we'll talk about Chavez and we'll talk about Stalin and Mao and Hitler
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.620]  and the history of tyrants throughout human history who have always inevitably tried to
[15:38.620 --> 15:44.480]  control power and try to dominate their people using weapons, weapons that are very real,
[15:44.480 --> 15:45.940]  hardware that is very real.
[15:45.940 --> 15:51.500]  It is not imaginary. It is not delusional. It is not a conspiracy theory. This is human
[15:51.500 --> 15:58.600]  history repeating itself. Why is the government arming up? It's not my imagination to tell
[15:58.600 --> 16:04.440]  you it's because the government anticipates needing to deploy that hardware on the streets
[16:04.440 --> 16:11.640]  of America. There you go. God forbid the Associated Press actually would tell the truth and say
[16:11.640 --> 16:13.080]  such a thing.
[16:13.080 --> 16:18.920]  Anyway, check out that story on Infowars.com. Let's go to some other news, other breaking
[16:18.920 --> 16:25.520]  news. Will you be required to turn in your guns to receive healthcare in America? This
[16:25.520 --> 16:31.720]  is a story from yesterday. A state rep says that you might have to surrender your guns
[16:31.720 --> 16:38.760]  for Obamacare. This is another story by Paul Joseph Watson. And let's see, I'm not catching
[16:38.760 --> 16:40.820]  what state he is from, Montana.
[16:40.820 --> 16:46.560]  Here it is, Montana lawmaker Creighton Kerns warns that when he's trying to pass a bill
[16:46.560 --> 16:51.020]  that would prevent a healthcare provider from refusing service to a person who refuses to
[16:51.020 --> 16:55.980]  provide information about their firearms ownership, cuz this is where this was headed. Someday
[16:55.980 --> 17:01.200]  in the future, you go into the hospital, you need treatment, you had an accident, a car
[17:01.200 --> 17:03.760]  accident, a broken bone, an infection, whatever.
[17:03.760 --> 17:09.440]  And they say, yeah, we'll treat you. But you gotta turn in your Ruger. You gotta turn in
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.920]  your Remington. You gotta bring your bullets. And at that point, I guess you could tell
[17:13.920 --> 17:19.020]  them, you can just hand over empty air and say, here's my imaginary bullets, cuz that's
[17:19.020 --> 17:22.560]  just like Department of Homeland Security, it's all imaginary.
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.360]  All my guns are imaginary, so here they are. And then they can then, in turn, give you
[17:26.360 --> 17:32.320]  imaginary healthcare, which is really what the whole system is, cuz it's not healthcare,
[17:32.320 --> 17:38.200]  it's disease management. They give you pharmaceuticals, and they get you to think, to imagine that
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.680]  you're getting a treatment, when in fact, you're just being poisoned by the pharmaceuticals.
[17:42.680 --> 17:48.240]  Think about it, vaccines are imaginary vaccines, because they don't protect you from the flu.
[17:48.240 --> 17:53.840]  In fact, I've got another story here today about how vaccines cause narcolepsy. Vaccines
[17:53.840 --> 18:02.000]  are imaginary medicine. It's even more fringe than the skeptics say homeopathy is. It's
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  so bizarre.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.840]  Anyway, there you go. If you want healthcare, you might be required to turn your guns. Check
[18:06.840 --> 18:13.540]  this out. Eric Holder, drone strikes against Americans on US soil are legal, he says. This
[18:13.540 --> 18:20.580]  is in response to a query from Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, of course. And in his letter answering
[18:20.580 --> 18:27.320]  Senator Paul, Eric Holder says that he thinks it's completely legal to have drone strikes
[18:27.320 --> 18:30.740]  against American citizens on US soil.
[18:30.740 --> 18:38.520]  And here's his language. He says, it is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance.
[18:38.520 --> 18:43.680]  Here he is imagining again. They really love all this imagining, don't they? To imagine
[18:43.680 --> 18:49.540]  a circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution, he
[18:49.540 --> 18:54.340]  says, what a joke, under the Constitution, of the United States for the president to
[18:54.340 --> 19:01.460]  authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States.
[19:01.460 --> 19:11.060]  You realize that there are at least five traitorous implications or statements in this statement
[19:11.060 --> 19:19.920]  from Eric Holder. I mean, this is grounds for being arrested for sedition against America.
[19:19.920 --> 19:25.440]  I mean, you can't use the military in the United States. The president alone cannot
[19:25.440 --> 19:31.860]  declare who to assassinate. This is not under the Constitution. I mean, this guy is off
[19:31.860 --> 19:38.040]  his rocker. But he says, he insists that you can use drone strikes against American citizens
[19:38.040 --> 19:39.040]  on US soil.
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.540]  That is now official. So all of those who made fun of Alex Jones saying they're gonna
[19:43.540 --> 19:48.460]  use drones to come after you in America, all of you media matters and people out there,
[19:48.460 --> 19:54.220]  you owe Alex Jones an apology. Eric Holder just said Alex Jones was right, all right?
[19:54.220 --> 20:01.120]  That's a fact. It's not my imagination. That's a fact. Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[24:23.020 --> 24:29.040]  for Alex thank you for continuing with us much more straight ahead I just can't believe
[24:29.040 --> 24:34.940]  that we live in a country where the Attorney General who is supposed to be the person who
[24:34.940 --> 24:45.060]  upholds the law the top law defender of the country says that the government that one
[24:45.060 --> 24:55.080]  man the president can decide to kill an unlimited number of American people on US soil with
[24:55.080 --> 25:04.780]  no due process no charges ever being levied against you no rights no no attorney not even
[25:04.780 --> 25:10.940]  a trial by jury man I mean it's you talk about wow you talk about tyranny this is the very
[25:10.940 --> 25:16.860]  definition of it that the Attorney General would say yeah we can kill anybody at any
[25:16.860 --> 25:20.660]  time for any reason and we don't need to tell you why we don't need to produce any evidence
[25:20.660 --> 25:26.900]  why that is is that not the definition of tyranny is that not a total criminal violation
[25:26.900 --> 25:32.780]  of the US Constitution is that not government gone completely awry I mean come on come on
[25:32.780 --> 25:40.180]  wake up people wake up and smell the tyranny in some other news some good news for a change
[25:40.180 --> 25:46.020]  check this out a military acupuncture is a big deal many of you have probably never heard
[25:46.020 --> 25:49.500]  of this but I've been tracking this because of course you know I'm the health Ranger I
[25:49.500 --> 25:55.220]  follow alternative health acupuncture you know you know how our soldiers are being killed
[25:55.220 --> 26:00.100]  by all of these SSR eyes and all these psychotropic drugs and they're committing suicide in huge
[26:00.100 --> 26:04.320]  numbers and their brains are being fried by these drugs and then they're being they're
[26:04.320 --> 26:10.020]  being diagnosed with PTSD and denied their rights when they come home well there's an
[26:10.020 --> 26:14.660]  alternative to that and it's acupuncture and a process called cupping which is actually
[26:14.660 --> 26:19.700]  part of traditional Chinese medicine cupping where they actually use little vacuum cups
[26:19.700 --> 26:24.700]  and they can pull toxins right out of the body through the skin it turns out that there's
[26:24.700 --> 26:29.980]  a military acupuncture is being tested here in Texas at some military bases and it's being
[26:29.980 --> 26:35.420]  used in a limited role on the battlefield right now and it works that's the amazing
[26:35.420 --> 26:41.620]  thing no side effects no drugs it doesn't cause psychosis it doesn't promote suicides
[26:41.620 --> 26:47.780]  it's it's virtually painless it's easy it's totally safe military acupuncture I want to
[26:47.780 --> 26:52.380]  just encourage you all to use this term to think about this this is the way to protect
[26:52.380 --> 26:57.740]  our soldiers treat them with medicine that doesn't cause them to commit suicide military
[26:57.740 --> 27:03.340]  acupuncture works and cupping works and there's another angle on all of this because rights
[27:03.340 --> 27:07.380]  of soldiers are being taken away now when they return back to the USA if they've ever
[27:07.380 --> 27:13.540]  been diagnosed with PTSD when soldiers are now facing any kind of counseling or even
[27:13.540 --> 27:20.620]  just talking to a doctor in the field soldiers are now refusing to talk about any symptoms
[27:20.620 --> 27:25.500]  any problems anything at all because they know they're going to be diagnosed with PTSD
[27:25.500 --> 27:29.500]  and stripped of their rights and I don't blame them if I was a soldier out there I would
[27:29.500 --> 27:35.980]  keep my lips sealed as well I'd keep my trap shut and would not say that oh I'm you know
[27:35.980 --> 27:39.800]  whatever they might be feeling out there if they have thoughts of anger whatever they
[27:39.800 --> 27:44.620]  have or aggression or regret or anything I wouldn't say anything either because they're
[27:44.620 --> 27:48.500]  going to put that on your record and they're going to use that to take away your rights
[27:48.500 --> 27:53.460]  your your firearms and who knows what else maybe your first amendment right someday so
[27:53.460 --> 27:58.800]  we got to treat our soldiers or active duty soldiers and our veterans better in this country
[27:58.800 --> 28:03.580]  and that means don't drug them up let's use things that actually work like military acupuncture
[28:03.580 --> 28:07.060]  that's something you probably never heard of but it's it's actually working so let's
[28:07.060 --> 28:12.060]  hope that continues to gain some steam throughout the military all right check this out freedom
[28:12.060 --> 28:18.580]  license plate is banned in Washington DC this is out of the examiner Washington the word
[28:18.580 --> 28:24.780]  freedom is on the list of banned vanity license plates because you can't have somebody driving
[28:24.780 --> 28:34.000]  around Washington DC with such a such profane obscenity on their car as the word freedom
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.340]  that's not allowed in the capital of this nation can't have the word freedom you also
[28:39.340 --> 28:46.140]  cannot have the word Ron Paul it's also banned according to this article so no freedom there
[28:46.140 --> 28:51.860]  is no freedom in Washington well we already knew that and Ron Paul is banned as a license
[28:51.860 --> 28:56.620]  plate I think we should give that license plate to Ron Paul like the domain name we
[28:56.620 --> 29:00.700]  should give Ron Paul Ron Paul.com I mean come on guys what's going on there give him the
[29:00.700 --> 29:06.700]  freaking domain it's his name give him we should all get together buy Ron Paul a new
[29:06.700 --> 29:11.980]  pickup truck and put Ron Paul on the license plate how's that he deserves it all right
[29:11.980 --> 29:19.660]  more bad news about nightmare bacteria from the CDC they are spreading the alarm on this

[35:11.220 --> 35:18.700]  phone live from the scene of where testimony is being given today in maryland is liz right
[35:18.700 --> 35:24.460]  zig she is of course one of the key leaders on the issue of raw milk freedom she was part
[35:24.460 --> 35:30.740]  of the raw milk freedom riders and has been engaged in a lot of activism on the side of
[35:30.740 --> 35:35.540]  food freedom and and milk choice freedom in america i can't even believe we we have to
[35:35.540 --> 35:41.580]  have this conversation but raw milk is continues to be illegal in most states so liz is joining
[35:41.580 --> 35:46.620]  us today she's about to give testimony liz welcome to the alex jones show hi mike thanks
[35:46.620 --> 35:49.860]  so much for having me on it's great to be here oh well thanks for joining us and thanks
[35:49.860 --> 35:53.800]  for keeping me posted and in the loop on all of this you're about to give testimony i've
[35:53.800 --> 35:57.900]  got a copy of it in my hands but give us the breakdown of what's going on there and what
[35:57.900 --> 36:06.100]  are you going to say well basically cow shares which is a valid way for people to obtain
[36:06.100 --> 36:10.820]  raw milk have been criminalized in maryland for the past seven or eight years and there
[36:10.820 --> 36:16.020]  is a bill in the legislature this session that would repeal that and reinstate cow shares
[36:16.020 --> 36:20.540]  in maryland and this is such a great option for people like me who live in the suburbs
[36:20.540 --> 36:25.100]  i can't get my own cow but i could get a cow and board it at a friend's farm and then get
[36:25.100 --> 36:29.660]  the milk from that animal so this if this bill goes through this is a great way to revitalize
[36:29.660 --> 36:35.560]  the maryland rural economies and get raw milk back to maryland consumers from maryland farmers
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.380]  well that's that's very important liz but i gotta ask you how could maryland have even
[36:39.380 --> 36:43.860]  outlawed cow shares in the first place doesn't every human being have the right to engage
[36:43.860 --> 36:47.660]  in a contract you can own a share of a condo you can own a share of a company that's called
[36:47.660 --> 36:52.020]  buying stock how could they have criminalized owning a share of a cow doesn't make any sense
[36:52.020 --> 36:56.780]  yeah well what they did is the department of health and mental hygiene they changed
[36:56.780 --> 37:02.060]  the definition of sale of raw milk so currently before that sales of raw milk were illegal
[37:02.060 --> 37:07.900]  and they just altered the definition to include cow share arrangements or any animal berry
[37:07.900 --> 37:12.980]  animal share arrangements to make that illegal as well they just changed the definition of
[37:12.980 --> 37:18.660]  sale to include those so of course a lot of the farmers who would do cow shares are also
[37:18.660 --> 37:24.860]  um they also have larger dairies that sell to co-ops and whatnot so the threat of being
[37:24.860 --> 37:30.420]  shut down and just being destitute financially keeps them from actually engaging in the contractual
[37:30.420 --> 37:36.540]  arrangements known as cow shares so does i assume there's a lot of support for the repeal
[37:36.540 --> 37:43.580]  of that you know very bad ill-conceived law i know you're testifying but tell us about
[37:43.580 --> 37:47.980]  the nature of the support today are there lots of people there to testify with you or
[37:47.980 --> 37:52.700]  what's going on well there are a tremendous number of people in support but unfortunately
[37:52.700 --> 37:59.060]  we are getting hit with our only snowstorm of the entire season today so a lot of people
[37:59.060 --> 38:02.900]  who are planning to be here in person are snowed in and they're submitting their written
[38:02.900 --> 38:07.340]  testimony to the committee oh wow they'll be heard and it's officially in the record
[38:07.340 --> 38:11.100]  they just won't be here in person well how appropriate since the entire criminalization
[38:11.100 --> 38:16.860]  of raw milk is such a snow job to begin with i guess nature is uh unfortunately interfering
[38:16.860 --> 38:23.060]  with your your ability to repeal that uh when when is an a decision expected based on all
[38:23.060 --> 38:29.060]  of this testimony well the hearing is today and then usually the committee votes like
[38:29.060 --> 38:34.700]  anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks after the hearing and then if it gets if it
[38:34.700 --> 38:39.500]  gets referred out of committee positively like if enough members vote yes in favor of
[38:39.500 --> 38:45.640]  it then it will go to the whole house here in maryland and then if it gets voted favorably
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.780]  out of the house it'll cross over to the senate and go through the same process there so it's
[38:49.780 --> 38:53.900]  still got several steps that need to be used to go through in order for this to become
[38:53.900 --> 39:00.140]  decriminalized wow so this happened and if not we're just hoping to see a lot of awareness
[39:00.140 --> 39:04.620]  built around the issue and for more people to look at the issue and start engaging directly
[39:04.620 --> 39:09.540]  with their local farmers so there are a lot of opportunities for the dairy industry to
[39:09.540 --> 39:14.540]  still uh intervene and and make sure that this doesn't get repealed right and they will
[39:14.540 --> 39:20.100]  be here today testifying in opposition as well as the health department so the the dairy
[39:20.100 --> 39:23.340]  industry just to be clear i mean i don't know what the case is there locally but in other
[39:23.340 --> 39:27.680]  states i've seen the dairy industry be very very aggressive at trying to monopolize the
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.680]  market of milk by you know criminalizing raw milk fresh milk and making sure that everybody
[39:32.680 --> 39:38.700]  has to buy their pasteurized homogenized factory produced product is that how bad is that situation
[39:38.700 --> 39:45.460]  in maryland oh it's also in maryland in the past about 20 years we've lost over 500 dairies
[39:45.460 --> 39:51.540]  we're down to only 496 right now which is it's dismal and the predictions from the dairy
[39:51.540 --> 39:56.300]  industry itself is that we're going to continue to lose dairy farms and they're going to the
[39:56.300 --> 40:00.820]  ones that are going to survive are going to continue to be subsidized by federal old tax
[40:00.820 --> 40:07.320]  dollars and their continued recommendation is to keep banning raw milk so here here we
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.820]  have the solution to the dairy failure problem and they're saying no no no don't do it it's
[40:13.820 --> 40:18.300]  it's reminiscent of like you know propping up a horse and buggy industry after the car
[40:18.300 --> 40:24.300]  comes on the market yeah incredible did you mention earlier that the name of the department
[40:24.300 --> 40:29.660]  there is called the department of health and mental hygiene is that correct that's correct
[40:29.660 --> 40:34.020]  that's the name of our health department here in mental hygiene what that's right is that
[40:34.020 --> 40:40.820]  like cleaning your mind of any aberrant thoughts what what what is mental hygiene well i've
[40:40.820 --> 40:47.680]  heard it uh translated as brainwashing well that's exactly what it is wow the department
[40:47.680 --> 40:52.980]  of mental hygiene that that should be in the novel 1984 i mean we should retroactively
[40:52.980 --> 40:58.100]  put that in in the novel the department of mental hygiene cleansing you of all dirty
[40:58.100 --> 41:04.500]  thoughts such as individual ideas or or fresh milk from a farm oh my god that what a terrible
[41:04.500 --> 41:08.620]  thing so right and just one of the most important things to take away from this and that what
[41:08.620 --> 41:12.620]  i'm going to be asking the committee members to take away from this is that currently peaceful
[41:12.620 --> 41:18.100]  individuals are being criminalized for normal natural peaceful human behavior whether it's
[41:18.100 --> 41:22.740]  transporting raw milk across state lines or the farmers who want to offer cow shares this
[41:22.740 --> 41:26.940]  is criminal activity but it's a very peaceful activity and so i'm going to be asking them
[41:26.940 --> 41:31.860]  to look at it in that context and to stop criminalizing our peaceful lives well and
[41:31.860 --> 41:40.180]  can you remind them that it's legal in cuba to do this it's it's legal to sell fresh milk
[41:40.180 --> 41:47.100]  in communist china in north korea you know i mean come on america land of the free you
[41:47.100 --> 41:53.940]  can't buy and sell fresh milk from a farm and that our country was was raised on raw
[41:53.940 --> 41:59.580]  milk i mean come on that's right i mean it's completely backwards right now it really is
[41:59.580 --> 42:05.500]  well apparently liz you have not had enough mental hygiene so you need some more mental
[42:05.500 --> 42:10.220]  hygiene therapies um give us your website uh so that people can you know stay tuned

[43:10.820 --> 43:16.260]  considered a felon i mean it's unbelievable i just i i can't believe that i have to sit

[44:39.300 --> 44:47.980]  is part of this cult of what i call giggling control freaks all right these giggling control

[45:29.300 --> 45:35.620]  you know kim jong-un is probably way worse than chavez it's a spectrum okay you've got
[45:35.620 --> 45:43.300]  kim jong-un on the far far far extreme radical left and then you've got chavez sort of not
[45:43.300 --> 45:47.620]  quite as far left but still pretty far left and then you've got you know obama right in
[45:47.620 --> 45:53.740]  there with the chavez crowd and you know you've got you know china communist china's over
[45:53.740 --> 45:59.500]  there and then on the on the far the the complete opposite end of the spectrum on the liberty
[45:59.500 --> 46:04.060]  side you've got like thomas jefferson okay that's the complete opposite but these giggling
[46:04.060 --> 46:08.380]  control freaks are driving me nuts they just want to run everything in your life and it's

[46:23.900 --> 46:29.980]  well i guess in that case it would be like the department i'm janet napolitano the department
[46:29.980 --> 46:37.580]  of homeland security i'm mrs bossy pants and here joining us today is mrs smarty pants

[47:22.500 --> 47:28.220]  sorry um we both sometimes segue into weird characters um weird comedy that's just that's
[47:28.220 --> 47:34.340]  just the nature of the beast all right north korea vows to cancel the korean war ceasefire
[47:34.340 --> 47:39.500]  north korea says that on march 11th that's just coming up by my account what is that
[47:39.500 --> 47:45.820]  five days away on march 11th it's going to cancel the the korean war ceasefire agreement
[47:45.820 --> 47:55.660]  that was originally signed in 1953 so how wonderful will that be with a an insane completely
[47:55.660 --> 48:03.900]  insane tyrant kim jong-un who has nuclear weapons all right and this guy is testing
[48:03.900 --> 48:11.340]  more nukes to miniaturize them to put them on intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms
[48:11.340 --> 48:16.900]  so that he can launch them into high altitude not even orbit but just high altitude above
[48:16.900 --> 48:24.660]  north america where he can detonate the nuke which will of course cause a massive emp blast
[48:24.660 --> 48:32.460]  that will fry the entire power grid so if there actually is a threat against america
[48:32.460 --> 48:37.060]  a military threat i'm not talking about the you know the fictional nonsense war on terror
[48:37.060 --> 48:41.500]  everything's war on terror if there's a real threat against america it's north korea all
[48:41.500 --> 48:48.260]  right if there's a real justification for going in and taking out a crazy nuclear armed
[48:48.260 --> 48:54.820]  tyrant who is threatening america like never before this is it kim jong-un i mean if if
[48:54.820 --> 49:01.340]  look overall i'm anti-war overall i'm anti-intervention i should say but i'm pro self-defense and
[49:01.340 --> 49:06.660]  i'm pro national defense this is a case for national defense i mean kim jong-un if he
[49:06.660 --> 49:11.020]  gets those nukes onto those missiles and he he launches them over you know california
[49:11.020 --> 49:15.540]  or oregon or washington and sets those off in high altitude man we're gonna have an emp
[49:15.540 --> 49:20.500]  blast wave your electronics are fried internet's down all these facebook ad addicts are running
[49:20.500 --> 49:24.100]  around the streets like zombies trying to be i'm not online i'm not online what do i
[49:24.100 --> 49:29.060]  do where's mrs bossy pants they're gonna freak out and they're and they're gonna be hungry
[49:29.060 --> 49:33.260]  in about six hours they're gonna try to come after your food i mean it's that's a nightmare
[49:33.260 --> 49:37.340]  scenario imagine imagine if all the facebook trolls actually came out of their parents
[49:37.340 --> 49:43.940]  basements all at once and flooding the streets with trolls and who actually have to face
[49:43.940 --> 49:48.780]  people face to face for the first time in their entire history it would be like what's
[49:48.780 --> 49:52.620]  that movie bruce willis uh surrogate right remember that we had to come out of there
[49:52.620 --> 49:56.860]  they were all like they had robots the virtual it wasn't virtual reality they were actually
[49:56.860 --> 50:02.260]  hardware robots running around the streets and but you would sit in your simulator control
[50:02.260 --> 50:06.340]  bed at home while your robot your surrogate was out there on the streets interacting with
[50:06.340 --> 50:13.980]  people and the surrogate was always like super cool you know uh model face perfect hair everything
[50:13.980 --> 50:18.460]  while the people back at home in their beds were all like these giant sloths and you know
[50:18.460 --> 50:25.340]  pale diseased you know can hardly muscle atrophy you can't even get out of the bed well that's
[50:25.340 --> 50:31.940]  what we become in society today so many people are not getting even out and if they have
[50:31.940 --> 50:37.280]  to get out it's gonna look like a zombie apocalypse even if it's not for real it's gonna look
[50:37.280 --> 50:43.380]  like it and it's gonna be it's gonna be real chaos so we better we better shut down kim
[50:43.380 --> 50:48.740]  jong-un is my point before he gets those nukes flying our direction all right stay with us
[50:48.740 --> 50:54.280]  we'll be right back on the alex jones show a lot more straight ahead and i will get more

[54:22.820 --> 54:27.860]  all right we're continuing thank you for joining us this is the alex jones show mike adams
[54:27.860 --> 54:33.900]  the health ranger filling in for alex today and be sure to check out infowars.com for
[54:33.900 --> 54:39.540]  the latest breaking news by paul joseph watson my website's naturalnews.com if you want to
[54:39.540 --> 54:46.940]  check that out and i've got a story on hugo tovez today and the the cancer of socialism
[54:46.940 --> 54:50.500]  by the way erin dykes just was talking to me during the break and he said that when
[54:50.500 --> 54:54.940]  he heard the phrase mental hygiene in our interview with liz reitzig that that set off
[54:54.940 --> 54:59.300]  a red flag in his mind because you know he researches a lot of the of the history of
[54:59.300 --> 55:04.900]  control of humans and the rockefellers and eugenics and everything else and he said yeah
[55:04.900 --> 55:10.380]  that that phrase mental hygiene is a keyword of the eugenics movement and that's the name
[55:10.380 --> 55:16.020]  of the maryland department it is actually called what is it the department of health
[55:16.020 --> 55:21.220]  and mental hygiene that's the name when liz said that it freaked me out i thought she
[55:21.220 --> 55:26.420]  misspoke or something but no that's the actual name of the department the department of health
[55:26.420 --> 55:34.300]  and mental hygiene so by that they probably mean castrating people of low iq to fulfill
[55:34.300 --> 55:40.580]  their their eugenics little agenda you know that's probably the history there i bet that's
[55:40.580 --> 55:45.180]  part of the history of that department in maryland i mean i can't say for sure i haven't
[55:45.180 --> 55:50.460]  done that research yet but i bet that's part of the uh part of the agenda and it's eugenics
[55:50.460 --> 55:56.900]  and depopulation and aaron dykes of course knows all about that racial hygiene mental
[55:56.900 --> 56:01.860]  hygiene and also hey don't forget the whole history of psychiatry where a psychiatrist
[56:01.860 --> 56:06.960]  would do things like if they thought you were mad they would start pulling organs out of
[56:06.960 --> 56:12.940]  your body in fact there was one psychiatrist in fact he was the president of the american
[56:12.940 --> 56:18.700]  psychiatric association way back i believe he was his name was dr henry cotton and if
[56:18.700 --> 56:24.860]  you were crazy he would start pulling your teeth out and he would actually extract teeth
[56:24.860 --> 56:29.940]  and then he started extracting like nasal tissue from people i mean very painful stuff
[56:29.940 --> 56:33.940]  until you were cured and if you were still mad after having you know all your teeth pulled
[56:33.940 --> 56:38.420]  out then he would just start you know yanking more and more tissue until he got to the real
[56:38.420 --> 56:42.300]  disease you know that's psychiatry for you right there i'm not even making that up that's
[56:42.300 --> 56:48.580]  real uh just just uh search dr henry cotton just like it sounds cotton if you don't believe
[56:48.580 --> 56:53.380]  me search that and you'll you know you'll freak out and then of course the entire term
[56:53.380 --> 56:59.700]  hysterectomy which is of course the surgical procedure of removing a woman's reproductive
[56:59.700 --> 57:08.380]  organs that whole term means hysteria ectomy means getting out the hysteria and that surgery
[57:08.380 --> 57:13.920]  was originally pushed as a way to prevent women from being crazy i'm not making this
[57:13.920 --> 57:21.300]  up this is true history that that is you got to know the entire word hysterectomy means
[57:21.300 --> 57:27.700]  take the craziness out of the woman and that's what that's that's the history of psychiatry
[57:27.700 --> 57:33.940]  that's the history of medicine it's insane so i'm not surprised to see the maryland department
[57:33.940 --> 57:40.060]  of health and mental hygiene being named the department of health and mental hygiene by
[57:40.060 --> 57:47.180]  the way if you want some real healthy uh health support immune support we've got clean chlorella

[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:44.340]  warriors fighting the info war so that we don't have to fight the physical war the real
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:50.380]  war of people slinging lead downrange now of course as i talked about in the first hour
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.080]  the radical left believes that all that's imaginary there are no bullets there are no
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.420]  guns there are no armored vehicles being purchased by dhs it's all just adds all your imagination
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:04.260]  but you and i know that it's actually real and so we want to fight the info war so that
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.820]  we can prevent the shooting war but we're not going to settle for anything less than
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:15.260]  the complete restoration of the bill of rights and the constitution that's the bottom line
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:20.940]  and i i know that those words that that i just spoke reflect what many of you feel out
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.200]  there we are not settling for anything less than the complete restoration of the bill
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.600]  of rights in the constitution why should we we're americans we were built on resistance
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.600]  to tyranny you know we're we're just we're not gonna voluntarily go along with another

[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.960]  money into the money supply making your dollars worth less and less every single day making
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.020]  the stock market look like it's higher and higher because it's it's the numbers of the

[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.540]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.980]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:17.900]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and

[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.420]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex today.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:36.260]  This is the second hour of our three-hour transmission, live from Austin, Texas, on
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:43.900]  this Wednesday, March 6th, 2013, the day after Hugo Chavez perished, at least his physical
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.900]  body did.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:51.380]  We can only guess where his soul is now, but his body has perished, apparently from cancer.
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.380]  And Venezuela is, of course, in the kind of turmoil right now, and no one's exactly sure
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:59.780]  what this means, what's going to happen next.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:04.100]  But here to give us a little bit of perspective on this is Max Cabrera.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.580]  He's an employee here at Infowars.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.140]  He's from Venezuela.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.140]  He doesn't have, you know, he's obviously not there, so he doesn't know, it's not like
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.700]  I'm right on the street, no.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.260]  He's here in Austin, Texas, but at least he can give us some perspective.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.340]  So, Max, thank you for joining us today.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:19.340]  Thanks for coming in studio.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.340]  Oh, Mike, thank you for the opportunity.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.340]  Glad to be here.
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:23.940]  Yeah, so give us, what do you know so far?
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.580]  Well, I have some information.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:30.020]  I have in calling people in Venezuela, and they're telling me, first of all, the streets
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.300]  are calm.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.300]  The army is out there.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:37.840]  They are taking care of the places, the gas stations, grocery stores, because there has
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.320]  been a lot of panic buyers on the streets.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.620]  And also, there has been a little bit of looting in certain areas, but everything's under control
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.620]  now.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:53.200]  So basically, the country is calm in action, but they are all confused about what's going
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.200]  to happen.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.200]  Right.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.540]  Now, the president is the former vice president of Venezuela.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.460]  His name is Nicolas Maduro.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:07.000]  He's going to be the president for the next 30 days, and then we will have elections there.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.100]  We don't know the candidates yet from opposition or from the Chavez party.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.100]  Right.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.860]  We're still waiting on that.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.200]  But even thinking about that, though, an opposition candidate would have to be a candidate that
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.640]  would say, well, let's return more to a free market system.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.220]  But how do you even propose that when so much of the Venezuelan population is now on the
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.980]  government payroll getting the free everything?
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.060]  I mean, that seems unlikely.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.060]  Right.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.980]  The opposition don't feel like they have a victory because, yes, the communism has been
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.020]  very well implemented in Venezuela.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.540]  A lot of people became dependent on the government.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:49.220]  And now the governors there, they keep pushing it like we have to keep going on this revolution.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:54.460]  They are taking all the ideology from Chavez and pushing it.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.000]  So there is nothing safe.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.940]  We can't say that, OK, we're out of communism now in Venezuela.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940]  Right.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]  Right.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.140]  Well, and of course, when they talk about they want to continue the revolution, they're
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:10.140]  talking about the Chavez revolution, which I guess he tried to begin in the early 1990s,
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.420]  but then he got into power in, what, 98?
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.420]  Yes.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.660]  And then he's been taking government seizing, private industry taking over the economy.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:22.780]  Also, I saw it was reported that Chavez himself amassed a personal fortune of $2 billion while
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:26.060]  his own countrymen were living in extreme poverty.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:33.220]  Well, yeah, he's being related to several weird scenarios that have evidence, but there
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:39.100]  have been some cases where he's being related to drug dealing, nothing for sure.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.100]  Right.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:48.440]  Well, I guess at this point then, we can't really do much here from America, it seems,
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.580]  but the people of Venezuela I feel deserve better than Chavez.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.680]  That's my feeling.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.300]  That's my feeling, too, especially because my family, they used to have businesses that
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.580]  were taken over.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.780]  Some of the businesses were still waiting to get paid for.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:08.620]  And a lot of families, they have been destroyed because of the communist ideology.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.700]  And the Venezuela people, they have been separated between the communists and people that doesn't
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:13.700]  support it.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.940]  Let's see if that changes now.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:22.200]  Hopefully there will be a free market again, and hopefully people will have the opportunity
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.700]  to, that they used to have previous to Chavez.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.700]  Okay.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:34.700]  Well, I want to wish your family safety and blessings to them and all of your countrymen
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.260]  and women, of course.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:41.660]  I want to see Venezuela become more free.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:45.900]  I suspect you do as well, but whatever happens, will you keep us posted?
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.140]  Yes, of course.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.980]  And if the elections, whenever we have the date for the elections, I will go down there
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:54.620]  to Venezuela to vote, and I will bring some video and pictures.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:58.780]  I will talk to the people over there, and I will bring that back to you.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:04.540]  Real quick, do you think, will Venezuelan elections be as corrupt as American elections
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.740]  are, or will they be more honest?
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.220]  Actually, I was surprised the way they do the elections, because I went over there and
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.780]  I actually have some footage of it.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:12.820]  You have to vote.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:16.220]  You do an electronic vote, and then you get a receipt of your vote.
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.220]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.220]  We don't get receipts in America.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:22.380]  You get a receipt, you put it in another box, and then at the end of the day, you're welcome
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.780]  to come in and they print out what they have electronically, and then they count all the
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.780]  receipts.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:28.780]  Oh, wow.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.780]  Everybody's welcome to see it.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.780]  And I was actually there.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.780]  Common sense.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:35.420]  It has to match what they have in the boxes, what they have electronically.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:40.380]  And then when it's approved by the people that was there, they send that information.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:45.400]  So it looks like if they are corrupting the elections, they are doing it fantastically,
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.400]  because it's not cash.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400]  It's not cash.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.620]  How amazing is it that Venezuela runs a more, well, a checksum system in the elections,
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.300]  which is smarter than the way we run them here, which is all just total electronic black
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.300]  box voter fraud.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:05.300]  And something else is that we do get a president because of the votes of the people.
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:08.620]  So if somebody has 100 votes, that's what you're getting, 100 votes.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.620]  Yeah.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.780]  If you have 1,000, then you get 1,000.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.780]  So it's not here like the electoral votes.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.180]  Oh, the electoral college.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.180]  The electoral college.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.180]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:22.420]  And also, now Venezuela doesn't have a bill of rights like America does.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:28.740]  It has a constitution, but it doesn't enumerate specific rights in the same way that we have
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.740]  it here.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.740]  Okay.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740]  Correct?
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:32.740]  Correct.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:40.100]  So is that a barrier to the people protecting themselves from the march of tyranny?
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:44.580]  Well, this really, in Venezuela, we have a problem, which we have a lot of loss, but
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.300]  they are not being considered.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:52.140]  For example, right now, Nicolas Maduro, the vice president, he shouldn't be the president.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.140]  He shouldn't?
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.140]  He shouldn't.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.060]  It should be Diosdado Cabello.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:00.320]  And he just decided this other guy to be the president meanwhile.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:05.860]  So even though we have the constitution and we have rights, they are really not implemented.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.700]  At the end of the day, it's kind of a tyranny going on there, and they do whatever they
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.700]  want.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.340]  And last question for you, Max, because I know you've got a lot of work to do here,
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.860]  but isn't, it's oil.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:18.980]  I mean, oil is the big money maker in Venezuela.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:21.420]  So it really comes down to who controls the oil, doesn't it?
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420]  Right.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.560]  Yeah, it is like that.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.860]  So nobody knows in Venezuela, the prices of the oil, we don't know if they're gonna go
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:28.860]  up.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:34.820]  I can tell you right now, Venezuela is in a phase where they don't know what's happening.
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:38.740]  They don't know what's coming next, if it is something better or worse.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:44.820]  Yesterday, as soon as the news was given, I tried calling my family, they called, couldn't
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:45.820]  get in.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:49.940]  I mean, people got excited, people went out to the streets to buy water, food.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.940]  People don't-
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:51.940]  I don't blame them.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.940]  Yeah, they don't know what's going on.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.900]  Well, and I think, by the way, Chavez, he only died at age 58, I believe, right?
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.900]  Right.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:15:59.900]  Very young.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:00.900]  Very young, yes.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:05.180]  And he probably didn't know that there are natural cures for cancer, many of them.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.720]  Yeah, I think it's sad that he went to Cuba to get treatment.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.180]  We have great doctors in Venezuela, and actually, I will say, we have a better medical industry
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:17.340]  in Venezuela than there is in Cuba.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.660]  So I'm shocked that he went over there.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.300]  I think that's like an slap in the face for the doctors in Venezuela.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.660]  Yeah, it is, really.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.800]  And maybe he wasn't scared of all the doctors there.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:33.140]  So I mean, it is shocking how he just left the country to get the treatment there.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:36.420]  But probably he didn't know about natural ways to do it.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:43.580]  Well, only the really high level elite know about the cures for cancer, because the global
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:48.540]  elite, like the top 1,000 controllers of the world, they have easy access to all these
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:49.540]  cures.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:50.540]  Right.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.980]  But they don't want the public to know about them.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:58.740]  Well, thank you, Max, for the update on Venezuela and Hugo Chavez no longer being with us.
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:01.940]  I have to say he was a great leader.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.980]  Seriously, he knew how to talk to people.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.540]  He knew how to relate to people.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:09.820]  Well, I mean, Obama, I mean, Hitler was a great orator, you know?
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:13.820]  Yes, I'm not saying he was doing something right or wrong, I'm just saying he was a great
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:14.820]  leader.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:15.820]  Right.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.320]  Right now there are thousands and thousands of people on the streets supporting him.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.300]  They want to see his body.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.180]  So he was really a great leader in South America and around the world.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.140]  Too bad his ideology wasn't the most appropriate for the country.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.340]  Well, you know, I used to live in South America, not Venezuela, but I noticed that the cultures
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:40.060]  there do tend to side towards socialism and communism.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.060]  Right.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.900]  That just seems to be part of the cultural reflection down there.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:49.300]  But I do believe that the people of Venezuela deserve much better than Chavez, and I would
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:53.340]  like to see that nation become a nation of liberty and individual freedom.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340]  I would like that too.
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.340]  Well, thank you, Max.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.340]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.340]  All right.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:03.260]  Thank you very much, everybody here in studio at Infowars.com with a little bit of first
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:08.020]  hand knowledge of what's going on in Venezuela.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.100]  Now continuing, by the way, we've got James Stewart on the line.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.100]  Is he?
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.260]  We actually have him by Skype, guys.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.660]  Is he on the line?
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.620]  Okay, great, great.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:22.500]  Because we sort of delayed James Stewart because of this, of Max coming in with the breaking
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.240]  news on Chavez.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.580]  So let me just say this.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:32.380]  There's another story on Infowars.com, Russian leader demands the investigation of Chavez's
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.580]  death and they're trying to blame his death on America.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:43.100]  Yeah, they're saying America gave him cancer, which actually, if you think about it, America
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.020]  gives Americans cancer.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.820]  So it's really not that far fetched.
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:53.140]  Maybe Chavez came to America, drank some diet soda, ate a bunch of aspartame, got some GMOs,
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:57.740]  took some vaccines, and yeah, he died of cancer, just like half the American population because
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.720]  of all this toxic food and medicine in this country.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.340]  So maybe they're right.
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.500]  Maybe America did give the guy cancer, who knows?
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.340]  All right, let's transition.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.260]  We've got an incredible story here.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.540]  Many of you know James Stewart.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:16.100]  He's known as the California raw milk man, but this story today is not about raw milk.
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:20.720]  This is about one man overcoming state tyranny.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.620]  The state of California tried to destroy this man.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.860]  They threw him in jail.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.260]  I mean, they practically tortured him in prison there.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:33.880]  I'm not going to go into details, but they mistreated him like you can't even believe
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.860]  and they brought him up on multiple felony charges.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.620]  They tagged him in the jail system as a dangerous prisoner.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:45.800]  They tried to crush him and he has come back with an entrepreneurial victory that will
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:51.060]  make you cheer, and he'll be joining us straight ahead right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:55.100]  It's James Stewart joining us by Skype, so stay with us and we'll be right back with

[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:06.180]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:10.740]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:14.620]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.820]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:35.820]  IRAs?
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.820]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.500]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.980]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:16.460]  All right, for this segment and into the next, we're going to be joined by California raw
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:23.420]  milkman James Stewart with his story of overcoming an attempted crushing of his liberties and
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:28.980]  freedoms by the state, not just the state of California, but the federal government
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:33.540]  had a hand in the raw milk raids against him, but again, he's got a story of coming back
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]  from that.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.380]  And James, thank you for joining us today on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:38.380]  You're welcome, Mike.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.380]  Thank you.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.380]  It's great to have you on.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.180]  Sorry about the delay there, but Hugo Chavez dying was definitely some breaking news we
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.380]  needed to cover there.
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:51.300]  Well, I was actually listening to that and I think just one choice of words in there
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.380]  should have been changed and when he called him a great leader, I think great sort of
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.940]  a connotates the idea of good.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.620]  I think he should have used the word powerful leader, right?
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.620]  That's right.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.620]  Yeah.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.900]  I don't, I don't think that max, you know, worships a Chavez or anything.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:10.780]  I think he was saying that he was an effective manipulator of the masses, exactly.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.780]  Basically.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.780]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.780]  Yeah.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.780]  Well, well said.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.780]  Thanks for helping us clarify that.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:21.060]  So James, you've got an amazing story here laid out for us, but, but just quickly first
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:23.860]  give us a very quick background of what happened to you.
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.620]  For those who may not be familiar with your story and then we'll go into how you've overcome
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:28.620]  that.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:34.660]  Well, you know, for 15 years we we when I say we, the community that was was called
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:41.780]  Rossum you know, continued to grow and until the community was over a thousand people approximately
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:47.100]  of people that wanted to find the highest quality foods and that was always a influx
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.100]  as well.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.980]  We were looking for higher quality foods, but we were continually being attacked 2005,
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:57.700]  2010 and then finally closed in 2011 with my arrest.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:03.700]  And you know, it, it turned out to I thought that it would all end pretty quickly and it
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.700]  did not at all.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]  And it just kept on going.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.940]  The, the case in LA was postponed and then continued.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:14.820]  And then, then we, then I, myself and a lady named Sharon Palmer were arrested while standing
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:21.700]  in court on March the 2nd of last year for more felonies for the farm being purchased
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.700]  in Santa, Santa Paula.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:31.100]  Of course, I and the club had very little to do with the investment in the farm if anything
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.460]  and that was handled by other people.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:41.980]  And so, you know, I ended up going to jail actually on my birthday of this last year.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:48.180]  I was in jail for five, almost four and a half to five months and then was transferred
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.180]  to LA.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:56.900]  And by the way, when I was arrested for the, the charges for in March the 2nd of last year,
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:02.620]  I was actually taken first to Twin Towers, downtown LA, which is where they took me,
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:07.940]  singled me out of line out of hundreds and hundreds of, I would consider real criminals,
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.220]  you know, the people that were the thieves and the drug addicts and the murderers and
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:17.820]  the whatever, singled out by two guards taken into an office and accused of being and asked
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:19.740]  me if I were a sovereign.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.940]  And I said, I don't know what you mean by that.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:27.340]  And anyway, the long story was short is that they labeled me that and tortured me at that
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:32.260]  point by shackling me hand and foot and shackled me to a bench, put me in a holding tank for
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:38.460]  about five or six hours in a tank that probably was, nobody was in there, cold about 50 degrees
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.100]  with a t-shirt on.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.380]  And then finally, four days later, transferred to Ventura.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:47.380]  Well, when I was transferred back after I left jail in Ventura and they scanned my wrist
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:51.660]  band that I had on there, the guy backed up from his desk and said, you've attacked guards?
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.820]  And I said, excuse me?
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.320]  And the man said, oh no, shackle this man.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.860]  So obviously the status that now exists for me in the Los Angeles jail system is one as
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:06.660]  of a sovereign, which means that I'm a threat to everybody and I'm a terrorist.
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:13.040]  So yeah, this is incredible because your crime is distributing milk, unpasteurized milk.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.820]  So they label you in the jail system as a sovereign.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:23.060]  They have you wear a special armband, just like Hitler made the Jews back in Nazi time.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.900]  They treated you worse than a terrorist.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.900]  It's an incredible story.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.060]  I don't want to dwell on that, but I'm glad you provided that background so people know
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.820]  why this story is important.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.580]  And by the way, you are correct, the wristbands they put on you are different colors depending
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.820]  on your supposed status.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.600]  That's incredible.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.780]  But despite this, I mean, their goal, I mean, you're a man in your mid-60s and you're not
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.780]  a young man.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:51.080]  Most of those people were young and better able to handle that, but they subjected you
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.700]  to hypothermia, a type of torture, but yet you've been able to overcome this.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:00.380]  Now we're going to break in one minute and I want you to tell the complete story now
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:05.620]  of what you're doing now to rise out of this attempt to crush your freedoms and crush your
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:06.620]  life.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:09.220]  I want to do that when we come out.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.020]  But in the one minute we have left, give us an update.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:16.340]  Are you still facing charges in one county or is that resolved?
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:24.100]  No, still facing charges in one county and we're not sure where that's going to go, but
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100]  it's daunting.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:29.860]  I mean, at one point I had three criminal cases and three civil cases that I was dealing
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.740]  with all at the same time.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:32.740]  Incredible.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:36.780]  And they confiscated all your food, all your cash, threw you in jail, destroyed the food.
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.780]  It's just incredible.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.780]  And destroyed the club.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.780]  Destroyed the club.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.780]  Yeah, it's shut down.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780]  It's gone.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:42.780]  It's gone.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.540]  Sounds like something Hugo Chavez would have done in Venezuela, actually.
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.540]  Anyway, stay with us, folks.
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:49.980]  We'll be right back with James Stewart and his success story of overcoming tyranny on
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.980]  the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.980]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.980]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:30:01.260]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.020]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.320]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.100]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:29.020]  Alright, continuing with our interview with James Stewart and his achievement, his victory
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.940]  over attempted oppression.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.980]  The state tried to crush his freedoms, tried to throw him in jail for the crime of selling
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.260]  raw milk in America.
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:45.860]  America is not even illegal in Cuba, in China, in North Korea or you know Peru or anywhere
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:50.260]  else it seems like but in America it is a crime for most places.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:57.820]  So anyway, James go ahead now tell us what you're doing now as a you know a victory against
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.340]  their attempt to crush your life.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:05.260]  Okay, well the one thing I wanted to share with people for 30 seconds is the reason why
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:11.860]  they have done this sovereign thing is because people actually believe like Judge Napolitano,
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:16.620]  you see him on TV all the time, you know the Constitution still exists.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:22.680]  Their justification and answer to my question is why was well people have been murdering
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:25.980]  other people and killing other people and calling them sovereigns, they're shooting
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.220]  police officers and what so how do we know that's not you?
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:34.020]  That was their answer, I asked them a question, that was their answer.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.940]  Well you know according to the Constitution we're all sovereign individuals, are we not?
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:44.140]  And their answer is so everybody's aware of that is now if you actually believe in the
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.940]  Constitution pretty much you're already labeled as a sovereign which means that you're already
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:49.940]  a terrorist.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:54.780]  Well did you hear in the first hour we covered all these bullets being purchased by the government,
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:59.220]  the assault rifles, the armored vehicles, it's all imaginary we're told.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:03.760]  Yes, yeah I heard that and I'm fully aware of all that as well.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.780]  But you know to get back to your question is one of the products that we had on the
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:14.860]  shelf at the club was a one of the most amazing products that I ever came across and it was
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:20.500]  an olive oil out of the country of Spain in which the trees themselves are anywhere from
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:26.740]  three to eight hundred almost a thousand years old, I was amazed and the story about this
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:32.140]  oil is the man that resurrected all this also resurrected two mills which had been idled
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:37.540]  for you know for twenty, thirty, forty years and never changed the inside of the mills
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:42.620]  so they're produced the same way that olive oil has been produced for thousands of years
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:47.860]  which is just big granite stones crushing it and then some pressure to push out the
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:53.780]  oil and whatnot then it's only bottled upon request so our first shipment will be arriving
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:36:01.660]  in about thirty days and you know people came in and purchased it at Rossum and would come
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:07.180]  back saying oh my god that's the best, that's the best oil I've ever tasted you know and
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:13.180]  the person who runs the company, his name is Antonio Ray Sol is a former organic beekeeper
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:19.860]  so the man understands you know sustainability, he understands non-GMO, he understands organic
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:24.240]  you know so it's a pleasure to work with somebody who's still out there wanting to do the right
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.240]  thing.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:30.700]  See so that's what I love about this story is so you're working with this olive orchard
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:34.300]  out of Spain that's eight hundred years old.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:38.700]  Well the trees themselves are eight hundred years old, I don't know if the property has
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:44.380]  changed hands how many times but you know the trees themselves and you see these trees
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:50.700]  they're just magnificent and by the way I'm not sure that the people involved with me
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.500]  want to give out the website yet because it will be inundated most likely when that happens
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.900]  so I think we might have to wait about another week or so before we do that.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:04.620]  It's no big deal I'll do a story about your website when the time comes this here today
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:10.580]  is more about you how you are achieving an entrepreneurial victory and creating business
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:16.140]  and creating prosperity when they tried to crush you I mean the state of California would
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:22.460]  rather you rot in prison but instead you are creating opportunities and health for people
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.460]  that's amazing.
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:31.060]  Mike I never give up I'll be 66 in July but no you're right and by the way I have no desire
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:38.540]  to collect unemployment or be entitled that the handouts and whatnot I've never functioned
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:42.900]  that way and so it took and I actually said when I was in jail that that was what I was
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:47.620]  planning to do this whole thought of mine to do this and become the exclusive distributor
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:53.180]  for this incredible product was actually launched last year before I was even put in jail and
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.700]  luckily the owner of the company decided he'd wait for me.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.180]  What a great guy.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:04.220]  Well what do you see as given the experience of what happened to you because I can imagine
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:08.900]  when you were a child let's say and growing up and going to elementary school and they
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.900]  were teaching you American history and you were doing the Pledge of Allegiance to the
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:18.280]  flag you never could have imagined I would say that you would be thrown in jail over
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.500]  milk.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:26.120]  I never imagined I'd be thrown in jail for helping to provide high quality foods to people
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:32.620]  in a private membership club no the thought of that now to me is incredulous in its insanity
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:36.060]  but that's exactly what has happened.
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:43.820]  Do you and I mean you felt it personally are you concerned about the direction of this
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:48.020]  country or I mean where do you think this is all going?
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:53.620]  Very concerned you know you and I talk about this and you report on this all the time about
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:57.800]  what's going on with the quality of the food sources around the country and around the
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:03.700]  world and you know I see what's going on not only with what happened to us but what's
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:09.420]  happening to farmers of all different kinds whether it's produce, pigs or milk or whatnot
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:13.500]  it's getting crazier every day and you hear stories even more and more all the time where
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:18.880]  they're basically trying to squash anybody that wants to get involved in I guess high
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.420]  quality you know food.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:26.340]  Right well we heard from Liz Reitzig earlier that the number of dairies small private dairies
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:31.340]  or you know commercial dairies in Maryland has been reduced by 50%.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:37.960]  We saw what the pigs in Michigan the farmers were ordered to shoot their own pigs to kill
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.940]  them because of that crazy law that just went into effect there.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:48.020]  We've seen front yard gardens attacked in Michigan, in Oklahoma, in Florida, we've got
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:53.700]  the raw milk raids on you, the morning land dairy in Missouri and many others I mean these
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.020]  keep adding up James.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:40:00.940]  No they're now into the hundreds I'm guessing and it just seems like it's going to get worse
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:05.620]  rather than better and I just think that everybody needs to be more and more aware of what's
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:11.740]  really going on on the food source issue of think codes, regulations, laws are all being
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:16.500]  written and forced upon people and then you can't even even when you're supposedly doing
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:21.580]  it correctly they still come after you I mean my favorite story is the farm to fork in Nevada.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:26.180]  Oh that's where they raided that that outdoor picnic type of thing?
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:32.060]  It was 16 or you know a dozen or so farmers all meeting on each other's private property
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.500]  bartering each other I'll give you eggs if you give me produce or your chicken or whatnot
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:42.380]  and they were contacted by the county and the state of Nevada saying that they needed
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:46.580]  a permit to do it and then when she got the permit they came in basically after she had
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:50.900]  given them authority to control her they came and poured bleach over everything and destroyed
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:52.420]  the entire community.
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:57.180]  Well that's the pattern that we see here it is the destruction of food and this fits the
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:02.660]  pattern from the top from the White House the destruction of the economy, the destruction
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:07.660]  of jobs, the destruction of liberties Eric Holder just said yesterday this is a letter
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:13.740]  to Senator Rand Paul that yes the president can order the assassination of American citizens
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:20.460]  on US soil that's the Attorney General saying that and it's that's blatantly illegal.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:25.580]  I saw that with with Judge Napolitano being interviewed this morning.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:26.580]  I like that guy.
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:31.020]  Yeah I really like it well why do you think they took his show Freedom Watch off the air?
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.620]  Well of course yeah I can't have too much freedom did you see you can't even have a
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:36.700]  freedom license plate in Washington DC that's been banned.
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.700]  You can't.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:38.700]  No I didn't know that.
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:41.740]  No you can't drive around Washington with the word freedom on your car it's illegal.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:45.260]  Oh my god it's just getting so insane.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:50.020]  Yeah it is insane well we're about out of time here James but do you I know you don't
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.020]  want to give out that your your olive oil website yet but do you have another website
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.020]  about.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.020]  You'll be helping out with that anyway but.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.520]  Yeah we'll get it out for you but you have a blog website or something where people can
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.660]  follow you and what you're doing?
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:05.580]  Yeah I might as well give it out it's under the name Oliflish and Flish is the town in
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:12.860]  Spain where the olive oil is produced and that is pronounced or spelled F-L-I-X as an
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:18.300]  x-ray and so it's O-L-I-F-L-I-X-N-A.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.300]  As in North America.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.300]  Got it.
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.300]  Northamerica.com.
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.300]  Alright that's a tricky domain name.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.140]  And our website is up and running but we're not completely prepared yet but I think we
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.020]  will be in the next seven days.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.860]  Yeah this is kind of a pre-launch situation but really I just thank you for joining us
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:38.380]  I'm just glad that you have refused to lie down you've refused to become part of the
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:43.580]  system that was trying to crush you and you were standing out with American innovation
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:47.300]  and entrepreneurial ideas and that's what made America great.
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.100]  And I will be until the day I'm not here anymore Mike.
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:51.100]  Good for you man.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.100]  Well good to have you on today.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:53.100]  Mike thank you.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:54.660]  Alright thank you James.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:43:04.460]  That was James Stewart everybody the now resurging reborn in a new entrepreneurial context California
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:11.660]  raw milk man going to be dealing with olive oil now from hundreds of years old trees in
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:16.980]  Spain that's it's just it's just it's an amazing story I like to have these stories of success
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:21.180]  against the system you know and actually if you think about it info wars is another story
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.200]  of success against the system.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.020]  They tried to buy out essentially Alex Jones and put him on the networks they tried to
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:31.200]  say here take this money will make you famous and he said no he said I'm going to build
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.940]  it myself I'm going to I'm going to you know wherever it leads me I'm going to do it myself
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:40.020]  and he did and that's why info wars is here today.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:46.380]  So Dr. Len Saputo joins us now for the next segment he's on the phone with us Dr. Saputo
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.180]  welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:50.220]  Thank you good to be here.
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:55.620]  Thanks for being on it's great to have you joining us now for our listeners who may not
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:44:02.320]  be familiar with you you are of course a doctor with a lot of alternative and holistic medical
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.860]  knowledge and integration therapies lots of experience in that realm but I wanted to talk
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:15.760]  to you today about two things in particular Dr. Saputo and that is GMOs and vaccine damage
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.100]  to children.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:18.100]  Which one do you want to start with?
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.100]  Either one doesn't matter.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.180]  Alright well let's start with the vaccines because there's news that just came out today
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:27.580]  that vaccines increase the risk of narcolepsy in children by an astonishing amount we've
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:32.260]  also had recent admissions by the scientific community that flu shots given to pregnant
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:38.540]  women cause a massive increase in spontaneous abortions so we know that the vaccines are
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:42.420]  killing babies and when they're not killed they're often damaged what are your thoughts
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:45.140]  on the subject Dr. Saputo?
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:51.540]  Well we know that the whole flu shot industry is a scam there is very little data that shows
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:56.180]  that first of all the shot even works in fact there's some data suggesting that it actually
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:04.320]  increases the risks that we have for getting influenza it has not been tested for its safety
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:10.580]  adequately when you talk to people like Tom Jefferson who is from the Cochrane group who
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:15.580]  is a very prestigious group he says that the only thing that we really need to do if we're
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:22.660]  going to solve this problem is go ahead and take one group of people who has had the vaccine
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:26.300]  and see how they do over a year whether or not it works or it doesn't work and what kind
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.860]  of side effects and complications there are and take another group and don't give them
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:36.780]  the vaccine and see what happens and of course that is a simple inexpensive very effective
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.060]  way of testing vaccines but nobody wants to do that.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:43.340]  Yeah they refuse to do that test they don't because they're horrified of the data that
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.500]  will come out of that.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:48.140]  Well I think that's true and you're talking about an industry that's got a tremendous
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:52.260]  amount of income you're looking at hundreds of billions of dollars every year that is
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:56.340]  that comes in that way so it's not like it's a small amount of money and the conflicts
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:46:02.340]  of interest that exist between the CDC the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry are glaring
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:07.180]  it's like a revolving door between the CDC and the pharmaceutical industry and look what
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:15.500]  happened to Julie Gerberding who was the chief of the CDC before Obama came into office when
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:18.100]  her term was up she's employed by who?
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:19.100]  Merck Vaccines.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:23.060]  Yeah right leading the global vaccine division I believe.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:27.540]  Oh right and some of the things they came out with with this vaccine is just atrocious
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:31.740]  I mean the data behind it is terrible I wrote an article called the Infection Deception
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:35.540]  that's a free article it was published in the Townsend letter if people want to go to
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:40.340]  my website at drsaputo.com it's free and on the home page.
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.300]  Is your website is it drsaputo or spelled out drsaputo?
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:48.420]  Either way it's d-r-s-a-p-u-t-o will get you there.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:52.540]  Okay you're a smart man cover every every combination.
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.400]  Well what about this I mean they could make clean vaccines if they wanted to they could
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:02.960]  make single shot vaccines that have no mercury no MSG no formaldehyde they could do that
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:11.180]  but it seems to me when this is my next question for you do they is it is it such a deep conspiracy
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:18.660]  that they're actually intentionally using vaccines as a a way in which to damage babies
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:19.660]  on purpose.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:24.340]  Well you know you have to think that when you look at what's happened that something
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.540]  like that is happening you wouldn't think anybody would be vindictive enough to do that
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:34.580]  haha yeah check human history man that's what they're doing yeah and so I mean you have
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:39.700]  to make the assumption that somebody doesn't care about our children and they're trying
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.980]  or they do care about them enough that they want to make them sick because that's what's
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:43.980]  happening.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:48.300]  Well or that they care about profit more than the than lives because if you if you brain
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:53.060]  damage a child or you damage their immune system with an early vaccine you actually
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.740]  generate recurring profits in the pharmaceutical industry for decades.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:02.780]  Well that's right so it's it's a business investment the vaccine is a business investment
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:08.660]  in a damaged life well what you're looking at is a whole system in this country where
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:13.700]  money talks and where service is if it's there that's fine but if it's not they don't really
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:19.620]  care I mean look at the Vioxx story I mean when the pharmaceutical industry put that
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:24.780]  drug out in 1994 they knew that that was going to kill people with heart attacks and strokes
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:29.500]  yeah when the drug came out in 1999 they didn't do anything to mention that to the FDA that
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.620]  we know about yet in 2004 when the finally the FDA was forced to take it off the market
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:40.300]  because there were about 50,000 deaths from heart attacks and strokes I mean there was
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:44.220]  no no punishment it was a murder.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:49.140]  Well no I believe it wasn't a Dr. David Graham the chief FDA scientist who even testified
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:53.540]  to that fact exactly and for several other drugs as well.
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:59.180]  So I mean just that one drug Vioxx if you really look at the numbers the one drug according
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:06.020]  to FDA science scientist testimony killed more Americans than the entire Vietnam War.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:12.020]  Oh listen you're talking about a pittance of deaths when you look in big pharma I mean
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:17.580]  there are what 10,000 deaths not even that from the whole war that was in Iraq and now
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:26.060]  in Afghanistan and we lose 400,000 people a year and this is documented okay from pharmaceutical
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:31.180]  drugs and side effects and complications and things that happen you know even that are
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.180]  expected.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.960]  Well that's why it's so astonishing to me that the mainstream media will play up things
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:41.680]  like Sandy Hook and the shooting of several dozen children which is absolutely tragic
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:46.460]  and those lives should not be lost but then you've got an industry that's killing orders
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:54.860]  of magnitude more children you know every day and through vaccines and chemotherapy
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:58.940]  drugs are now given to pregnant women which causes spontaneous abortions you know the
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:02.260]  flu shots are given to pregnant women it's insane.
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:07.300]  Well there's no question that the system is insane and that's what happens when you have
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:12.740]  a level of consciousness which we have in this country which is about me my mind and
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:18.060]  my stuff it's not about community it's not about trying to build community it's not about
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:23.160]  taking care of your neighbor it's not working together and until we increase our level of
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.180]  consciousness to a different level we'll never solve these problems that we're facing so
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:32.900]  being outraged isn't sufficient you have to evolve into that place where you want to be
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:34.140]  the change you want to see.
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:39.060]  Well let's talk about that change because first give us well we're about to go to break
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:43.340]  but when we come back from break I want you to give us what can people do instead of taking
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.340]  a flu shot.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:45.340]  There you go.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:46.340]  What works better?
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:47.340]  A lot.
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:52.500]  Yeah a lot better because like you I haven't taken a shot in more than a decade I can't
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:58.680]  even remember the last time I had a vaccine and health has only improved since then hardly
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.620]  ever get sick I just rely on.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:06.140]  If you're listening you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day if you're listening

[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:16.700]  will shock you I just created a free video at crisis one two three dot com that reveals
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:22.460]  a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis ninety seven percent of Americans
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:26.860]  don't have this one critical item in fact they haven't even given it a thought and the
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:32.140]  sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving

[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:21.460]  I'd like to have another kiss another flash alright welcome back this is the Alex Jones
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:26.880]  Show we're joined by Dr. Len Saputo right now we're talking about vaccine damaged babies
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.880]  and how the system seems to be actually intentionally trying to poison children and pregnant mothers
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.180]  with the vaccines because they could if they chose make so-called clean vaccines which
[01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:43.040]  don't have the toxic metals and chemicals that are known to cause neurological damage
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.120]  and basically brain lobotomies so Dr. Saputo we before the break we said we're gonna talk
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:53.640]  about some solutions what works better than the flu shot oh just about everything we don't
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:59.240]  even know the flu shot works we have no data no data that shows that the flu shot works
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.420]  for kids or really anybody else okay that's a powerful statement to make but it's true
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:08.760]  our lifestyle is the most important thing vitamin D in particular get out and get some
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:14.280]  sun when our vitamin D levels go down our immune system goes down and when it goes down
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.280]  you're vulnerable to all kinds of things going wrong not just virus infections like the flu
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:25.520]  but also cancers and and all other and many of the diseases we need vitamin C in that
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.040]  setting as well our diet is crucial but real quick back on vitamin D though a lot of people
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.560]  think they can just go out and buy a supplement that's like 400 I use they just take one of
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:39.480]  those every couple of days and they're covered why is that not enough well it's totally inadequate
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.480]  I mean our body needs four or five thousand I use a day yeah that's the standard amount
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:49.520]  and it needs to be taken with food or taken in a liquid that's sublingual or some other
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.000]  way that it gets into the body otherwise it doesn't absorb well and we have an epidemic
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:00.060]  of vitamin D deficiency that's enormous at this time most people are low in vitamin D
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:05.600]  levels and as I said immunity goes south of that time yeah it's like 95% of the population
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:10.760]  is deficient exactly particularly in the winter time where we don't get the UVB rays which
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:16.560]  are only present by the way in the rest the rest of the season is between 10 and 2 in
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.920]  the daytime because there's no UVB there and isn't this also just one more symptom of what
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:27.880]  we might call indoor disease living indoors working indoors never getting outside you're
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:32.960]  going to be deficient the human body was made to be outside and and we do we live in an
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:37.840]  asphalt jungle basically that where we just don't get sun and it doesn't go through blast
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:41.160]  by the way so you can't get it through the window you got to be out in the sun with your
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:47.680]  skin exposed but then the system tells us that the sun is bad that the sun is evil listen
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:52.880]  without too much of anything's no good okay well right I mean you don't want to fry yourself
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.680]  obviously but that's right and it's when you get excessive burning of the skin that you
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.800]  get into problems with the cancer but otherwise vitamin D prevents cancer we know a lot of
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.720]  data on that well but it's also you're more likely to get sunburned if you're deficient
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:10.440]  in other antioxidants there you go sure you've got to eat a healthy diet right people don't
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:16.200]  realize that you need your fruits and vegetables and all those antioxidants are in there absolutely
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:20.680]  diet's huge sleeps another thing if you don't get enough sleep your immune system goes south
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.560]  miss just four or five hours one night and your natural killer cells which fight against
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:30.440]  cancer and viral infections goes down 30 percent and the same thing with exercise too much
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:35.920]  no good not enough no good got it exercise on those days for about an hour and then we're
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:40.480]  exposed to all these toxic things in the environment that cause a tremendous suppression of our
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:46.360]  immune system and the rest of our body we got about a minute less left Dr. Saputo so
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:51.440]  to summarize things that work better than flu shot what would you say list okay vitamin
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:56.360]  D sunshine get your diet where you're eating fruits and vegetables and the healthy things
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:04.360]  you need exercise sleep stress reduction avoidance of toxic exposures and then there are things
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:10.320]  like beta glucans and echinacea vitamin A the mushrooms the maitake and shiitake mushrooms
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:16.880]  selenium and zinc herbs such as olive extract and garlic the homeopathic remedies all these
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.440]  things are fantastic and way better than a flu shot yeah the people that need the flu
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.680]  shot are people that don't have a good immune system they're the last ones that will respond
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:29.880]  to the flu well and they're also the most likely to be damaged by it if your immune
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:33.840]  system is already weak and you get a flu shot that's when you're lobotomized because you
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:38.200]  don't have any defenses against the toxic ingredients we got it backwards we can dr

[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:21.440]  it's going to be healthier yeah absolutely and even even if the the news from the real
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:26.640]  world it seems negative and gets you down you still you can still have fun with it like
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.560]  we made fun of the tsa that was really funny you could find ways to make fun of things
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:38.560]  yeah well laughter is a very good medicine maybe they'll ban laughter then because they'll
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.120]  call it you know it's it's it's an illegal drug the fda says when you laugh your brain
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:48.160]  produces drugs does it not yes absolutely you're a funny guy it's but it's true your
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:53.240]  brain if you think about it your brain is a pharmaceutical factory i think on just any
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.960]  given day you're probably generating about fifty thousand dollars worth of free drugs
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.100]  in your own head oh way more than that if we had the drugs that we generate in our body
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:06.800]  we're worth trillions yeah trillions well maybe that's how we can pay off the national
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.480]  debt is to turn over our brain drugs we can show up at brain drug donation centers and
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.560]  the u.s can export uh serotonin or something to some other country yeah well they're only
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:21.400]  a few thousand neurotransmitters and we we know about six or eight of them think we got
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:26.200]  the cat's meow there we're so far off base with our antidepressants and anti-anxiety
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.480]  drugs it's a joke smile goes a long way can you imagine them plugging us all in like it's

[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:13.360]  looks at all the things that were that you guys talk about all the time in health care
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:19.280]  that are big problems it looks at the flaws in medical education uh in the big pharmaceutical
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:24.280]  industry uh the world health organization uh systems that have to do with our training
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.880]  that's a problem the medical research industry so it's looking at all the aspects of health
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:34.240]  care that we need to do a lot of reform on true reform we start looking at lifestyle
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.240]  as our as our big approach to healing what do you think about this news a miracle drug
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:44.920]  for multiple sclerosis has been pirated from the cordyceps mushroom and turned into a drug
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:51.160]  that's now being sold for 48 000 per year per patient listen i think that's great business
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:57.120]  they're gonna make a lot of money on that deal first of all just hype it up as to be
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.000]  something it's not probably yeah and then sell it for a lot of money so people want
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.960]  it then go to the government and see if you can work out some kind of relationship so
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:10.280]  that we can get this thing paid for by medicare and insurance companies right man what a deal
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:13.560]  yeah well they're they're making money hand over fist with that when all people really
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:19.840]  need to do is eat the mushroom well you may need a truckload that's the worst thing yeah
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.240]  well it's cordyceps it's got other benefits but isn't this amazing the biopiracy by big

[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:03.040]  know you're just talking the last segment about how what good medicine laughter is you
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.080]  know so we're gonna laugh at the TSA good it's gonna be kind of some dark comedy because
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:11.240]  there's some serious issues here but well they give us all kinds of opportunities for
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:14.720]  satire and comedy that's right that's right you know we've got operation Paul Revere coming
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:20.200]  up and you know ridicule is a really powerful weapon yes you guys did that really well on
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:25.000]  your side I love that TSA video you did a TSA help wanted yeah yeah yeah I felt like
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.440]  right when I saw that you know but yeah the target rich environment and yesterday they
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:32.200]  were in the news with a lot of incredible stuff you know the sequester is coming up
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:37.000]  yep and Janet Napolitano was telling everybody look I'm not trying to scare you I'm just
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.920]  trying to inform you but we're gonna be furloughing people and you're gonna have very long waiting
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:45.320]  times at the airports right right turned out to be a total lie right but two days just
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:52.000]  before that they spent 50 million dollars on new uniforms ah 50 million dollars okay
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.680]  and you know put that in perspective they've got here's some of the numbers they've got
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:03.380]  44,000 employees right so that's eleven hundred and thirty six dollars per uniform wow yeah
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:06.800]  wow where do they where do they buy these eleven hundred dollar TSA uniforms are they
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.080]  magic do they have yeah it's probably make them invisible or something that's right that's
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:15.200]  right yeah they're not bulletproof or waterproof or spill proof you know because they're worried
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.760]  about your liquids I don't know what what it is about it and and it got me thinking
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:23.800]  about well here's here's a serious thing okay first before we get into the other thing okay
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:27.840]  let's be serious all right yeah let's get like the TSA yeah so you know I'm looking
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.900]  at this and it's like okay if they've got 44,000 employees okay there's another article
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:37.160]  saying that their uniform allowance is four hundred and forty six dollars per year for
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:41.420]  these employees wow that's only about forty percent of the cost yeah right so the question
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:47.640]  is are they shoveling this money somewhere else or because this is to be provided over
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:53.520]  a couple years or are they looking to maybe increase the size of the TSA army right oh
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.040]  right add add people two and a half times you know for that that of course maybe they're
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:03.040]  looking at multiple year use of these things or something well I think the the sequestration
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.100]  I think we should instead of cutting people we should cut the uniforms and let the TSA
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:11.720]  up naked and that way we will know that they're not hiding anything in their pants that's
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.800]  right yeah but these little improves want us to be unclothed not them right so apparently
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.600]  special ones and the interesting thing about this and this is in an article a couple of
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:23.040]  these things were in articles that were linked on can you imagine can you imagine those TSA
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:27.700]  agents naked I'm sorry that's a disturbing image there are things you should never do
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:32.480]  never imagine TSA people naked don't pee on the electric fence nothing you know don't
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:37.860]  eat the yellow snow things you should never do basically that's right okay well and also
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:44.000]  here's another serious thing okay this is a marine lieutenant combat lieutenant gets
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:51.640]  $400 once for uniforms okay as an allowance these guys are getting 446 per year wow and
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.440]  they just double that from what they had before but to give you an idea of inflation okay
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.640]  I thought back I started thinking about these little Emperor's running around with their
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.480]  new uniforms and everything it made me think back to the Nixon White House do you remember
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:05.820]  that you remember when Nixon had like the Imperial Guard uniforms that he had at the
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:13.420]  White House I think I was in diapers I remember that they made one appearance okay he'd taken
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:17.480]  a European tour and he was real infatuated with all the pomp and circumstance in Europe
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.520]  right uh-huh so he went out and had uniforms made for the White House staff and and we've
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:25.340]  got it you can't see it on the radio but we've got a got a link to it that we can pull up
[02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:31.440]  here and he got these uniforms for them they wore them only once and they were so ridiculed
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:36.240]  that they never warm again really yeah they were white jackets with black leather caps
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:41.920]  okay and they had I've got something here that talks about but you can look at it they're
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.920]  white and they've got they look like a marching band uniform can you guys show that for prison
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.280]  plan TV members and that's okay those the caps I see the caps yeah that's what they
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:55.720]  actually wound up being they actually wound up being a marching band uniform here's the
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:02.360]  description a white cream tunic made out of elastique with a double-breasted cut three
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:07.880]  buttons a stand-up collar gold nylon trim and a vinyl cap and they had little black
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:12.280]  leather capes with it as well and they had like metal things capes yeah they had on the
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.700]  collars that said wh for White House and all this kind of stuff I think TSA should wear
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:22.360]  capes like Superman running around reaching down your pants with a cape on that's right
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.040]  well they only cost $95 though I mean they got a they got a deal on that's a deal when
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.120]  you look at it I mean they're pretty fancy for $95 of course the feds devalued our currency
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.920]  quite a bit and they intervening 40 years but these are some of the reviews they got
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:39.520]  some of the people said they look like late Weimar Republic other people said they look
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:45.640]  like they're from a Lithuanian movie or they look like Nazi uniforms so they not they mothball
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:50.080]  these things and 10 years later Alice Cooper tried to buy some of them and they wouldn't
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:54.760]  sell really yeah and they eventually gave them to a Utah College where they use them
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.040]  as marching band uniform so I thought you know with all these with all these uniforms
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:02.760]  of the TSA is buying you know at about a hundred people per marching band they could have about
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.480]  500 marching bands they could outfit with these silly uniforms you know it seems to
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:12.560]  me that when you have no real authority you have to have a really fancy uniform mm-hmm
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:16.720]  that's why you know John Cleese did his thing about the Department of funny walks that's
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:21.920]  right it's funny walking and it like the the more corrupt your government the more you
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.960]  have to embellish it with crazy little walks crazy little uniforms mm-hmm because you don't
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:32.120]  have any real authority there all right right this is all a facade and and one of the things
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.000]  that they had to agree to when these this marching band got it they had to agree they
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:41.600]  had a lot of regulations that the Secret Service gave them the Secret Service is very interested
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:46.400]  that they not sell these things to Alice Cooper that they really that they would not use them
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:52.200]  in any way in a way that would debase the presidency okay now I looked at that and I
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.480]  thought well you know the person who debased the presidency was Richard Nixon that kind
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:02.000]  of pride to think that he needed that kind of pump for his personal guards yeah but even
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.060]  think about it though in contrast Richard Nixon didn't even say yeah I can drone strike
[02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:10.960]  Americans on US soil yeah that's right I mean Nixon was a mild compared to what we're seeing
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:14.880]  today he was just kind of getting warmed up you know it's a this tyranny kind of rolls
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:19.080]  out slowly right yeah he was kind of on the cutting edge you know but maybe he was saying
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:22.160]  you know instead of saying I'm not a crook maybe he was saying I'm not a kook you know
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.040]  when he was talking about those forms but it just kind of rolls out but the other thing
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:31.360]  that was interesting I thought with a TSA is you notice that they're going to start
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:35.880]  allowing knives and golf clubs things like that I've been waiting for that yeah I might
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.760]  start flying again if I can bring a knife on now that's two inch blade yeah that's right
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.040]  but now that's only going to be legal in April you know the end of April if you were to carry
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:48.960]  on something like that now you'd be in a lot of trouble so what's the deal do all the TSA
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.480]  people now have enough pocket knives that they've confiscated from everybody and now
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:56.680]  they figure we just can't handle any more freaking knives legalize them again for god's
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:00.840]  sake they've glad the market on knives and nail clippers I guess yeah I don't know well
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:04.980]  the nail clippers there's no word as to whether or not nail clippers are still a security
[02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:11.840]  threat or not so I don't know it's that little file part yeah you could file off the lock
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:17.440]  on the the door that's right to the flight deck that's right and get in that way with
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.040]  your nail clippers yeah what about I heard they were gonna still not allow golf clubs
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.120]  or a certain number of golf clubs or what's the deal on that there was some stuff on this
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:31.560]  it's like they're not gonna allow liquids still okay but you can take lacrosse billiards
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:38.120]  and hockey sticks ski poles and two golf clubs three would be a danger I guess two two one
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:42.760]  for each hand basically is what they're saying you can have two clubs one in each hand that's
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:47.600]  right but the third one now is all totally arbitrary right but the interesting thing
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:51.480]  about you know where they're getting opposition to that from flight attendants flight attendants
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:57.280]  yes yes yeah yeah these people who enforce this kind of bizarre imaginary world on us
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:00.480]  I think that every time you know when they go down they tell you got to turn off your
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:05.500]  cell phones right you can't and they're very explicit about saying that you can't put it
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:10.720]  in airplane mode oh okay now they're right do they actually even understand what airplane
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:16.360]  mode is you know they'd rather you isn't that off exactly well the thing is if you just
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:21.440]  turn it off like they ask you to and make the screen go black yeah okay your your phone
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.080]  is still sending and receiving signals yeah still working as a radio it just doesn't look
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:31.080]  like it okay yeah and so uh but you know if you if you uh actually put it in airplane
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:35.400]  mode that shuts off all radio signals it's not looking for anything it's not sending
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.440]  anything right that's why they call it airplane mode yeah exactly brilliant but that doesn't
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:43.920]  kind of get through to the uh flight attendants you know they they don't really understand
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:47.880]  that and and I guess it kind of gets to the point you know what this is all about it's
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:53.960]  all about theater it's all about appearances sure they want your phone to have the appearance
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:58.040]  of being off even though it's not really well it's like they say don't you can't bring liquids
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:03.480]  on the plane but your body is 75 water right so you know if a terrorist wanted a little
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.160]  liquid bomb all they have to do is swallow a little baggie of liquid go into the bathroom
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.000]  vomit it back up they got their liquid bomb I mean what's the big deal right right or
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:20.380]  or have a fake breast you know uh prosthetic with liquid in it I'm I'm not I'm sure I'm
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:23.920]  not giving terrorists new ideas these are kind of obvious things right right this liquid
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:28.720]  thing is crazy well it's been security theater for a long time everybody's known it's been
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:35.160]  theater I I flew with my sons uh in 2001 before September 11th and I told him I said this
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:40.820]  is just the stupidest theater that you've ever seen this is all about you know a power
[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:45.100]  trip it's all about uh making people think that the government is there to protect them
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:48.240]  that the government is going to save them and keep them secure and just a few months
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.900]  after that you know you had 9-11 remember that show that comedy improv show called whose
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:57.160]  line is it anyway uh no I don't remember that really that was that was I remember seeing
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:01.880]  that and it was it was set up improv situations I found that this was useful every time before
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:07.360]  I would go into the airport I would imagine I'm going to view a whose line is it anyway
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:12.720]  show where they're acting like security experts and then there's the TSA oh my god it's so
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:18.360]  funny yeah yeah that's right well it's uh it's sad but it's kind of like a dark comedy
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:24.280]  you know it's kind of like Terry Gilliam's Brazil yeah remember how he had they had all
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:27.360]  the monitors where they're watching everybody and all the stuff you know it's just real
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:31.320]  oppressive and brutal regime but it doesn't really quite work no it doesn't it doesn't
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:38.380]  work massive failures and I've I've wondered too how does the TSA train itself to feel
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:44.440]  down your pants do they pat each other down and to get good at it do they work on dummy
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:48.520]  models how do they do that because they're experts I don't want to try to visualize that
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:53.460]  yeah me neither well anyway more more satire at the TSA's expense straight ahead right
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:20:11.400]  here on the Alex Jones show with David Knight in studio stay with us we'll be right back.

[02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:20.160]  Alright we're back on the Alex Jones show thanks for listening in this is the third
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:26.560]  hour of today's broadcast on this Wednesday still Wednesday March 6th 2013 Mike Adams
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:31.320]  filling in here with David Knight in studio and we're talking about the TSA actually we're
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.640]  making fun of the TSA but what do you what do you think about the notion David that when
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:43.760]  you go on a flight you are in effect submitting to be a prisoner for the entire duration from
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:47.720]  when you check in to when you get off the plane you're a prisoner oh yeah absolutely
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:50.760]  it's a police state and it's a silly police state like I was talking about you know they
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:55.320]  don't really understand even how cell phones work right and you stop and think about it
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.240]  that that's another thing too about the 9-11 narrative I mean if you understand how cell
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:04.320]  phones work you know that nobody was calling and talking to somebody at a call station
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:09.440]  right a long time right it's such an obvious hole in the official story right right if
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:13.520]  anybody's ever tried to make a cell phone call from yeah phone they pretty much know
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:18.600]  that because the cell phone towers are evident in a pattern that deliberately is focusing
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:25.440]  the energy horizontally vertically right okay and you'll be passing through the cell phone
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.760]  cells so quickly that they couldn't switch to keep up with you right so I mean there's
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:33.880]  a lot of different issues here but yeah it just doesn't work and that's why they put
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:39.440]  Wi-Fi and they put phone service on the planes because your phones and your Wi-Fi doesn't
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:44.480]  work on a plane but you know it's the whole thing is silly from the start to the finish
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.680]  and like we were talking about during the break we just don't travel that much anymore
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:53.240]  we try to avoid it you you know you avoid it totally I've got family still in North
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:58.680]  Carolina so I can't completely avoid it and I've done more traveling in the last few months
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:05.480]  and I've done in decade well the thing is I I would love to have an airline called open
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:10.720]  carry airlines yeah where to get on the plane you got to bring a gun that's right because
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:17.120]  I mean that I would I I'd be on there with veterans and cops FBI agents and concealed
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.000]  carry citizens I'd bring my Glock we should all be armed you think a terrorist is going
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.280]  to get on a plane like that no no way I mean the only requirement you got to bring a frangible
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:31.720]  ammo that's it they check your ammo at the gate here frangible ammo get on the plane
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:35.880]  be the safest plane in the sky that'll that'll never happen because remember they they when
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:40.420]  they had they banned cigarette smoking yeah right okay which I agree with I don't want
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:43.920]  to breathe other people's smoke on the plane right I don't either but some people talked
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:47.240]  about you know having plane flights where they were just going to be all smoking oh
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:51.760]  yeah they can have that sure you know they won't allow that right yeah they used to have
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.320]  before they did that you had some airlines I remember there was one airline that used
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:01.880]  to have a Texas run called Muse Air it was a spin-off some executives from Southwest
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:06.800]  and they had flights where there was no smoking you know for these short flights so they knew
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:10.520]  there was a market for people who didn't want smoking well there was also a market for people
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:15.960]  who wanted smoking all the time right right they won't allow even that it's just the way
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:20.080]  the nanny state is I'm all about choice you know if you want to have if you want to smoke
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:23.920]  on the airplane that's fine you want to have a smoke an all-smoking flight they should
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:29.160]  allow that mm-hmm well I mean look at look at Bloomberg's nanny state in New York right
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.960]  you know you can't smoke inside your barbershop right so they've had some guys actually get
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.360]  loitering tickets for going outside of their own barbershop while they're waiting for somebody
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.200]  to come in they go outside their own barbershop and light up a cigarette and stand there in
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.080]  front of their barbershop and then the cop gives them a ticket for loitering that's crazy
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:51.080]  oh yes New York I I think New York should have a department of mental hygiene like we
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:56.000]  have in Maryland now I just learned today it's a department of mental hygiene do you
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.840]  think Bloomberg could pass the inspection yeah well no see but that's the thing you
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:04.440]  notice they don't give drug tests to members of Congress you don't even have to pass a
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:09.240]  constitutional proficiency test to get into the Senate right right you don't even have
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:12.520]  to know what the Bill of Rights is at all and for all we know they can't read right
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:15.880]  because maybe they can obviously read the bills yeah they have to pass them to find
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:20.180]  out what's in them I think half of them are psyched psyched out on psyched drugs I think
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:24.300]  they're on you know all kinds of drugs that inhibit their cognitive function we should
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:28.720]  drug test Congress that's what I'm saying yeah well there's also that you know that
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:33.240]  green money that you know kind of messes up the way they think too you know yeah the something
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:39.760]  of a drug to them the ultimate addiction yeah cash that's right they definitely go for that
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:44.360]  $100,000 per vote but have you ever noticed getting back to airplanes that pilots treat
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.520]  you on the airplane the same way that the White House treats the press it's like you're
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:53.840]  sitting on the runway something's broken on the plane something's obviously broken the
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:59.560]  wing is falling off the pilots like yeah we're doing a routine check up here we're gonna be
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:03.080]  sitting here for a few minutes and they always blame it on the control tower that's right
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:08.160]  the control tower told us to waste six hours of your time that's right it's the control
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:12.400]  towers fault that's right there's never any problem here right yeah that's isn't that
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:16.800]  Obama though there's never any problem yeah oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah we don't have
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:21.320]  we got a sequestration problem but you know we can still spend 50 million dollars on uniforms
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:25.360]  and we can send 250 million dollars to Egypt or whatever I mean it's they can find the
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:31.040]  money to do what they want to do but they're gonna release criminals onto the streets to
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:36.260]  threaten the population yeah at the same time is that's that's what they do well it's incredible

[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:11.780]  right now in the united states in 2013 well we're gonna turn this around folks and coming
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:17.980]  at you from the headquarters of the organization infowars that is spearheading the effort to
[02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.980]  turn this around this is the alex jones show mike adams filling in today aaron dykes now
[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:29.740]  joins us in studio with updated information some some good stuff from aaron and to start
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:34.900]  off with what's going on with ran paul and his attempted filibuster right now well as
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:39.000]  you know they put forward john brennan one of obama's key advisors who actually creates
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.180]  the drone kill list and brings it to obama's desk each week he's being nominated for cia
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:48.820]  and so ran paul is filibustering right now in the senate that nomination and saying he
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:53.140]  wants the obama administration to promise not to kill american drones we've got a report
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:58.780]  up on infowars government emergency alert test interrupts the ran paul filibuster that's
[02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:05.060]  interesting because of all the sneaky tactics we saw during the ron paul run for the campaign
[02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:09.780]  all the blacking out in the media uh sometimes physically blacking out the transmission of
[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:14.380]  his speech it's interesting that the state of new york would issue an eas alert over
[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:18.920]  his filibuster right though i have also seen it on cnn but interesting he's doing that
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:24.540]  just to interrupt things but you know why wouldn't the obama just say okay we're not
[02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:30.260]  gonna kill americans on u.s soil why wouldn't he just be willing to put that language in
[02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:34.620]  there if that's what he's claiming he's never gonna do oh well look at the whole structure
[02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:39.260]  they've created uh the new terrorist could be a domestic extremist might be a returning
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:43.760]  vet might just be a crazy constitutionalist with a flag might just be a curmudgeon old
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:48.520]  man with a shotgun who doesn't want government putting in a spark meter or something it might
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:54.540]  be an eight-year-old student with a strawberry tart shaped like a gun that's most dangerous
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:59.060]  actually we're about to get to a special report at the very end oh really i caught a very
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:03.520]  young terrorist still in a stroller with a bubble gun that's that's not gonna work out
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:08.560]  but he was just rapid firing he had bubbles he had hundreds of uh bubble bullets in his
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:13.340]  chamber does the tsa allow bubble guns on airplanes anymore or ever that's probably
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:18.580]  liquid right i doubt oh that's a liquid the bubbles plus it might look like something
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:23.200]  you know yeah like bubbles well i'm really worried about the strawberry tart guns because
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.060]  they could shoot strawberry seeds which i i understand are quite small and could poke
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:34.940]  out an eye and it's part of this whole orwellian 1984 big brother system where the perception
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:41.300]  is reality and everyone has to tattle on each other and yeah basically even the thought
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:46.420]  they had literal everything but literal invasion of the mind but any sign that you're thinking
[02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:50.340]  of resistance that itself is a crime that's a thought crime well that gets us to the issue
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:55.020]  of mental hygiene yeah which we mentioned that in the first hour freaked me out but
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:59.260]  yeah yeah go ahead mental hygiene but that is one of the key code words from the eugenics
[02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:04.140]  movement it goes back to the founding but basically they wanted to use the idea that
[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:09.140]  there's crazy people and they might be reproducing faster than regular people no mentally unfit
[02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:14.140]  people what they called feeble minded people but most of this was code word of course there
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:18.620]  were some messed up people but they really wanted an excuse for the state to decide who
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:23.600]  lives and dies which really brings us up to modern day uh socialized health care where
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:28.100]  they want to rationalize it and say well your end of life care might cost a million dollars
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:33.340]  plus that's not worth it your life isn't a value so we want to terminate you that abortions
[02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:38.140]  to a minority mother or someone who already has too many children so that life isn't worth
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:43.780]  it and that's very much the mentality of eugenics but it itself is part of what george orwell
[02:37:43.780 --> 02:37:50.320]  actually calls oligarchical collectivism remember goldstein the rebel in 1984 who actually helped
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:55.540]  establish that big brother system he writes the book on the theory and practice of oligarchical
[02:37:55.540 --> 02:38:01.340]  collectivism and what this is is socialism in disguise uh have you ever heard of the
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:06.280]  fabian society runs fabian socialism yeah they have two logos one is the turtle for
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.500]  incrementalism the other is a wolf in sheep's clothing oh really and just check out one
[02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:16.500]  of the main of fabian socialists who was also a eugenicist was playwright george bernard
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:22.020]  shaw very famous for pygmalion and some of his other works he wrote that under socialism
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:27.680]  which remembers any form of oligarchical collectivism run by the elites but where everyone's trapped
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:34.020]  in the society socialism you'd be forcibly fed clothed lodged taught and employed whether
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:38.380]  you liked it or not but if it were discovered you had not the character and industry to
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:43.020]  be worth all this trouble you might be executed in a kindly manner in a kindly manner and
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:47.300]  so that is that a drone strike system is that new world order system in action i think the
[02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:52.580]  drone strikes are are kindly because the missile arrives before you hear it therefore there
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:57.900]  is no fear involved because they fly faster than the speed of sound right so you're blown
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:03.180]  up before you can even sense it that's compassionate government oh it's compassionate yeah but
[02:39:03.180 --> 02:39:08.980]  just to get back into eugenics and mental hygiene uh you had the case in i believe 1927
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:13.940]  where they were saying we have to sterilize these imbeciles these feeble-minded uh retarded
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:18.680]  minds who can't think for themselves and there's actually a supreme court ruling from justice
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:23.980]  oliver window holmes who wrote in the in the deciding uh principle at the time quote the
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:30.180]  principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:37.520]  tubes which of course is compulsory sterilization and he said say in that decision three generations
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:42.020]  of imbeciles is enough and that's completely in fitting with why they have established
[02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:47.980]  departments of health and mental hygiene which are implements of the eugenics movement wow
[02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:53.600]  and it completely fits in where the rockefeller family pushed all the vehicles for eugenics
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.940]  but also established our modern uh science and our modern hospitals and our modern health
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:03.700]  care system the allopathic medicine where you have to have surgeries and pharmaceuticals
[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:08.300]  for everything uh staying away from anything that can't be trademarked and found in nature
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:14.900]  basically well if this eugenics effort was was thrust upon us you know many generations
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:22.200]  ago and it was so intense it seems like it didn't work because we we have more we have
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:27.040]  i mean we have it seems like the people running the country are now the most intellectually
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:32.100]  you know cognitively impaired of all it's like they got an instead of eugenics was saying
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:36.740]  they want to kill people who don't have high iq's but now it's like let's let's make them
[02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:41.580]  let's put them in office high iq's and mental capacity was the language of eugenics the
[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:46.780]  actual system was about classifying people into into classes i mean they wanted to protect
[02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:52.180]  the elites and propagate their dominance right have an excuse to eliminate their competition
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:56.700]  and in particular many of them are racist and wanted to keep the black population down
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:41:01.900]  you later saw the population council the united nations population fund doing really heavy
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:07.400]  handed family planning in the third world where they do the most brutal things to people
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.740]  in india and china and all these other third world developing nations yeah you know north
[02:41:11.740 --> 02:41:16.420]  korea will give you a nuclear family they're working they're working on that i know technology
[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:21.680]  but listen the main idea sorry i i just have to i'm sorry i can't be serious today aaron
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:28.740]  it's just it's too insane for me alex calls it gallows humor but uh you know so what is
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:31.820]  what do you think from your research because you researched this more than anybody i know
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:37.260]  what is the ultimate mechanism for population control that they're going to rain down upon
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:41.500]  us now or is it already here with gmo's and vaccines i think that's one of the main vehicles
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:46.260]  for sure the soft kill you've got technocrats like uh bill gates on the cutting edge of
[02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:51.460]  that he's pushing worldwide with mind you the rockefeller foundation they're working
[02:41:51.460 --> 02:41:58.700]  in lockstep to push vaccines everywhere some of which carry covert uh birth control maneuvers
[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:03.940]  terminating pregnancies causing miscarriages causing infertility and then he the other
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:10.300]  side he's pushing very heavy-handedly gmo's he's got major monsanto stock companies like
[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:15.260]  mcdonald's and so forth are interlocked with his holdings and with the board of directories
[02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:20.620]  with monsanto and that again works with rockefeller who in the 70s created what they called the
[02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:27.340]  green revolution but it also centralized food production well you mentioned vaccines vaccines
[02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:33.740]  are birth control i mean vaccines are abortions they cause spontaneous abortions right and
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:39.700]  so do gmo's yeah in the rat studies that's fine right so the technologies isn't bill
[02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:43.980]  gates in town here in austin right now that yeah he's here today for south by southwest
[02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:49.900]  i think is he uh is he is he feeding people gmo what's he doing is he handing out cheeseburgers
[02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:54.900]  a lot of that yeah yeah you know those elites they don't eat gmo's themselves they have
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:43:00.040]  they're very meticulous the rockefeller family owns their own personal organic farm has their
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:05.020]  own personal organic chefs who prepare food and supply their personal family of food you
[02:43:05.020 --> 02:43:09.480]  find the same kind of thing with chinese elites uh with the queen the royal families bill
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:13.820]  gates these people don't eat what they're pushing to the mainstream uh put that put
[02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:17.500]  that back on guys check this out here's the news melissa melton story on infowars.com
[02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:23.880]  bill gates descends on austin in controlled pre-planned appearance well i mean versus
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:30.940]  what a spontaneous that's uh but uh bill gates is going to be at the dell computer science
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:37.080]  hall at the university of texas speaking to students no doubt telling them to abort their
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:41.920]  babies with more vaccines well hey let's show the media because uh alex really wanted me
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.180]  to get to this special report oh i'm sorry yeah go and go for it public events seeing
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:50.660]  uh national guard texas state guard popping up all over the place they were at the kite
[02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:55.140]  festival which is otherwise this happy family event alex solemn at a texas independence
[02:43:55.140 --> 02:44:00.500]  day celebration they'll do crowd control parking street control at different events and the
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:05.100]  question is why and the bottom line i tried to point out the history in the special report
[02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:09.380]  but they've perverted what was supposed to be our state militias and allowed them to
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:14.380]  be over federalized and used by the president and the centralized federalized government
[02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:18.720]  branch because they had one loophole in the constitution for when you could use military
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:24.060]  domestically on our soil and that was to repel invasions and to put down insurrections they
[02:44:24.060 --> 02:44:27.140]  were thinking about things like the shays rebellion that happened after the revolution
[02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:32.980]  but before the constitution but in our modern day they've perverted that loophole over insurrections
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:38.580]  and used it to be any national emergency natural disasters terrorism incidents hurricane and
[02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:43.900]  so under us north com and under laws they've passed including john moore defense act since
[02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:49.180]  that time they've transformed more and more of the state guards as well as the national
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:53.580]  guard into federal hands and allow the president to take total control okay let's merge it
[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:59.220]  so let's roll it let's roll it erin dykes here for info wars dot com we've got to ask
[02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:04.100]  ourselves why are the feds preparing for a war against americans why have they bought
[02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:11.020]  now more than two billion bullets all kinds of arms and ammunition and now more than 2700
[02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:15.500]  tanks to patrol in america and keep order we're told it's because they love us we're
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:21.500]  told it's to keep the peace and to increase safety but of course we also know from army
[02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:27.120]  documents from homeland security reports and a lot of other information that it's really
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:32.700]  to occupy america and prepare for a civil unrest and a total economic collapse that
[02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:37.260]  will include gun confiscation gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state
[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:41.920]  of emergency following hurricane katrina and new orleans now the founders who set up the
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.580]  constitution and bill of rights did not want a standing army because they knew history
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:52.100]  and they knew that over and over again that's how power corrupts and takes over societies
[02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:56.440]  at the same time they were concerned about historical examples like the shays rebellion
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:01.300]  that happened after the years of the revolution but before the constitution where soldiers
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:07.000]  who weren't paid formed mobs to try to take over the government so they put in the possibility
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:13.100]  for the army to be used domestically for only one purpose and that's to put down insurrections
[02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:19.580]  this was strengthened through things like posse commentatis from 1878 strictly forbidding
[02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:23.920]  military from working with police or doing domestic operations but that has whittled
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:30.620]  away in recent years and there's been a concerted effort to do away with posse commentatis altogether
[02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:36.180]  and to take away the state's power over troops and national guards and put all the power
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.820]  in the hands of the feds homeland security and the department of defense we've of course
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:46.060]  seen how the military has been drilling preparing and training to take on americans put them
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:51.780]  in internment camps and otherwise occupy the domestic sphere of society alex documented
[02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:56.660]  as early as his police state 2000 film and in many of his other films here's a short
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:47:00.780]  clip where americans come to checkpoints and beg for help from the military
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:28.140]  but it's a no way limit to the things that alex has just put in his films this has been
[02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:33.600]  an ongoing effort that has been accelerating david knight did a special report just a few
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:39.520]  weeks ago documenting only a few of the recent urban warfare drills many of which included
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:46.540]  helicopters firing simulated live rounds over major american cities they include houston
[02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:53.860]  miami minneapolis st louis chicago los angeles and other locales well let's take a look at
[02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:58.900]  some of these recent drills january the 28th in houston helicopters and the sound of gunfire
[02:47:58.900 --> 02:48:03.340]  created a lot of concern this afternoon in one houston neighborhood and an army major
[02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:07.580]  who was out here wouldn't tell us exactly what kind of training they were doing miami
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:13.140]  four days earlier january the 24th 2013 still if you've seen one of these drills it really
[02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:18.020]  is like a scene out of one of those action movies choppers stalking the sky in downtown
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:22.780]  miami it's a joint military training exercise and here's another one in minneapolis august
[02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:29.520]  28 2012 if you see military helicopters flying low over minneapolis do not be alarmed they
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:35.940]  are training in an urban environment here's another one st louis july 3rd 2012 it's a
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:41.140]  military mission in north st louis heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and
[02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:46.200]  while they come in peace there are all kinds of rumors about why they are here chicago
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:52.740]  april 17 2012 a pretty scary scene along the chicago river turns out to be a military
[02:48:52.740 --> 02:49:00.980]  training exercise los angeles and january the 26th 2012 special military operation forces
[02:49:00.980 --> 02:49:06.500]  in conjunction with the lapd conducting some military maneuvers of course in the 2010 film
[02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:11.540]  police state 4 the rise of fema rob do alex jones and the other filmmakers covered the
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:17.660]  example of arcadia iowa where the national guard practiced cordon and search drills in
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:24.100]  neighborhoods to specifically take on gun dealers to find quote weapons caches and alex
[02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:28.540]  interviewed the officer who's in charge of the drill they were admittedly doing it for
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:33.580]  domestic purposes inside the united states and we should really ask ourselves why it
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:38.540]  says in this article going door to door asking if they could search homes looking for weapons
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:45.140]  it's actually a planned training event to provide our soldiers with greater proficiency
[02:49:45.140 --> 02:49:50.940]  at what we call cordon and search uh which is a mission that um just for a little background
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:56.500]  we've deployed nearly 13 000 members of the iowa national guard in the global war on terror
[02:49:56.500 --> 02:50:01.660]  and then actually search for caches of weapons or other kinds of contraband which could harm
[02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:07.660]  um american forces another like fallujah what we saw in fallujah correct and then you have
[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:16.060]  manuals like fm 3-39.40 specifically about internment and resettlement and they include
[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:21.860]  the presence of psyop officers to win over the support of the american people and of
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:25.940]  course to deal with dissidents and this happens throughout history every time an oppressive
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:31.500]  power takes over the nazis of course didn't only come in with a strong military force
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:36.860]  they first sent in what equates to psyop officers psychological operators who tried
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:41.900]  to win over public support they offered children candy they told them they were there to help
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:46.700]  they did friendly public events and we see this playing out again in american society
[02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:52.140]  unfortunately where national guard military troops who aren't supposed to operate domestically
[02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:57.580]  are operating outside of their role but in benign ways that innocuous events to win over
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:04.820]  public support and this too if you're listening you know your basic freedoms are being threatened
[02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:09.560]  every day if you're listening you know the economy is not getting better you know gas

[02:54:45.980 --> 02:54:51.580]  and recreation what could be better but outside of this festive atmosphere which had clogged
[02:54:51.580 --> 02:54:56.760]  downtown traffic and brought normal activities on this happy weekend day to a halt was a
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:02.820]  military presence the texas state guard operating under the national guard was running part
[02:55:02.820 --> 02:55:07.420]  of the event they were invited there by the austin exchange club and operated with the
[02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:12.860]  help of police the shuttle buses bringing kite festival goers to and from the event
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:18.700]  it was admittedly run as other training exercises are in preparation for natural disasters and
[02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:24.220]  other emergencies as coordinated by homeland security and fema including this article posted
[02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:29.580]  on the texas state guard website txsg flies high with austin kite festival where they
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:34.720]  admit in part that festival organizers and participants gave the texas state guard soldiers
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:39.820]  real world training for the kind of logistical support the organization provides during natural
[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:44.860]  disasters and other emergencies quote this gives us the opportunity to put our training
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:50.260]  and expertise into practical use in advance of our response to hurricanes tornadoes floods
