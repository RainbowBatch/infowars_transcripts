[00:00.000 --> 00:14.840]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14.840 --> 00:19.800]  Wednesday, March 27th, 2019.
[00:19.800 --> 00:24.440]  And the Mueller report coming up empty is even more devastating to the deep state and
[00:24.440 --> 00:30.600]  the globalist media combined than I thought they are in ratings total implosion freefall.
[00:30.600 --> 00:35.320]  Their credibility already close to zero has now gone negative.
[00:35.320 --> 00:42.080]  The small arrogance, because it goes all the way up to Obama, the arrogance of the system
[00:42.080 --> 00:49.840]  letting him off, Scott Free, is now spiraling completely out of control, blowing up in their
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.600]  face as their hubris and arrogance meets reality.
[00:54.600 --> 00:58.760]  But first, we've seen a lot of compilations of the Russiagate fail, but here's one of
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.160]  the biggest and most extensive and newest that we've posted to InfoWars.com.
[01:03.160 --> 01:04.160]  Breaking news.
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.160]  Oh my God.
[01:05.160 --> 01:06.760]  Oh, breaking news.
[01:06.760 --> 01:09.840]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting.
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.440]  Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.720]  that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians.
[01:19.720 --> 01:36.440]  I'm confident now even more so than I have been throughout the last year that this nightmare
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.520]  presidency of Donald John Trump will end prematurely and soon.
[01:40.520 --> 01:48.400]  If we discover that Donald Trump are his advocates, played a role in helping to devise strategy,
[01:48.400 --> 01:55.480]  if they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary, I think that is something that would
[01:55.480 --> 01:59.400]  put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached.
[01:59.400 --> 02:05.200]  It supposedly happened in 2013, the year Trump hosted the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.920]  The bombshell burst Tuesday evening when CNN reported the president-elect and President
[02:10.920 --> 02:14.160]  Obama were briefed on the matter last week.
[02:14.160 --> 02:20.400]  The report included unsubstantiated claims that Russian intelligence compiled a dossier
[02:20.400 --> 02:23.800]  on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.040]  He dismissed outright the very idea that he would take part in the sorted acts described
[02:29.040 --> 02:30.040]  in the report.
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.040]  He denied everything.
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.320]  He called it all fake news.
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.360]  The 35-page dossier on the so-called Russian connection to Trump with some very salacious
[02:37.360 --> 02:43.080]  allegations including unsubstantiated claims about Trump in a Moscow hotel room was not
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.760]  completed until just before the election and then provided to journalists, the Clinton
[02:47.760 --> 02:49.720]  campaign and the FBI.
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.080]  It claims that Donald Trump once visited Russia, stayed in the Ritz Carlton in Moscow and then
[02:56.080 --> 03:01.520]  hired prostitutes to perform a golden shower and that Russia might have the whole thing
[03:01.520 --> 03:02.520]  on tape.
[03:02.520 --> 03:10.040]  There were surveillance cameras in this room because the building is wired and that the
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.600]  FSB has this because they automatically have cameras in the room and they caught this happening.
[03:14.600 --> 03:18.720]  Donald Trump engaged in perverted acts with prostitutes.
[03:18.720 --> 03:20.560]  Trump immediately denied the report.
[03:20.560 --> 03:22.960]  I'd like to ask you about your big Russian pee-pee party.
[03:22.960 --> 03:25.760]  No, no, I am not talking about the pee-pee.
[03:25.760 --> 03:28.760]  Because it didn't happen.
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.480]  From there, the president-elect lit into the news media again.
[03:32.480 --> 03:33.720]  He condemned BuzzFeed.
[03:33.720 --> 03:40.240]  There's a failing pile of garbage writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences
[03:40.240 --> 03:41.240]  they already are.
[03:41.240 --> 03:46.920]  And he accused CNN of being fake news and brushed off persistent attempts by its correspondent
[03:46.920 --> 03:48.960]  to ask a question.
[03:48.960 --> 03:55.640]  Later CNN's parent company Time Warner defended its reporting and BuzzFeed said it published
[03:55.640 --> 03:57.880]  what it called a newsworthy document.
[03:57.880 --> 04:03.120]  It claims Trump set out to defile the suite because President Obama and the first family
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.960]  had once stayed there and Trump, quote, hated the Obamas.
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.560]  Everything that I had written in the months prior to that dossier coming out was almost
[04:14.560 --> 04:17.960]  identical to what the CIA had written because we're intelligence officers.
[04:17.960 --> 04:19.400]  This is what we do.
[04:19.400 --> 04:24.280]  That corroboration, based on intercepted communications, has given U.S. intelligence
[04:24.280 --> 04:29.520]  and law enforcement, quote, greater confidence in the credibility of some aspects of the
[04:29.520 --> 04:30.520]  dossier.
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.960]  Both salacious and unverified claims are that the Russian Secret Service, or FSB, secretly
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.240]  filmed Mr. Trump with prostitutes in this Moscow hotel room three years ago.
[04:41.240 --> 04:44.240]  Allegations the special counsel continues to investigate, George.
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.200]  And so far it is us as American citizens, it is us in the press who are connected to
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.200]  the dossier.
[04:49.200 --> 04:50.200]  All right, folks.
[04:50.200 --> 04:56.760]  I've got to tell you, I think that's probably the ultimate mainstream media Russia delusion
[04:56.760 --> 05:00.280]  failure compilation.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.040]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.200]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.520]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[05:13.520 --> 05:17.120]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.480]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[05:19.480 --> 05:25.640]  But the truth is, it is we, the people, and our ideas, and our actions, and what we say
[05:25.640 --> 05:31.880]  and what we do that changes the world, we are the power structure, we are the inventors,
[05:31.880 --> 05:37.080]  we are the trailblazers, and the globalists understand that.
[05:37.080 --> 05:42.360]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from
[05:42.360 --> 05:43.360]  we the people.
[05:43.360 --> 05:48.880]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[05:48.880 --> 05:53.120]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[05:53.120 --> 05:58.120]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50%offinforestore.com,
[05:58.120 --> 06:25.840]  something everybody should take advantage of.
