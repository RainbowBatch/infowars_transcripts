[00:00.000 --> 00:19.320]  British TV, UK TV, Australian TV, and Canadian news, looking at the great reset for what
[00:19.320 --> 00:20.320]  it is.
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.200]  A world government corporate takeover where they're exempt from the taxes and the regulations,
[00:24.200 --> 00:29.280]  nobody else is, and then everybody from small farms to small factories to power plants
[00:29.280 --> 00:30.280]  get shut down.
[00:30.280 --> 00:34.440]  There's a big difference between investment and ownership.
[00:34.440 --> 00:41.240]  My objection in the past has been to selling out our water to very vital commodities, just
[00:41.240 --> 00:46.280]  as we've seen in relation to our telecommunications or indeed in relation to our agriculture,
[00:46.280 --> 00:47.280]  our dairy industry.
[00:47.280 --> 00:51.880]  So because we've sold the dairy industry completely virtually to China, they're getting fresh
[00:51.880 --> 00:57.480]  milk, they're getting powdered milk, that's precisely what our families need.
[00:57.480 --> 01:02.840]  Well another warning sign is any organisation with the term world in their name.
[01:02.840 --> 01:06.440]  And of course we shouldn't forget the World Trade Organisation.
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.280]  With lofty goals, espousing free trade, its real mission seems not to be holding China
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.520]  to the same integrity requirements as the rest of the world when it comes to intellectual
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.720]  property protection, trade tariffs and barriers, etc.
[01:22.720 --> 01:28.560]  In goodness it has the goal to reduce inequality, which is socialist speak for taking from the
[01:28.560 --> 01:32.400]  productive and giving to the non-productive.
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.920]  Someone needs to tell them about history, it shows it never works.
[01:36.920 --> 01:42.200]  The great reset, this is the plan by the World Economic Forum to encourage governments to
[01:42.200 --> 01:49.160]  use all the levers they use during lockdown, enforced business closures, 23 hour lockdowns,
[01:49.160 --> 01:54.400]  restricting how far you can go from your home and ridiculously aggressive policing tactics
[01:54.400 --> 01:58.720]  in order to tackle climate change.
[01:58.720 --> 02:03.600]  The Guardian last week ran a lengthy and to be frank fairly tedious article by someone
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.760]  I've never heard of called Ann Davies attacking me, it seems to be my week, for spreading
[02:08.760 --> 02:15.760]  conspiracy theories about the great reset accompanied by a photo of myself looking suitably deranged
[02:15.760 --> 02:17.480]  and unhinged.
[02:17.480 --> 02:22.560]  Because Davies clearly doesn't understand what a conspiracy theory is, there is no secret
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.600]  agenda about the great reset, they're shouting it from the rafters, it's not me saying they
[02:28.600 --> 02:55.160]  want you to own nothing and be happy about it, it's them.
