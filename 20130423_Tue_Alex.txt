[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:22.880]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.880 --> 00:35.600]  It is Tuesday, the 23rd day of April, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going
[00:35.600 --> 00:43.160]  to be live here in, Lord's willing, three hours. Well, where to start? You know, globally,
[00:43.160 --> 00:49.320]  they're pushing for national and global Internet sales taxes and also money transfer taxes.
[00:49.320 --> 00:55.160]  Basically, any type of online activity taxes, which also doubles as surveillance. And the
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.400]  IRS already says it's the regulations that you're supposed to report to them every online
[01:01.400 --> 01:02.400]  transaction you make.
[01:02.400 --> 01:06.960]  And you're supposed to report all your medical records and whether you have insurance or
[01:06.960 --> 01:14.280]  not to the IRS. It is to be the grand controller of everything you do with the Fifth Amendment
[01:14.280 --> 01:21.180]  in the ash heap of history. And now Internet sales tax advances after Obama endorsement.
[01:21.180 --> 01:27.760]  Notice suddenly they pass CISPA in the house, Internet tracking, taxing, control system.
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.340]  Hundreds of billions of dollars to big defense contractors to spy on you and your family.
[01:32.340 --> 01:38.840]  We're talking 10 million contracts, $10 billion contracts per company with just dozens and
[01:38.840 --> 01:45.080]  dozens of them getting $2 billion, $15 billion, $10 billion, just off the chart gang raping.
[01:45.080 --> 01:51.520]  So you pay to be gang raped. And now they want the feds to basically administer the
[01:51.520 --> 01:59.240]  delivery of sales tax to the states and, of course, administrative fees for the feds.
[01:59.240 --> 02:05.080]  This is absolutely unbelievable, but it's what you, of course, have to expect. And they
[02:05.080 --> 02:10.920]  try to play off small businesses against people saying, well, brick and mortar is in trouble
[02:10.920 --> 02:16.920]  because of this. No, brick and mortar is in trouble because of the fact that America has
[02:16.920 --> 02:21.480]  been deindustrialized and the economy is being turned off.
[02:21.480 --> 02:29.200]  And brick and mortar is in trouble because of the fact that they haven't been competitive.
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.280]  That's the issue. Brick and mortar that is competitive is very, very successful. Look
[02:34.280 --> 02:38.080]  at Apple stores with their brick and mortar and bringing in the slave goods. People wanna
[02:38.080 --> 02:42.280]  go in, they wanna talk, they wanna find out their special deals when you go in.
[02:42.280 --> 02:45.840]  There's all sorts of other little mom and pop operations that are successful because
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.900]  of one word, service. But this is the classic thing like they did back in the 20s. These
[02:51.900 --> 02:56.960]  trucks are driving on roads you pay for, and they're commercial. They're making money.
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.600]  Let's come up with driver's license, commercial license, and tax them to drive cuz they're
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.640]  making money off what you pay for. Well, those truck drivers pay taxes too. Those companies
[03:05.640 --> 03:06.960]  pay taxes too.
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.240]  You just end up paying in the price of the goods for the taxes they've gotta pay. And
[03:11.240 --> 03:16.840]  then they extend driving as a privilege, which it's not, on to everybody else. And hence
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.720]  the fraud of driver's license by the 50s that are paper licenses and now biometric national
[03:22.720 --> 03:29.540]  ID cards. So we're gonna be going over all of that today. And then of course the big
[03:29.540 --> 03:33.360]  news, it's up at DrudgeReport.com in the middle column.
[03:33.360 --> 03:42.120]  It is a Steve Watson article. Boston, residents ordered out of their homes at gunpoint by
[03:42.120 --> 03:48.120]  SWAT teams. And we have the photos and videos. In fact, I've had Kurt Nemo add some photos,
[03:48.120 --> 03:55.400]  or he's adding them right now, that citizens took and sent us, of police and military pointing
[03:55.400 --> 04:00.040]  guns at people in their front yards and in their windows.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.400]  And taking women out of the houses, and then the woman puts her hands down, so they push
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.680]  her or shove her. There's video of that, and Bloomberg is coming out saying, this is the
[04:09.680 --> 04:19.340]  new way, we've gotta get rid of the Constitution. But it's official, the Wall Street Journal
[04:19.340 --> 04:25.960]  declares the USA to be a battlefield. And that means martial law suspending your due
[04:25.960 --> 04:31.680]  process for the banker rendering of the nation.
[04:31.680 --> 04:36.400]  Here's the Daily Mail, the controversial moment SWAT teams ordered innocent neighbors out
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.120]  of their houses at gunpoint during door to door searches for the Boston bomber. It's
[04:40.120 --> 04:46.160]  not controversial. This was the suspension of rights, this went on citywide. Bloomberg
[04:46.160 --> 04:49.560]  says interpretation of Constitution will have to change after Boston bombing. See,
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.120]  it's not just the Second Amendment he wants, he wants it all. We're gonna be breaking that
[04:54.120 --> 05:02.240]  down and the latest on what is clearly a Patsy set up false flag.
[05:02.240 --> 05:08.500]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal

[07:00.460 --> 07:05.680]  over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good size
[07:05.680 --> 07:10.840]  meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the
[07:10.840 --> 07:14.740]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[07:14.740 --> 07:20.840]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[07:20.840 --> 07:26.040]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched
[07:26.040 --> 07:31.680]  out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young
[07:31.680 --> 07:36.720]  Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've got

[08:03.920 --> 08:15.360]  the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Ladies and gentlemen,
[08:15.360 --> 08:21.640]  there are a lot of questions swirling around the tragic Boston bombings of eight, nine
[08:21.640 --> 08:26.480]  days ago last Monday.
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.200]  Monday before this Monday. But what we know undoubtedly is that the power structure and
[08:32.200 --> 08:40.000]  the propaganda media is seizing on this, basically foaming at the mouth, saying you've got to
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.160]  give up all your rights, the entire bill of rights. No first amendment, no second, no
[08:45.160 --> 08:51.300]  fourth, no fifth, no tenth cameras, microphones, streetlights, listening to you and watching
[08:51.300 --> 08:56.040]  you checkpoints everywhere.
[08:56.040 --> 09:02.560]  Entire cities must be ordered to be on lockdown anytime there's a gunman anywhere. Every city
[09:02.560 --> 09:09.720]  needs tens of millions of dollars worth of bomb detecting and destroying robots, warrantless
[09:09.720 --> 09:18.360]  searches. Just tens of billions to be spent on more high tech cameras on and on Bloomberg
[09:18.360 --> 09:27.600]  and King and McCain are all in the news saying we have got to basically abolish the Bill
[09:27.600 --> 09:30.200]  of Rights and the Constitution.
[09:30.200 --> 09:38.360]  Meanwhile, 520 plus people were shot and killed, many of them innocents by gang bangers in
[09:38.360 --> 09:46.420]  Chicago. In Chicago, just in 2012 and they're set to break that number this year in a city
[09:46.420 --> 09:53.120]  where they've taken all of the citizens' guns. A great old American city of Chicago, we're
[09:53.120 --> 09:59.440]  on the radio on 1530 AM. And you look at everywhere else with crime off the chart, it's where
[09:59.440 --> 10:02.460]  guns are highly restricted.
[10:02.460 --> 10:11.000]  Like Boston, like New York, like Detroit, like Los Angeles. Look at cities in Connecticut
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.320]  where they have very strong gun control laws. And you look at areas with almost no gun control,
[10:16.320 --> 10:22.240]  lower crime rates. And I know we've talked about this at nauseum, but the system is engaged
[10:22.240 --> 10:24.440]  in a cold blooded power trip.
[10:24.440 --> 10:32.040]  A cold blooded power grab because they get hundreds of billions of dollars a year. In
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.440]  fact, guys, pull up the 2012 budget for Homeland Security. If memory serves, one part of it
[10:37.440 --> 10:43.120]  was 84 billion and then it was supplemental of another 60 billion and then other funding.
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.520]  Most of the anti-terrorism part, mind you, not the other agencies, there's 37 agencies
[10:47.520 --> 10:48.520]  under it.
[10:48.520 --> 10:55.760]  But the last number I saw was over $200 billion a year. And a few months ago, and Erin Dykes
[10:55.760 --> 11:01.240]  wrote about this. Big Sis came out and she said in the press conference, she said, you
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.500]  will not cut our funding, and it was a cut in the growth of it, of more than 10% a year.
[11:06.500 --> 11:12.140]  Or there will be more terror attacks. Now let me ask you, is there a motive to let terrorism
[11:12.140 --> 11:23.520]  happen or provocateur terrorism or stage terrorism to get $200 billion a year domestically?
[11:23.520 --> 11:27.680]  And that's what this is. You go to college now, it's all about scholarships and Homeland
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.160]  Security, data mining, how to spy, how to profile. Hey, how about we profile the out
[11:33.160 --> 11:37.960]  of control kleptocratic government?
[11:37.960 --> 11:50.320]  How about we look at those groups? The budget request was 57 billion, and they got 47.4.
[11:50.320 --> 11:56.200]  But that's just for the overall office of DHS, not for the 37 agencies. If you count
[11:56.200 --> 12:02.600]  all the money, quote, law enforcement agencies, or quasi law enforcement, Homeland Security
[12:02.600 --> 12:10.200]  agencies, I think it's about 10 of the 30 plus agencies, it's over $200 billion.
[12:10.200 --> 12:16.200]  And now under cybersecurity, they're talking about a budget for cybersecurity over $50
[12:16.200 --> 12:22.640]  billion a year. And they're talking about every four years when they get budgetary oversight
[12:22.640 --> 12:28.280]  and then refund it, kind of like the FAA is funded in four year spurts. They're talking
[12:28.280 --> 12:34.720]  about over, again, $200 billion.
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.480]  So we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. It's like the Pentagon budget
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.880]  is 1.1 trillion a year. Guys, check that, pull up Pentagon budget. But then they have
[12:43.880 --> 12:50.320]  supplemental that's over 800 billion a year, and that's not even counting black funding,
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.860]  secret funding, which is estimated to be 50 to 100 billion.
[12:55.860 --> 12:59.340]  And no one really knows, they use narcotics traffic, you name it. Global narcotics traffic
[12:59.340 --> 13:07.880]  into the US is 500 billion. Total global narcotics profits are estimated to be well over a trillion
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.560]  dollars. And you heard it right, the United States is almost half the world market in
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.560]  illegal drugs.
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.760]  And I tell you, the government had a great strategy to make drugs illegal, hype them
[13:20.760 --> 13:26.000]  up as cool with Hollywood, put a lot of money into it. So it's seen as avant garde and nouveau
[13:26.000 --> 13:37.360]  riche and a get rich quick scheme. Yeah, look at that article from the Center for Strategic
[13:37.360 --> 13:40.080]  Budgetary Assessments.
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.920]  It says the DOD includes a $553 billion in discretionary funding, $5 billion in mandatory
[13:45.920 --> 13:52.480]  funding, an additional $118 billion in requested wars in Afghanistan. By the way, again, these
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.940]  are whitewashed numbers. If you pull up the numbers, it's almost 2 trillion some years.
[13:57.940 --> 14:01.960]  And I tell you, these numbers we're getting from government sites are absolute crud. Because
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.520]  I mean, I've seen them break down the numbers in Congress when we talk about the real cost
[14:06.520 --> 14:07.520]  of the entire thing.
[14:07.520 --> 14:20.000]  Like watch this, Pentagon budget over 1 trillion, watch this. Pentagon budget over 1 trillion,
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.400]  and then you learn it's actually over that. 1 trillion Pentagon budget cut is possible
[14:28.400 --> 14:38.840]  but not wise. Now that's a decade long cut. Defense, 2 trillion divides Obama and Romney.
[14:38.840 --> 14:45.560]  Defense spending despite 2.1 trillion under Romney. 1.2 trillion for national security,
[14:45.560 --> 14:56.000]  there it is. Unbelievable, the point is that they reported on 2 trillion missing two days
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.360]  before 9-11. Watch this, 2 trillion missing Pentagon.
[15:02.360 --> 15:12.720]  Look at this, go ahead and punch this up for me, guys. CBS News, 2.3 trillion missing from
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.080]  Pentagon. So I'm sorry, it's 2.3 trillion. That's the type of stuff that we're talking
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.840]  about here. And that's why they want this takeover. Now, let me just stop here and reset
[15:23.840 --> 15:30.720]  on air so I can calmly attempt to go over all of this today.
[15:30.720 --> 15:36.220]  Let me tell you some of the news that I'm gonna be breaking down here. Number one, they
[15:36.220 --> 15:46.440]  are using the events of 9-11 to radically re-engineer the society. And despite all the
[15:46.440 --> 15:54.040]  basic liberties and freedoms that have been overrun, butchered, attacked, dismantled,
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.360]  decimated, firebombed by the criminals that have invaded the country who wanna be above
[15:58.360 --> 16:04.680]  the law under globalism and wanna tie us down with bureaucratic tyranny.
[16:04.680 --> 16:11.680]  Classical tyranny in our face. It did not keep us safe. You notice that we're in debt,
[16:11.680 --> 16:16.640]  the country's going bankrupt, we're hated worldwide, over a million Iraqis are dead.
[16:16.640 --> 16:24.040]  6,000, 7,000 US troops just from combat injuries, that's a conservative number. Tens of thousands
[16:24.040 --> 16:31.840]  more committed suicide. All of this going on in this psychopathic globalist push for
[16:31.840 --> 16:33.620]  world domination.
[16:33.620 --> 16:40.320]  And now you have 400 troops, 2,000 police down there at the Boston Marathon searching
[16:40.320 --> 16:45.460]  people's bags, you name it, a drill going on right where the bomb happens. And it did
[16:45.460 --> 16:51.880]  not stop the terrorist attack that killed three people and injured 100. That you would
[16:51.880 --> 16:58.000]  think was the end of the world. I mean, they're having bomb scares in hundreds of cities and
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.720]  towns, total panic.
[16:59.720 --> 17:05.040]  If a box blows out of the back of a truck, in Phoenix, they've got bomb squads for hours
[17:05.040 --> 17:11.520]  shutting everything down and ordering everyone to evacuate. And if you don't evacuate, they
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.000]  come to your house and drag you out by your hair and point guns at you. And I saw on CNN
[17:16.000 --> 17:26.680]  a woman who lived by a park in Boston, in the suburb of what, Watertown.
[17:26.680 --> 17:33.360]  And she's out there with her kids, and a helicopter flies over and says, get in your house. And
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.640]  the police drive by in hundreds of photos and videos and point guns at people. And I
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.200]  mean, it can be a 10-year-old blond haired kid, clearly not the suspect. Or it could
[17:43.200 --> 17:48.000]  be a 14-year-old black woman, black girl, black child.
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.080]  I've seen the video and they point guns at her. Yeah, you must be the suspect. Yeah,
[17:53.080 --> 18:00.640]  we're looking for a 19-year-old Caucasian, literally the definition of a Caucasian from
[18:00.640 --> 18:08.120]  the caucuses. You're looking for a white guy. And here, let's have a blonde woman walk out
[18:08.120 --> 18:11.880]  with her family and then she lowers her hands for a minute.
[18:11.880 --> 18:19.080]  Let's poke her and slap at her and tell her, get your hands up, you piece of trash. And
[18:19.080 --> 18:25.060]  the videos and the photos from our listeners pouring in, they'll get up in their window
[18:25.060 --> 18:30.500]  and start taking photos of the cops and the cops aim a gun right at them. It's all about
[18:30.500 --> 18:32.080]  them putting your hands on you.
[18:32.080 --> 18:35.920]  Take the Texas State Police, and guys, cue this video for the next segment for TV viewers.
[18:35.920 --> 18:47.120]  For radio listeners, just type in Two Girls, One Glove, Infowars.com. And they pull the
[18:47.120 --> 18:53.020]  women over, no due process, no nothing. They claim that they thought they might be speeding.
[18:53.020 --> 18:58.400]  And they sit there with the same glove and go in both sisters' orifices. I mean, a total
[18:58.400 --> 19:03.200]  assault, ladies and gentlemen. You could get, who knows, hepatitis, anything, you don't
[19:03.200 --> 19:04.200]  know.
[19:04.200 --> 19:10.360]  E. coli, who knows? And the trooper forces her hand in. I mean, you can see it into their
[19:10.360 --> 19:15.100]  body and the state police came out and said, yeah, we're gonna do this to everybody. We
[19:15.100 --> 19:19.800]  defend that, that's a good idea. We're gonna pull you over, including your children. We're
[19:19.800 --> 19:21.480]  gonna ram our hands into your body.
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.760]  In fact, they had a big pull out just again last week. We did one a few months ago, but
[19:26.760 --> 19:33.920]  then Americans said, no, we want proctology exams. See, government wants to put its hands
[19:33.920 --> 19:41.320]  in you. This is rape. Now, no one bought it, the grand jury, and died of the state police,
[19:41.320 --> 19:46.060]  they'll get off. But the state police in Texas, at least the people running it, want to pull
[19:46.060 --> 19:50.880]  your wife over, aim guns at you, all right, get her up against the car, and go into your
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.060]  body looking for drugs that the government publicly ships in.
[19:55.060 --> 20:00.740]  This is martial law. We're gonna break it all down straight ahead.

[24:00.520 --> 24:13.820]  By the way, at the bottom of the second hour coming up I am going to try to do a basic
[24:13.820 --> 24:25.120]  review just off some notes I wrote last night of the new Tom Cruise film Oblivion. And I'm
[24:25.120 --> 24:29.280]  just going to say this now, I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan. I like some of his earlier
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.560]  work. I happen to know a lot of behind the scenes stuff about Tom Cruise because he lived
[24:33.560 --> 24:37.800]  with the Sheen family when he was first making it big for about a year.
[24:37.800 --> 24:41.440]  He was best friends with Emilio Estevez. So I don't particularly think he's a very
[24:41.440 --> 24:51.360]  nice person. But separating Tom Cruise, and by the way, this is one of his best roles.
[24:51.360 --> 25:00.440]  This movie is an anti-Illuminati tour de force. In fact, this is better than 2001 Space Odyssey.
[25:00.440 --> 25:05.960]  I mean, they've got some action scenes that are pretty good for the general dumbed down
[25:05.960 --> 25:16.200]  public. But I literally, my dad said, yeah, I went with my dad last night. And he said,
[25:16.200 --> 25:19.960]  he said, yeah, I don't usually listen to reviews, but I almost didn't want to go see it until
[25:19.960 --> 25:20.960]  you asked me.
[25:20.960 --> 25:27.400]  Because all the reviews said that no one could understand it and the plot didn't make sense.
[25:27.400 --> 25:33.080]  And it basically got bad reviews. And I went and saw the movie and no wonder it got bad
[25:33.080 --> 25:42.360]  reviews. My mouth was hanging open, hanging open. Because let me tell you something, the
[25:42.360 --> 25:48.920]  director and his co-writer, Joseph Kosinski and Arvid Nelson, I want to get these guys
[25:48.920 --> 25:50.140]  on the show.
[25:50.140 --> 25:56.520]  No wonder they came from nowhere and wrote this and got this movie made. Because this
[25:56.520 --> 26:05.440]  film is a Rosetta Stone of what the Illuminati is actually planning. My mouth was, here are
[26:05.440 --> 26:12.000]  the words, hanging open during this. Because this is actually what Ray Kurzweil and all
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.240]  of them think they're going to do, from their own writings.
[26:16.240 --> 26:24.380]  And listen, this is not a pro-Illuminati revelation of the method, externalization of the hierarchy.
[26:24.380 --> 26:37.040]  This is a anti-Illuminati, anti-death cult, anti-technocracy, anti-transhumanist film.
[26:37.040 --> 26:44.760]  Anti-technocratic, it's more of the vein of perhaps the transhumanist from a genetic perspective,
[26:44.760 --> 26:55.240]  but a spiritual genetics, dealing with things like ancestral memories, things like that.
[26:55.240 --> 26:59.760]  And again, I don't think of myself as that smart. See, I'm already doing the review right
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.560]  now. I don't think of myself as that smart. And then I just don't get why other people
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.760]  don't get basic stuff.
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.560]  It's like, one time I sent a tweet out of the sun and the clouds and I said, who said
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.720]  the stars only come out at night? And all these people commented on it. And no one got
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.880]  what I was saying, like what is this? I mean, there's the sun, it's a star. Who says the
[27:17.880 --> 27:21.160]  stars only come out at night?
[27:21.160 --> 27:26.900]  The darker it gets, the more you can see the stars. I just don't understand how no one
[27:26.900 --> 27:33.680]  understands what this movie is talking about. Every 10 seconds, it's got archetypal messages
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.360]  and all of them are positive. Now, who knows if we've really got a soul, but if we do have
[27:40.360 --> 27:43.800]  souls, it's when we love each other, that's what makes our souls.
[27:43.800 --> 27:52.600]  And then it's the opposite with the, it is really an amazing film. And if you separate
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.940]  out the ending of the movie and replace it with the Illuminati, who are not really illuminating,
[27:57.940 --> 28:03.840]  they're bringing total death, then you've got basically their program and their plan.
[28:03.840 --> 28:09.320]  And these guys are definitely listeners. I would bet money, but beyond that, because
[28:09.320 --> 28:15.320]  I haven't even really broken all of this down. I mean, you see oblivion and it's the choice.
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.920]  Do you want the oblivion of the cold blooded psychopath or do you want love?
[28:20.920 --> 28:28.480]  I mean, that's basically what it gets into. And obviously, the film's already been spoiled
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.000]  for people. I don't think it spoils it, talk about it. But at the bottom of the next hour,
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.820]  I'll try to just go over the basics. Actually, after the movie recorded some comments I've
[28:35.820 --> 28:42.200]  got to write down so that I go over all the points. But I got home about 1030 last night,
[28:42.200 --> 28:48.120]  got in bed about 11, sat there with my iPad for about an hour reading reviews and couldn't
[28:48.120 --> 28:50.480]  find one positive review.
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.600]  Basically, even the positive ones were tongue in cheek and like, yeah, it's got great visuals
[28:56.600 --> 29:02.560]  when I'm sick of Tom Cruise and I don't quite understand it. And it just goes on and on
[29:02.560 --> 29:10.920]  and on and on. And I think Tom Cruise did a great job of the film. People say they have
[29:10.920 --> 29:16.480]  such a flat affect in it. Well, yeah, of course they have a flat affect. And the movie is
[29:16.480 --> 29:20.560]  all about compartmentalization and how it's a prison.
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.840]  I mean, I'm telling you, see, the reason I've got to spoil the whole film is because people
[29:24.840 --> 29:30.800]  aren't getting it. So I'm going to do the film a favor today or tomorrow. I'm going
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.420]  to shoot a breakdown and then show all of what I'm talking about. I may have to go back
[29:35.420 --> 29:38.800]  and see the movie tonight and sneak a bunch of still shots in it to be able to really
[29:38.800 --> 29:41.640]  show that a lot of the film's not even out there.
[29:41.640 --> 29:47.080]  But I want to do the film a favor. And I was all my listeners go see Oblivion. I'll decode
[29:47.080 --> 29:51.040]  it for you at the bottom of the next hour. Martial law coming up. We're on the march.

[33:40.520 --> 33:44.440]  time callers. We do a few times a week to hear what you have to say about what's happening in
[33:44.440 --> 33:52.600]  the world, how they're trying to pass open borders, anti gun legislation. In fact, guys,
[33:52.600 --> 33:57.960]  will you pull me the stack from Sunday? I never even got to it or just type in
[33:57.960 --> 34:05.160]  California passes gun law budgets 24 million for gun confiscation or just or just reprint that.
[34:05.160 --> 34:10.440]  I've got to get to that. They are moving on all fronts. Internet taxation, sales tax taxation
[34:10.440 --> 34:20.680]  online. The whole agenda is barreling forward. While the state police across the country take
[34:20.680 --> 34:28.120]  blood without warrants and now put their hands inside of our bodies as the TSA did to Miss USA.
[34:29.080 --> 34:32.840]  And if you're a TV viewer, we're showing footage of the state police searching two sisters.
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.080]  And we haven't even got to the part where it looks like the cops trying to force her hand
[34:37.080 --> 34:42.200]  into the body. And again, the state police defended all of that. So that's what I was
[34:42.200 --> 34:48.280]  mentioning earlier about how the government wants in your person they want in your body.
[34:48.280 --> 34:53.000]  They want to force you to take vaccines. They want to force you to have abortions.
[34:53.000 --> 35:00.680]  That is the globalist policy worldwide. They want to control your life. They see you as a biological
[35:00.680 --> 35:07.000]  Android. They see you as obsolete machines. They don't need you anymore. They have robotics.
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.760]  This is the age of the drone, the age of the robot, the age of the autonomous
[35:12.760 --> 35:18.840]  sentient being that the globalist believe they're going to merge with.
[35:18.840 --> 35:25.880]  Merging into the all seeing eye that burns red. By the way, you know what's incredible?
[35:27.800 --> 35:31.720]  This is why oblivion hit me so hard last night. Guys, will you pull up the
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.800]  Rise of the Machines, End of Humanity, October issue
[35:37.800 --> 35:43.320]  of Infowars magazine, or go to Weldon, get me a copy right now, please. Back in the warehouse,
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.320]  they kept some back as collector's items. Bring me the second issue, please.
[35:51.560 --> 35:58.280]  Because nowhere, I looked this up last night, nowhere, nowhere online, I don't know how they've
[35:58.280 --> 36:03.160]  done it. And I was joking when I said I'd go and take photos to show you. I can just tell you,
[36:03.160 --> 36:11.160]  I can just tell you. Nowhere online do they show you the villain, the bad guy, in oblivion.
[36:11.720 --> 36:16.600]  They say they've kept this movie secret like nothing else. And that they're obsessed with
[36:16.600 --> 36:21.560]  that, obviously. Now it's out, so it's not a secret. The bad guy from the movie is on the
[36:21.560 --> 36:32.600]  cover of my magazine from October of last year, out of my mind. That's why this movie freaked
[36:32.600 --> 36:40.840]  me out so bad. Because again, it's an archetype. And these archetypes are things that we already
[36:40.840 --> 36:48.040]  inherently know to be true. Very, very bizarre, but as I said, I'm gonna do that at the bottom
[36:48.040 --> 36:56.680]  of the hour. Or I can just go to Google and show you Rise of the Machines, Rise of, you got it?
[36:56.680 --> 37:02.840]  There you go. A black pyramid with a large glowing red eye,
[37:03.560 --> 37:09.640]  sitting on top a pile of skulls. Ladies and gentlemen, oblivion.
[37:14.360 --> 37:21.560]  The end of humanity, Rise of the Robots, DARPA the real Skynet, October surprise.
[37:21.560 --> 37:31.880]  There it is. That was a composite done by the art crew with my design.
[37:35.080 --> 37:37.960]  You see, this show is a warning, ladies and gentlemen. The Illuminati,
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.080]  this is what they're planning. This is what they say they're going to do.
[37:41.080 --> 37:49.640]  You understand that? This is an emergency transmission.
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.920]  But let me actually show you the exact bad guy from the movie. Please, this.
[38:02.360 --> 38:03.880]  That right there if you're watching on TV.
[38:03.880 --> 38:11.720]  All right, that's enough. Man, it's like a brain boost or something seeing that movie.
[38:11.720 --> 38:14.760]  And you know I don't just come up here and rave about movies. I think they're pretty much all
[38:14.760 --> 38:19.000]  cheesy, even though they're well done. I watch Stanley Kubrick films now and see all the subtleties
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.400]  and the messages. But still, it's not as powerful as they were when I was younger.
[38:24.200 --> 38:29.960]  I don't wanna say I'm cynical, I just am well researched and can see multi layers into things,
[38:29.960 --> 38:36.200]  as any of you can if you simply open your mind up to the universe and become truly illuminated.
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.400]  You see, the Illuminati is a counterfeit of what the God of the universe will actually give you.
[38:42.440 --> 38:47.560]  And it's a pale counterfeit. A shadow of a shadow of a counterfeit.
[38:49.160 --> 38:57.640]  I'm gonna give the number out right now. It's 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231.
[38:57.640 --> 39:07.080]  800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[39:13.720 --> 39:17.160]  You're never gonna see a representation of the devil more accurate than what's
[39:17.160 --> 39:23.800]  on your screen right now. That's the devil right there.
[39:23.800 --> 39:31.720]  And what's it doing? It's jacking your humanity and destroying it.
[39:35.720 --> 39:40.600]  And it uses the best of us against us via compartmentalization.
[39:42.920 --> 39:44.920]  All right, let me get into the news here.
[39:44.920 --> 39:54.200]  I have an article here where the federal government is looking at forced psychological testing
[39:57.400 --> 40:03.640]  for all Americans. The New Freedom Initiative 2.0.
[40:06.600 --> 40:11.560]  Meanwhile, America is number one in fear, stress, anger, divorce, obesity, antidepressants, etc.
[40:11.560 --> 40:17.080]  A Las Vegas hospital accused of dumping psychiatric patients in California,
[40:17.080 --> 40:20.920]  accused of it? They're doing it all over the country. Bed bugs invade hospitals.
[40:20.920 --> 40:23.880]  Why more patients share rooms with blood-sucking pests?
[40:23.880 --> 40:25.880]  Why are hospitals the most dangerous place to go?
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.680]  Because it's where the government is in control. It's where Rockefeller medicine is in control.
[40:34.120 --> 40:36.840]  If I've got a gunshot wound or a compound fracture
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.080]  or a finger cut off, I'll take the risk to go to the hospital.
[40:43.240 --> 40:48.200]  But if I need something else, I'll go to a little local clean new clinic.
[40:50.280 --> 40:52.040]  And they're trying to federalize those right now.
[40:54.680 --> 40:59.640]  And why do I mention that? It's because they're gonna force more people on drugs,
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.240]  then you're gonna have more mass shootings, and the answer will be more psychologists,
[41:03.240 --> 41:12.360]  more psychologists as the Priest Guild to go around and drug America out so bad that we fall.
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.360]  Because the world is gonna get so horrible, you're going to want drugs to get you out of it.
[41:19.160 --> 41:26.440]  The GMO, the fluoride, the chemicals in the water. When all you really need is to go out and play
[41:26.440 --> 41:32.280]  sports with your friends, climb a hill, go for a swim, and yeah, go get drunk if you want to.
[41:32.280 --> 41:35.880]  I'm not even saying that's the best thing out there, but it's a lot better than Prozac type
[41:35.880 --> 41:41.560]  drugs. They show in major studies, there's several of them, the University of Texas and others.
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.440]  They've got a German study, a Russian study, drinking is associated with higher IQs.
[41:46.440 --> 41:52.040]  Why is that? Because people that have higher IQs cannot handle it. You can't handle the truth.
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.640]  You can't handle the perception. You can't handle how hardcore reality is. Let me tell you,
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.120]  not being on caffeine, not drinking at night is like being on a drug. Because the world is so
[42:04.120 --> 42:11.160]  real and so vivid and so incredible that you wanna go drink a bottle of red wine,
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.000]  eat a big steak, and lay back and watch a football game because reality is hammer blows.
[42:20.280 --> 42:23.480]  Yeah, there it is, psychology today, why intelligent people drink more alcohol.
[42:23.480 --> 42:27.480]  They've got a University of Texas study too on higher IQs, living longer.
[42:27.480 --> 42:29.000]  The problem is there's the abuse of it.
[42:32.280 --> 42:36.680]  I mean, sometimes I need to turn my brain off. I know drinking makes me overweight and stuff.
[42:36.680 --> 42:53.480]  I don't drink that much. I had a couple drinks with my dad last night at the movie.
[42:53.480 --> 42:59.480]  What do you do? What do you do knowing all this? That's what I think every day,
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.920]  almost feel ashamed. I don't almost feel ashamed, I am ashamed.
[43:02.920 --> 43:07.000]  I am ashamed that I dropped the ball because I need to do a better job for myself and you and
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.680]  my family, everybody else, and so do you. How I got caught up trying to convince people it staged,
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.240]  how I got caught up in all the minutia when the big story is martial law in Boston
[43:17.800 --> 43:23.160]  and citizens being treated like slaves. And then debating, would the government
[43:23.160 --> 43:26.040]  provocateur something? They've been caught over and over again.
[43:26.040 --> 43:29.720]  I should just focus on the thousands of declassified programs,
[43:29.720 --> 43:36.040]  some of which had thousands of dead apiece, where they nerve gassed and bioweapon our own trips,
[43:36.040 --> 43:42.840]  foster kids, force sterilized people, radiate foster kids, all declassified.
[43:42.840 --> 43:49.320]  Our government, since the 30s, has been running eugenics covert operations,
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.480]  thousands of which have been declassified. The last ones declassified are from the 90s,
[43:53.480 --> 44:01.160]  where they kill people. But if they take a foster child in New York in 2004,
[44:01.160 --> 44:06.120]  the social workers finally spoke out and deliver little black kids mainly, eight-year-olds.
[44:06.120 --> 44:10.040]  They tell them others, they always profile. Okay, you got a two-year-old, we're gonna take a two-year-old
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.120]  unless you sign this waiver, we're gonna take your eight-year-old, healthy by the way.
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.520]  And they took him to a big pharma facility, this was in the New York news only once or twice,
[44:18.520 --> 44:23.480]  because whistleblowers went public. The media had the courage to cover it, then it got shoveled on
[44:23.480 --> 44:28.120]  the rug. You heard about kids being given deadly AIDS drugs who didn't even have HIV,
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.720]  because they needed, quote, healthy subjects like a rat.
[44:31.720 --> 44:38.680]  You know, this shampoo is animal testing free, it's like, good, good. What about human testing
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.720]  free? Well, they just take your economy away and then make you have to go to pay the rent
[44:43.720 --> 44:50.760]  and have medical experiments. Well, not just testing deadly chemotherapy drugs on kids,
[44:50.760 --> 44:57.960]  they took black kids. Cuz blacks have been the test group all along, who've been allowed to be
[44:57.960 --> 45:02.280]  tested on, you let the hookers operate there, let the drugs operate there. What do they say
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.760]  in The Godfather? They're animals anyways, let them lose their souls. Well, the globalists see
[45:06.760 --> 45:11.480]  everybody as animals, except them, when in truth, they're beyond the animals.
[45:11.480 --> 45:15.960]  They have lost their humanity, they're psychopathic, they're cold blooded, they're a joke,
[45:15.960 --> 45:22.280]  and they've got a bunch of nobodies working for them on power trips. Who want to be warriors,
[45:22.280 --> 45:27.080]  but really are just bullies, because they're scared to death of real war.
[45:28.120 --> 45:32.200]  They're too weak minded to face what's happening. And I remember reading, I think it was in New
[45:32.200 --> 45:35.800]  York Daily News, you name it, about one family where they told the mother, we'll take your
[45:35.800 --> 45:39.720]  two year old if you don't do this. And they took the child, and then they tested pesticides,
[45:39.720 --> 45:43.400]  on him for a month, until he tried to get away, so they chained him down.
[45:43.400 --> 45:48.760]  And then they administered the pesticides in higher and higher dosages, till he died,
[45:49.720 --> 45:57.000]  in a pesticide study. And finally, the CPS went, these kids are dying.
[45:59.240 --> 46:04.440]  This isn't saw, this isn't hostile, where you go and think it's cool to watch women tortured,
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.800]  and live through that, and kind of, ooh, that makes me feel powerful,
[46:07.800 --> 46:12.360]  so you're scared deep down, you're so powerless, that you get off vicariously,
[46:12.360 --> 46:16.920]  seeing simulated torture. Don't worry, there are real little kids being tortured right now.
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.520]  There's medical experiments in China with little kids, don't worry, don't worry,
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.760]  and it's gonna happen to you. You're being experimented on by the vaccines in the water
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.560]  of the food. You think you're gonna go watch this in a movie at your little low level,
[46:29.560 --> 46:33.960]  and then it's not gonna be done to you? Don't worry, you're gonna die horribly painful
[46:33.960 --> 46:40.040]  tortured deaths. Don't worry, you love hurting innocents, God is gonna smash you into a thousand
[46:40.040 --> 46:45.640]  pieces, but very slowly, by letting the system do it to you. Yeah, there's a headline,
[46:46.440 --> 46:51.880]  Organic Consumers EPA to Allow Pesticide Testing on Orphans and Mentally Handicapped Children.
[46:52.440 --> 46:59.000]  That was an article, I think, months before it came out. And I remember the article described
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.600]  the little black boy. He stopped struggling, they administered the final dosages, and he died.
[47:06.600 --> 47:12.600]  Oh, it's so liberal, like the baby swimming in the toilet. And people on my YouTube made jokes
[47:12.600 --> 47:17.080]  on Infowars, going, there are too many people, Jones, don't tell them what to do.
[47:17.080 --> 47:23.560]  The baby's getting exercise. I'll get you and your little dog too.
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.440]  Oh, yeah, you're real powerful, all you evil people. I bet you'd be real tough in the ring
[47:28.440 --> 47:33.800]  with somebody with a battle ax. Here, here's your battle ax. Here's a good guy up against
[47:33.800 --> 47:38.440]  any day, he'll smash your guts into the ground. But only because we know we're dealing with some
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.320]  scum that's gotta be put down. We don't enjoy it. We'll crush you for the innocents,
[47:43.320 --> 47:48.440]  not because we enjoy it. You're cowards, you're cowards. And the only sick satisfaction I've
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.640]  got, and I repent for it, is knowing this evil system you're bringing in is gonna tear your guts
[47:53.640 --> 48:00.040]  out slow. And you're damned to hell after that. Make sure you know that.
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.680]  Do not stare too long into the abyss unless you become the abyss.
[48:10.680 --> 48:19.080]  God, I watched the police in those videos in Boston, stomping around,
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.960]  bugging their eyes out with crazy looks on their faces. And just saying, open your door
[48:23.960 --> 48:27.400]  and coming in and pointing guns at family, people in their own houses shooting video of it.
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.280]  And the cops, and the compliant media showing shots like a guy running with his daughter and
[48:32.280 --> 48:38.040]  the cop helping him only show that image. Instead, the real images of just driving by,
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.560]  just like I saw at the G20 when Rob Dew was there. On the news, they would say,
[48:43.560 --> 48:47.080]  no one's allowed out during the day, period. They would drive around in residential areas
[48:47.080 --> 48:50.760]  and they would see 12-year-old kids playing football in their front yard.
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.040]  And they'd aim sound cannons at them. Just this lust to pull your wife over and ram their hand
[48:56.040 --> 49:01.720]  up her, and then take her sister and ram their hand up her. And just the need to, okay, there's
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.480]  some people that, kids thinking this is America, you can be out in your front yard. Let's hit them
[49:05.480 --> 49:12.760]  with sound cannons, boom. And watch those slaves run, watch those taxpayers run, drive them into
[49:12.760 --> 49:23.560]  submission now. Show no mercy, do what must be done. And the Wall Street Journal comes out and
[49:23.560 --> 49:27.720]  says America is now a battleground. We're gonna have checkpoints and troops. It's gonna be so
[49:27.720 --> 49:34.280]  sexy and billion dollar and $10 billion contracts to congressman's wives.
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.120]  And we're gonna spy on you. And we're the new elites with red carpets and jet copters. And I
[49:40.120 --> 49:45.960]  mean, it's just a bunch of guys. I mean, look at Hagel, bunch of info.wars.com. Look at Hagel,
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.840]  you know, wearing his turtleneck and his black sunglasses cuz he was involved in black ops.
[49:53.560 --> 49:58.600]  They all think he's cool. He's sexy. Yeah, he's been involved in really dark stuff. It's really
[49:58.600 --> 50:05.000]  cool. It's really cool. Yeah, and it's really cool to do all this. When I come back,
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.320]  I'm gonna cover the martial law news and then go to your phone calls. But look at it right here.
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.520]  Drugs report has it linked. Boston wrong. Residents ordered out of homes at gunpoint
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.120]  by SWAT teams. So now the president said if there's one gunman on the loose,
[50:18.120 --> 50:21.480]  whether it's true or not, all of you are suspects, all of you are criminals.
[50:21.480 --> 50:25.800]  And we're coming in your house just like Katrina. And next it's coming in your house to take your
[50:25.800 --> 50:31.320]  guns. And it's all about planting the flag, setting the precedent, showing you and showing
[50:31.320 --> 50:37.960]  police nationwide, this is what we do. And the police have ceremony after ceremony on TV where
[50:37.960 --> 50:46.440]  they're heroes and just grandstanding up there, absolute mental illness. Absolute mass mental
[50:46.440 --> 50:51.880]  illness. What are they getting us ready for? Bloomberg says, we've gotta stop our interpretation
[50:51.880 --> 50:56.040]  of the Constitution. We have to change it. We have to get rid of it because the criminals need
[50:56.040 --> 50:59.640]  to be protected in government. They're getting ready to fully take over. They want to put their
[50:59.640 --> 51:03.880]  hands on your body. Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step

[54:03.640 --> 54:09.400]  Don't worry. This show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:16.200 --> 54:19.800]  Yeah, you know, Rush is coming to Austin tonight. I think some of the crew's going to see it. I'm
[54:19.800 --> 54:24.600]  not going to go. I'm going to go hang out with my family, but yeah, they're anti-New World Order.
[54:24.600 --> 54:27.480]  They've been anti-New World Order for a long time, but now a lot of their new music is just
[54:28.040 --> 54:32.920]  total anti-New World Order. And the good news is more and more good people are realizing what's
[54:32.920 --> 54:38.920]  happening out there. The film Cloud Atlas was anti-New World Order. I mean, there are a lot
[54:38.920 --> 54:44.120]  of people really starting to get the dehumanization that's taking place and realizing that there's no
[54:44.120 --> 54:48.520]  future if we don't turn things around. The reason I brought that up is Jon Baum was pointing that
[54:48.520 --> 54:52.120]  out to me. And yes, you're right, Jon. You're right. I agree with you. Look, we're going to
[54:52.120 --> 54:56.920]  come back and take your calls. Anthony, Jon, Shelley, Daniel, Jacob, and others. It's open
[54:56.920 --> 55:03.560]  phones today. No guest. I need to get to listening to my message that I left myself or my voice memos
[55:04.680 --> 55:10.520]  so that I can write down all the notes I've got on my oblivion review.
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.920]  I want to do at the bottom of the next hour. Who knows? I may do it at the start of the
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.000]  next hour, but then I'll never get to it if I don't get to it soon. So I've got that.
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.800]  And you've just got all this incredible stuff happening. All the evidence, this was scripted.
[55:21.800 --> 55:29.160]  And then you get things like this in the Huffington Post. California gun confiscation bill
[55:29.160 --> 55:36.200]  passes, approves 24 million to expedite illegal gun seizure. And it says it makes your semi-auto
[55:36.200 --> 55:43.160]  is basically illegal. And will begin the door-to-door confiscation of 40,000 handguns
[55:43.160 --> 55:48.520]  and assault weapons illegally owned by Californians. SB140.
[55:53.480 --> 56:02.120]  Oh, man. There you go. But there's no gun confiscation coming. And again, it's not only
[56:02.120 --> 56:06.520]  that they did this martial law drill, they're saying this shows this is the new America,
[56:06.520 --> 56:11.400]  the Wall Street Journal says. This is how you're going to live for your safety.
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.280]  For three dead people in an event that's got fingerprints of the globalist all over it.
[56:16.280 --> 56:19.640]  And then you've got the hyping and they're saying there will be more bombings.
[56:20.840 --> 56:24.760]  The good news is they were going to go with the Tea Party. That was clear. We derailed them.
[56:24.760 --> 56:29.000]  So they went with their fallback patsies, who the FBI knew and watched for years and knew
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.760]  where they lived. And they were at their houses and at their dorms like nothing had happened
[56:33.400 --> 56:37.560]  until they got the word, the mother says. And then something scared them so they fled.
[56:37.560 --> 56:41.720]  And then you've got what a couple of witnesses, the witnesses are saying conflicting things too.
[56:43.400 --> 56:48.920]  But we have the unprecedented and now Kurt Nemo has added images to the Watson article
[56:49.640 --> 56:58.680]  that Drudge linked to. You go to DrudgeReport.com in the middle column, it says Boston residents
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.240]  ordered out of homes. And then you notice the Daily Mail's under it and they added more video.
[57:05.240 --> 57:08.520]  And then you notice the Daily Mail's under it and they added more videos. That's our article
[57:08.520 --> 57:12.200]  is the original. They wrote off our article and give us credit in the Daily Mail. But that's what
[57:12.200 --> 57:15.880]  I told Nemo this morning is just to add more videos and photos because we've literally got
[57:15.880 --> 57:19.480]  hundreds of photos and dozens of videos. I'm trying to dig up the one I know we were
[57:19.480 --> 57:25.560]  taping when it happened. When CNN showed the woman at her house that's right by a park with
[57:25.560 --> 57:30.440]  her kids and they fly over in the day and go, get in your house. I mean, I'm sorry, man. I'm
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.720]  not getting in my house. I've had enough of you. The borders are wide open. Illegal aliens are
[57:35.720 --> 57:40.520]  above the law. Nothing even against them. The point is that this is all about training
[57:40.520 --> 57:45.000]  the American citizens that were like milk cows or something. And I'm not your slave and I'm sick of
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.200]  it. They use security as the new slavery. We're gonna enslave you to keep you safe. No, thanks.
[57:50.200 --> 57:55.000]  I'll take my Bill of Rights and Constitution. Everything that's happening is 180 degrees,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.560]  the opposite of the Bill of Rights and Constitution. Let me point this out to you.
[57:57.560 --> 58:05.400]  I told you for 17, almost 18 years this was coming. Now, I was on here about two years
[58:05.400 --> 58:10.360]  as a mainline libertarian before I really woke up. So for 15, 16 years, I've told you this.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.880]  And I went to Urban Warfare drills and watched Marines training to take you out of your house
[58:15.880 --> 58:21.160]  and shoot you in the back of the head. And take your guns and put you in a FEMA camp in America.
[58:22.600 --> 58:26.600]  And I put that in my film Police Day 2000. And I interviewed police chiefs and others
[58:26.600 --> 58:31.480]  who were all vets who said this is a martial law conditioning drill. Chief Ali Philippus,
[58:31.480 --> 58:35.800]  Thomas Sanchez, you name it. These are police chiefs and people I'm listing here who I have
[58:35.800 --> 58:44.440]  on video. I've been warning you. I told you this was coming. This is GCN,
[58:44.440 --> 58:54.040]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network. You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[58:54.040 --> 58:58.680]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal
[58:58.680 --> 59:03.480]  for home protection. When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.360]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:21.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.440]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls. Then we'll get into the raft of anti-American
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.600]  insider crony capitalist mafia consolidation that's going on from internet sales taxes that
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.120]  Obama's ramming through right now to just everything that's happening. Martial law in
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.640]  Boston, linked up on the Drudge Report. And we've got photos of them aiming guns at men,
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.600]  women, and children for no reason. Shoving women around. Get out of your house,
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.920]  lady. You look nothing like any suspect. We're just gonna do this. This was done all over the
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.000]  place in a giant act of just planting the flag on the good old slaves. And commenters are in
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.920]  here going, try that south of the Mason-Dixon line, boy. Like Katrina? Let me tell you,
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:11.240]  they'll always give you an excuse and a reason, a shy-op.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.840]  And I'm telling you, man, the police and military are just spoiling for a war with the American
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:20.120]  people. Just spoiling, just spoiling. I saw a G20 where they would just run up to,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.360]  nobody was resisting them. Nobody was coming out. So the G20 was over that night. Rob
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:30.120]  Du got arrested. He won a lawsuit over it. And word comes, they're gonna not let university
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.360]  students be out at the park at night. So they're out there like they always are.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.920]  It's like eight at night. And they block the road so nobody can even get back in their dorms.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.360]  And then women are on bicycles and cops knock them off and then just start splitting their heads.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.880]  Cuz that's like a fringe benefit to get to beat a woman with a
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.800]  billy club if you're a sadomasochist or I guess a masochist. Who are the ones that like to beat
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.680]  people? I guess they're the sadist. Yeah, they're the sadist. And it's like, well,
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.400]  that's pro law enforcement. And now the state police in Texas say they will proctology you.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:05.080]  Now it's okay they say that proctology, you just gotta put a different glove on, you see.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.120]  So that's just some of what's coming up today. And I support the police. I think it's good.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.520]  I think the police should have executed everyone in Boston just to make sure the police are safe.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.920]  Cuz when cops shoot somebody who's NSA, it's not even in the news,
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:26.120]  hardly. But this whole event, nowhere in the world would they lock down most of a major city
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.680]  and kick everybody out of their houses. I mean, for 1,000 combatants, you wouldn't do that.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.240]  I mean, this is beyond martial law. It's just, see what they can get away with.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.280]  Can TSA take your five-year-old to a private room where some pot-bellied guy with a creepy mustache
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.400]  grabs him? Absolutely. And you're a terrorist if you don't like it.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:50.440]  If it's a defrocked priest or a Sunday school teacher that caught molesting people,
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.000]  put them in the habit, make them the head of the TSA in that airport.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.560]  Why not? It's over the top. Teach the slaves to submit properly.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.800]  Anthony on the Boston bombing, go ahead.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.200]  Hi, Alex. First time caller. Thanks for taking it.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.120]  You know, I think for a call screening, you may need a proctology exam to be on my show.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.040]  How do we know there's not a bomb up your patoot?
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.840]  Now, I think that it's unbelievable how, you know, once again, this police commissioner,
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:24.680]  this clown, he comes out, slips up again. Very obvious that he's under the order of someone else.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.640]  Oh, yeah. That police chief looks like he is a total creep. And he looks like he's
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.840]  totally hiding stuff. Oh, gee, you think a major police chief's hiding stuff?
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.320]  Oh, yeah. And I definitely wanted to shout out to Dan Badade for shaking his boots up.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:45.320]  Did you see those people when he was in that press conference? If we had a Dan Badade
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.200]  everywhere that something like this happens, we would be winning, even though we're already
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.920]  winning. Am I right? You know, he's got a nickname around here, and it's the Titan
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.840]  or the Kraken. The Kraken is a Titan. We say release the Kraken
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:04.760]  because every time you send him to something, that's what happens. Dan Badade, it's not even
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.960]  courage. He knows they're bad guys. He has an instinct to fight evil. And he also freaks people
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:16.280]  out because he, in person, he looks like an overgrown Dr. Evil in a good way. He's like
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:23.080]  the good Dr. Evil. But absolutely. Anything else in the Dan Badade worship session here?
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.880]  No, that's it. Thanks for taking my call. All right. God bless you, man. Yeah, I know
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:34.040]  we need people that are, I'm not bragging. I pioneered in modern times in the last 18 years,
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.160]  going out and confronting people at press conferences because nobody would ever ask
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.800]  real questions. Every time I asked Bush a question or Janet Reno a question or,
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.640]  you know, Al Gore a question, it would end up being National News. And that's what We Are
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:50.920]  Change does. And you should all do it and just go and ask real questions. And everybody else
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.120]  are paid operatives and, you know, selling their family out. It's all I can say to the
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.800]  reporters is give your kids more shots. You can bury them a lot quicker because, you know,
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:03.880]  the government loves you. In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:10.120]  supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:15.560]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.600]  out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.320]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:30.600]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.240]  with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it. With nutrient dense food you can store for

[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:07.400]  amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.200]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.960]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:23.320]  satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team.com, but I want to point out the

[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:42.840]  to you by the New World Order and the Ministry of Truth. The truth is, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:50.840]  we are innocent until proven guilty. And what you saw happen in Boston on Friday,
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.440]  and they've even continued it with all sorts of checkpoints and weirdness after,
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.920]  is a precedent-setting case of over-the-top martial law.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.560]  Even when Baghdad was under martial law when it was taken over by the West,
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:12.040]  they didn't say don't leave your houses, period. No one has ever done things like this.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:18.200]  In Ceausescu's Romania, they said don't be outside after dark unless you have a special
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:25.960]  government pass. And basically, then it's just an excuse to catch your underage daughters out
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.320]  after curfew and rape them. I mean, that's what's done in these authoritarian societies.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.120]  That's what they then mimic in things like V for Vendetta when they catch Evie out after dark.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.200]  And she's like, I'm sorry, I was just trying to get home, I was late. They're like, come here,
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:49.640]  little missy pie. That's what bondage is, and this is standard, souped-up, hardcore, over-the-top
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:57.320]  tyranny. All of Boston, almost the entire city, all of Watertown, hundreds of thousands of people,
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.160]  you will stay in your house. You will not leave, and we're gonna come in your house
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.240]  and point guns at you and your family and bug our eyes out at you.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.120]  I mean, this is the threat, this is the danger, this is what the founders warned us about.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.720]  For TV viewers watching on prisonblinded.tv or we're still sending out free video feeds right now
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.160]  at infowars.com forward slash listen as the free audio streams and video streams. Let's roll
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.080]  some of those video packages Darren McBrain put together of photos and videos.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.000]  You can also see them up at drudgereport.com in the middle column. Shocking footage Americans
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:39.320]  ordered out of homes at gunpoint by SWAT teams. This is what martial law looks like.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.000]  And it shows people in their cars, in their houses, you name it, with men driving around
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.680]  in armored vehicles pointing M-16s at you. And then telling families, get out of your house.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:56.760]  Families don't even resemble the supposed suspects. Blonde-haired women, black women,
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.240]  put your hands up. Then the woman lowers her hands after and the cops run up and shove her. Get your
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:09.160]  hands up, scum. I'm your God. In Texas, we put our hands inside you. You want me to rape you?
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.840]  I'm your government. I'm your God and we're gonna make vaccines mandatory.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.040]  This is our country, Homeland Security.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.200]  In every third world country, they get conquered by their military.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.080]  For the first 200 years of Rome and its golden age, you could not bring troops
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.360]  past the Rubicon River in northern Italy. Troops were not allowed in Italy, period,
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.880]  unless the Senate officially voted if Rome itself was being invaded.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:51.320]  Or if Italy itself was being invaded. Now, why couldn't you bring troops into Rome?
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:57.080]  Why does Posse Comitatus, 1878, and before that, the Bill of Rights Constitution say no troops
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.920]  quartered? Why? Because they lived under it and they were historians who spoke on average
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.480]  five languages. Cuz back then being a rock star was that you invented things.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:11.400]  You could speak four or five languages. If somebody smarted off to you, you'd say,
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.880]  all right, get your sword, we're going outside. That's what women liked back then. That's what
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.960]  the newspapers wrote about. So we had a flowering where being smart was cool.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.560]  It was called the Renaissance. It was called the Enlightenment.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.640]  It was not land of the cowards, home of the slaves. It was land of you tread on me, buddy.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.600]  I don't know how this is gonna end, but you're gonna get one hell of a fight.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:42.440]  And now we're the opposite. The heroes, the heroes. It would have been heroes. Okay,
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.040]  let's say these patsies really were shooting back and there's some evidence they may have been
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.880]  probably set up double agents now coming out. Yeah, the cops have pulled SUVs up if it's true
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.640]  and got out and had a firefight with these guys.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.440]  You're doing your job, but you're a man. You're not a coward. You'd call yourself a hero.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.480]  Going around, I mean, I've seen this before just national security events.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.840]  The cops will march over, arrogant, get in your face cuz they've been told to be arrogant,
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.960]  and scream at you and bug their eyes out. And it's pathetic. I mean, it's embarrassing.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.960]  But it's so full of you better respect me, who I am. I'm Superman.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.880]  And you're the opposite of America. And folks, if you're not angry looking at these photos and
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:29.480]  videos of what they did to people, I'm gonna have Kurt add even more. Guys,
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.360]  cuz the Daily Mail sources us, which is good, and Drudge has this up, but they have more of
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.160]  the videos. Ask Kurt to go to the Daily Mail linked under our link on drudgereport.com
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.760]  and just add it all because it's our article that's super viral and everybody to see this.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.600]  Cuz we have, I mean, McBrain this morning goes, what do you want added? We got hundreds of these.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:54.200]  Well, just add it all. Cuz people are already going, this is only a few cases out of examples.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.480]  It's not all of them, this is happening. Ladies and gentlemen, you're all suspects. You're all
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.440]  bad. You're all treated like terrorists. There's no warrants. How did they suspend
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.680]  going everybody's houses without warrants? How'd they do that in Katrina? All the guns will be
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.360]  taken, no one will be allowed to be armed. They are beta testing this, and they're saying
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.920]  in the Wall Street Journal, well, let's have the whole country like this for our safety.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:25.000]  For our safety? Especially martial law in Chicago, does that keep you safe?
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.200]  Decriminalizing the drugs the government ships in will cut the crime. Legalizing guns everywhere
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.680]  will cut the crime. Not having men in black uniforms everywhere saying papers, please.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.520]  In fact, punch this back up, guys. We have a link up at the top of our info wars.com
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.520]  article that says papers, please. And it shows 1938 Germany, two young soldiers looking at
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:51.880]  people's papers, and then Boston. And you look at the satisfied look, you look at the satisfied look
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.520]  on these military guys faces, and they just get off on it.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:06.680]  It's the exercise of raw power that is just so pathetic. Of course, it never happened down there
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:13.080]  on the border doing that. It's just all a fraud. And see, the noose is getting tighter and tighter
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.400]  around our neck. Well, now I can't go to a kite festival without Army wanting to search me in
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.120]  Austin. If I go downtown now, the TSA is expanding out in random checkpoints where they come up with
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.080]  cops and shove you up against the wall and go, we're getting in your bags, we don't care what
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:31.640]  you say. We're meant to bring that up to the police chief. And you're all destroying your
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.120]  future. You're all playing along like you're part of it. This is scientifically controlled,
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:43.320]  orchestrated, transhumanist, eugenics, tyrannical takeover where we're all under attack. And you
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.840]  know what? You're not gonna be able to count on the police and military to help us. Some of them
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.160]  are doing the right thing. We need to reach out to them. But it's us, the citizens, the drones,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.960]  that have to stop saying yes to all this and bending over because you invite this.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.040]  They're already announcing they're taking the government pension funds. They're gonna take the
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.000]  private pension funds. They're gonna take all the money out of your bank account. They're gonna take
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.960]  everything you got if you bend over. If you give in, if you lick the boots, this is the plan.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.520]  And by increment, they're teaching you how to lick boots. They're teaching you that
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.040]  that's what America's about. USA, USA. Yes, sir, point the gun at me, come in my house,
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.640]  shove my wife up against the wall. Thank you, officer, USA, USA. I can't have a gun myself here
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:30.520]  in Boston, but thank you for having a gun and coming in and shoving my wife up against the wall.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:36.200]  Thank you, officer. And the news is every Bostonian loved being under martial law,
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.880]  civil emergency. No, they didn't. There are a lot of Bostonians that didn't.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:44.600]  They called into the show. By the way, I'm not making fun of a Boston accent. I love it.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  In fact, I think I'm gonna start talking like that. But the point is, is that I just like to
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.360]  do accents. Perhaps I should speak like this. Here in England, we don't have any firearms unless
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.840]  you're wealthy. Then you have armed guards like the red coat telling us turn our guns in. Hello,
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.360]  Americans, I work for the New World Order. Turn your firearms in. I am Piers Morgan.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:11.000]  I'm running from indictment in England. I have armed guards myself. But you should turn your
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.080]  firearms in immediately. I'd like to dress up in a uniform myself and kill Alex Jones.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Missouri. Thanks for holding her on the air, sir.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:25.160]  Hello. Hello, my friend. Hello, Alex.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:31.880]  Hello. Good to hear from you. Good to actually talk to you. I want to start off by saying that-
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.640]  Wait a minute. If we screen your call, how do I know, because you're guilty until proven innocent,
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.920]  that you don't have 14 dead kids in your basement and that you don't have five hand
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.600]  grenades up your hind end and the TSA doesn't need to come in your house right now and do
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:47.880]  a proctology exam. Look, pal, I've been beta tested over here in the ghetto for the last
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.360]  seven years of my life, okay? I don't believe it. I think you may be al-Qaeda.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.520]  I only trust the black uniform government. I only trust the government. I love them.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.440]  I love them. I love them. It's totally normal. We need proctology exams on the side of the
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.680]  highways they're now doing. Go ahead, I'm sorry. Citizenship doesn't give you immunity
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.920]  from the law of war. If you take up arms or hostile acts against the nation-
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.240]  Oh, like Vernon Del Waco? You'll be killed or captured. That's the law.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:22.360]  I've been- Look at that. I'm sorry, we had to have a Ms. Lindsey Graham on. I'm sorry,
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.080]  go ahead. Twinkle Toes is done. What was your next point? I'm sorry.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:31.640]  No, you're okay. I want to say something about Boston. Like I said, I'm a black man. I've been
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.800]  in the ghetto. Well, I'm out of the ghetto now, thank God. But I've been a part of the beta test.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.360]  I've seen it from the ground. I've seen it. I've been a part where if they start resisting,
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.600]  you start resisting. You're not even resisting, you're still getting beat. So I understand that.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.480]  And to see what happened in Boston, America, you guys need to wake up.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.800]  I don't think it's enough. I think if they just say resist, they should gun you and your whole
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.360]  family down. And if you got a baby, take it out of a stroller and just smash its brains out and
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:06.680]  use it as a face cream for the police if it's sunny outside as a sunscreen. I think to respect
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.480]  police like they did in the Aztec Kingdom and the Druid Kingdom, we should sacrifice our children
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:17.080]  to them. They should pass a national law to sacrifice our children to the government at
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:22.680]  the Washington Monument. It'll be like Logan's run, you'll beg them. Because if they said it
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:28.280]  was like you'll be a TV star and it's really cool, like American Idol, if you get to say,
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.080]  beat your child to death with a ball peen hammer on the steps of the Capitol,
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.680]  then it would be good. I mean, don't you think that's a good idea for America, sir?
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.000]  That's what they're trying to give their impression to the people that-
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.080]  Sir, what's wrong with being pulled over and having police put on gloves and put them inside
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:49.640]  two women's bodies, four orifices? I mean, that'll be the American flag. The American flag ought to
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.440]  be a person in a uniform with a gun to your head ramming their arm up you, okay? I mean, I just,
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.720]  I don't appreciate you extremists. We're going to come back and talk to this terrorist,
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.000]  guilty until proven slave. Hail the new world order. Hail, hail, hail.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.160]  The coming financial collapse is real. The subsequent social unrest will happen.

[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.280]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.440]  counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.680]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.280]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.600]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:57.640]  for your copy. 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:04.280]  800-686-2237. In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:10.920]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:15.320]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:20.280]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.080]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.280]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.920]  with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient dense food you can store for up

[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.240]  Independence, they laid their bodies down in a bloody war.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:34.280]  On a bloody war. For liberty. For their descendants. And I owe a blood debt to my ancestors
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.960]  for being tough as nails and founding this country and founding Texas and most of you have ancestors
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.160]  that were involved in founding this great republic. Thank God for the renegades.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:51.880]  And I'm not going to let them down. We have to recognize the evil. What's coming next if citywide
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.160]  they come to your house, point guns at you, and come in your house without warrants looking for
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:01.240]  one guy, knowing they were testing a media shy op? The average cop didn't even know that.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.480]  And obviously some of the cops didn't act like total jerks, but they were still carrying out
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:12.120]  unlawful orders and their whole search of the city didn't find the guy. The lockdown kept people from
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:18.760]  finding him in the back of the boat. That later came out. I'm gonna go back to your calls. I'm
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:25.000]  gonna do the oblivion thing next hour. I promise I will. My review of that, the anti-eliminati
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.080]  tour de force, I'll just leave it at that. But they are now, the state police of Texas now
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:35.880]  will pull you over, not even for speeding, and tell you to bend over the car and they will ram
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.440]  their hand into your body. And the state police head said, that is normal, we authorize that.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.920]  And they are now in court defending against the indictment of the state police saying,
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:49.000]  no, this is normal. They were in the news saying it's normal. So when I say, hey,
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.440]  you know, we don't know if John in Missouri, we don't know if he has bombs in him.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:02.520]  Guilty under proven innocent. Government always does this. That's why it's against the law.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.120]  That's why it's stated in the Constitution Bill of Rights that the government can't do this.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:13.720]  That the government can't do this. And that's why Bloomberg says get rid of it,
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.400]  because they're a bunch of crooks that have stolen this country. I'll call Bloomberg a crook,
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.480]  trying to take our rights, trying to rule our life, trying to shut down gun manufacturers
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.640]  around the country with racketeering type activities. They're a bunch of crooks,
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.480]  a bunch of dirty crooks, the Fast and Furious crowd, all of them.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:35.640]  They're a mafia that wants you disarmed so they can treat you how they want and be above the law.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:40.600]  That's what the New World Order is. And I talk about, you know, sarcastically,
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.200]  I shouldn't even joke. People think, it's for the government and kill their kids.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.520]  If we have a government worshiper listening, the status, they might actually say that's a good
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:58.120]  idea. In every culture, every culture in known anthropology and archaeology, every culture gets
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.680]  a civilization, then becomes decadent, centralized, and the leaders demand human sacrifice of babies
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:10.040]  and children and women. First, it's bring me the best food and bring me your virgins
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.280]  to the temple, cuz I'm the high priest and I wanna do things to them.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.320]  Then it's, you know what, I wanna kill kids, bring me your kids, and people do it. And then
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.120]  they finally say, this is usually when the priest group gets overthrown for a while,
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:31.160]  they go, I want the king's firstborn. And the king gets mad and doesn't do it. In fact,
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.560]  you can study in a bunch of different cultures, they start demanding the king be sacrificed.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:43.320]  The bureaucrats, if the bureaucrats had their way, they would start demanding whoever the titular
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.720]  head was be sacrificed. That's pretty much what the Kennedy assassination was. This is all
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.600]  Illuminati stuff, folks. I don't believe in it, they do. People say, this is wild stuff,
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.360]  it's history. I dare you to show me a culture where they didn't engage in human sacrifice.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.360]  The Greeks did it, the Romans did it, the Babylonians did it, the Japanese did it.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.360]  What do you think war is, sending our sons off?
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.880]  All right, I'm ranting. John, finish up your points. I'm gonna come back in a long
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.080]  segment, get to Jacob, Lucy, Shelley, Paul, and others. Go ahead and finish your point, sir.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:25.880]  Just real briefly, I was able to manage and watch how they operate. I mean, they operate, not all of
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:32.360]  them was bad. I'm not saying the whole police was bad, but just when you're watching every day,
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.760]  another dog getting kicked in, you see how they operate.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.920]  You see when you're getting followed into your house, they know who you are,
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:46.600]  when they know where the drug's at, and they're not harassing those people, then it's very obvious
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:51.640]  that it's something wrong. But when you see it on a mass scale, like something like Boston,
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:57.560]  and I turn to MSNBC, I've seen the pictures on your site. And when you see that, I mean,
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:03.480]  I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but that's obvious that they're just letting you know,
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.920]  it's it, it's time, game's over, this is what you're gonna go through.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.760]  And I'm telling you, when you go through that every day, because I've been through that every
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:17.560]  day, guns out, point at you. When they pull up to your car, they act like you are the criminal,
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.760]  when they got the drugs. I mean, you've watched them take drugs from people and just not arrest
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.800]  them. I mean-
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:29.400]  Well, I know, listen, they took down China by making drugs illegal, and so they could
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.720]  corrupt the police, and that's how the West took them over, the Opium Wars. Look it up, folks,
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:39.160]  this is an exact plan they're following. And it's not our opinion, either the police,
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:44.040]  the military, the media decides to join the people, or they give into this total takeover.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.200]  But don't think you're part of the winning team, folks, you're under attack as well in this
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:56.440]  oblivion. We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:06.760]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law

[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:10.200]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear. For Christ's sake, Ben,
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.960]  don't you understand? Americans love television. They wean their kids on it.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:21.000]  Listen, they love game shows. They love wrestling. They love sports and violence.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:25.800]  So what do we do? We give them what they want.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:32.040]  We're number one, Ben. That's all that counts. Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:37.080]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian. But I'm a quick learner,
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.320]  so I'm going to give the audience what I think they want. We now take you live
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:47.800]  to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:55.400]  The running man came out in the mid 1980s and more and more our country looks like that.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:59.560]  That's what we saw in Boston was the running man. Who knows if they were real?
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:04.840]  Who knows that they're like Whitman, Price and a Dodd. Their debt to society paid in full,
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:12.840]  basking in the Maui sun. Last season's winners, no last season's losers.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:18.680]  And all the people that think they're winning in this system, you're the losers. Attaching USA,
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:26.840]  USA to having your rights overrun. I mean, it's bizarre, man. I get around cops and they like
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.600]  bug their eyes out and act like all on power trips. And then you see other cops are just
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:35.000]  acting normal and friendly and nice. And you get to know these people. They're always the normal,
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.080]  successful, decent people who are actually more manly than they are.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.760]  They're always the normal, successful, decent people who are actually more manly than the
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:52.200]  weirdo police they're looking for now. And I obsess on police because in any police state,
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.480]  you better know what you're dealing with. You better know what you're up against.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.920]  You better understand it. And listen, we've got a criminal government run by foreign banks.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:05.240]  We are occupied. They're trying to mop up what's left of the media. They're trying to take over
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.560]  the web. They're trying to track everything with Internet sales taxes. I've read the bill,
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:14.920]  it is so draconian, makes your head spin. And here's the good news. People are finally
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:19.560]  freaking out. I'm monitored at home in the morning and driving into work in the morning
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.640]  and driving around doing errands and things at night, talk radio, national and local.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.880]  Everybody's freaking out, like 90% of the callers about it all. People are really getting it.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.680]  But you don't just need to get it, you need to say no. You need to not comply with stuff that's
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:45.080]  unconstitutional. And you need to work like the dickens to do everything you can to warn people
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.080]  ahead of this. Because it's not enough to buy guns and just wait in your cabin and say first
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:54.040]  person comes around here is deader than a hammer. You need to spend that energy in the information
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:36:01.320]  war, hammer down, screaming bloody murder. Because, ladies and gentlemen, they're getting
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.720]  away with everything right now. And again, you're like, why would they declare martial law in a
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.480]  whole city, call it a civil emergency? I've always told you they'll call it a civil emergency,
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:15.640]  public safety. And you notice it's never gonna be called martial law.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.080]  It was called a civil emergency public safety when they looted the first houses they went to
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:25.240]  were in the high and dry area in Louisiana, some of them $15 million historic homes.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:30.680]  I happened to have been given a coffee table book about a year before that happened. Cuz
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.920]  my wife had lived in New Orleans for a few years. One of her family gave her a coffee table book
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.880]  with New Orleans. So I was reading about the architecture, knew the houses that I was then
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:49.400]  seeing on television when they were going in there taking their guns.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:55.080]  And then I get the army manuals. Guys, punch up Rob Do that I'm going to your calls. Rob Do's
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.800]  report that's got two and a half million views titled Military Trains to Shoot Americans That
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:04.200]  Don't Turn in Guns. And then it shows the army manual, how they process our social security
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:09.080]  numbers, how they put us in the labor camp, how they kill the people that don't turn the guns in.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:16.600]  And it's got the army manual number that's at army.mil. I mean, that's red alert, over the top,
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:33.400]  out of control. Watch this, Army Trains to Shoot Americans That Don't Turn in Guns.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:39.000]  And this is still not working, it's still not typing.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.680]  I'm gonna probably get a new computer or get it worked on.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.760]  What I normally do is, what I normally do is break a computer. That's the only way I get a
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.600]  new computer. I just break it, quietly take it, smash it, put it in the trash, I've actually done
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:56.440]  that. And then that's how I get a new computer. Cuz I've been going on for about a week, is it
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.120]  time for this computer to die? I mean, I know it's all the crap they make with the poor Chinese
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.600]  slaves anyways. The point is that article's everywhere, go ask Rob Do to bring it up to us.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:09.720]  The video's got two and a half million views on YouTube. US military trains to shoot and kill
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:15.400]  Americans that don't turn their guns in, boom. And it's got all the manuals, it's got it all.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:21.160]  People say, don't scare me with this information. I'm not trying to scare you,
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.680]  I'm trying to get you to do something.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.400]  I'll call Rob Do. Let's go ahead and there it is, troops ordered to kill all Americans who
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.160]  do not turn in their guns, 2,376,000. Now, ladies and gentlemen, that needs to have 50
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:45.320]  million views, okay? That needs to have, thank you, sir. They keep fixing and it keeps not working.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.800]  Anyways, I'm just sick of it. I'm tired of trying to convince people we've been taken over by
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.960]  crooks. Congress is having hearings about taking anything they want out of your bank account,
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:58.920]  no judge, no jury, and taking all your pensions. They will do it, they're hardcore criminals.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:06.040]  The wives of congressmen in some cases get $10 billion contracts to spy on you. They're a pack
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.680]  of larcenous scum. And all you idiots that work for the system, they will take everything you've
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:16.920]  got as well, you morons. You're not part of the winning team. You're under New World Order
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.360]  control. You're being poisoned through the food and water and vaccines already.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.920]  And a lot of you won't listen. But when your wife dies young, or your kids start dying,
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.360]  or your neighbors start dying like they already are, and you look at the numbers,
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.480]  you're gonna learn they're killing you and your family. That doesn't matter.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.080]  Put on a black uniform and act tough in front of everybody for your egomania.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:41.240]  Or be a bureaucrat spying on people, or working a corporation doing all this because they're
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.400]  shutting the corporations down that aren't globalist right now. I'm sorry, I said I'd
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.360]  take calls. I'm just so angry right now. I shouldn't even probably be on air. I'm so
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.360]  sick of it. I'm so tired of it. What does it take to get people out of their coma?
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:58.440]  This is an enemy foreign banking force planning its flag on us for martial law training and
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.480]  bragging in the Wall Street Journal that this is the new America battlefield. Shut up checkpoints,
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:13.240]  arrest, take the guns, rob everything. Don't you get it? In Mexico, in places in Africa,
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.200]  most of the countries, it's just the military runs everything.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.960]  And there's no production. Cuz no one even try to build anything or make anything in Africa or
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:26.520]  Latin America. Cuz the military will get jealous of that and come and rob it. And just so you don't
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.840]  try to get it back, they'll kill you. All over, almost every African country,
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.720]  if you try to build or make anything, the military or police come by, steal it,
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.800]  and then kill you so that you don't ever come back on them. And so there's nothing.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:44.200]  The whole society falls down until there's one president in a rotting compound with weapons
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:53.080]  everywhere with crazed look on his eyes and giant uniforms with salad all over it,
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.360]  all little ribbons and symbols. And now you look at our police and military,
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:02.280]  they're all in third world dictator clown outfits, stumbling around urinating all over us politically.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.680]  I mean, where's the spirit of 1776? Where is America? Well, I'll tell you,
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.960]  they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us. Get ready for that, and they're gonna start
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:18.440]  their fight. They're gonna conscript your kids into national service. Your kids are gonna come
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.760]  home, it's already happening, and boss you around about the environment, and boss you around about
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:27.160]  your guns, and then report you. And then they'll be on the news saluting as you're taken away to
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:34.760]  a forced labor camp. Think I'm joking? Guys type in Army manual reeducation camp.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.520]  They even use the term reeducation camp. You're like, why? Why use the Soviet term?
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:43.480]  Why use the Alexander-Shelton-Eason term? Why not? Go all the way. Yeah, Man Cal,
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.920]  Man Cal even I was able to talk to these military people. He saw a whole bunch of trucks
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.560]  with mannequins stuffed with dirt that the military had been shooting up of men, women,
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.880]  and children. You're like, that couldn't be true. Really, they confirmed the targets of
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:05.720]  five-year-old children and pregnant women to shoot. Internment resettlement operations,
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:11.720]  FM 3-39.40. The government, look, when they blow stuff, they're not just gonna come get your guns.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.200]  They're gonna put out a cover story. They're gonna make it look like there's a reason they've
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.720]  got to do this to set the precedent as a shy op to get you to stand down. The truth is I talked to
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.800]  a lot of Bostonians who didn't buy into what happened. Okay, let's go to your calls. Jacob
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:31.400]  in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air. Hello, Alex. Man, you've got me so worked up
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:35.960]  right now. You are firing on all cylinders today. I'm loving the show. I can't thank you
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.760]  enough for what you do. Please don't thank me, brother. Well, I'm calling because I wanted to
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.080]  validate you a little bit because you talk about how people can be so dumbed down.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:51.800]  I shared your videos, the YouTube videos, where the Boston police are going door to door and
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.360]  taking people out of their homes. And people comment on the video saying, well, there's so
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:00.600]  many people in the house. Look at them coming out. They must have been doing something wrong.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:06.040]  I'm telling you, people are just completely oblivious to what is happening. It just blows
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.960]  my mind. That's because they have been scientifically programmed incrementally
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:16.120]  on record. And when they were arresting us and even putting us in labor camps,
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:20.200]  because we got to pay our way, they will cheer that on as well.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.800]  Because they're so cowardly, they will accept anything. See, once you buy into evil,
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.040]  you've got to keep saying yes to it because you never want to admit you're wrong. You understand?
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.640]  These people, the New World Order looks at these chumps you're talking about
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:39.560]  and absolutely sees a dinner. It's like a wolf seeing a bloodied sheep, what happens?
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:46.040]  And they think, they know it's evil. They think if they grovel to it, it's going to be okay.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.760]  And that's the spirit. That's why it's happening.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:55.000]  Well, I just want to thank you for what you're doing. I go month to month on Prison Planet to
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.160]  support you a little bit more. I want to encourage current Prison Planet members to do that. And for
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.960]  those of you that are listening, because you're getting so much traffic right now,
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.120]  you got to take a look at what Alex Jones has done over the past 15 years.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:11.640]  This is the information that he throws out there. I mean, it's because of your information, Alex,
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:18.440]  that I no longer just hear the news. I create a web of information in my mind and it is so
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.080]  liberating. I can't tell you how liberating it is to be able to discern from the news,
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.320]  not just hear the news. And so I can't thank you enough for helping me do that.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:33.320]  Well, by the way, brother, what that is, is you haven't really brain boosted. You're just awake
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:39.640]  now. And people are asleep. Their brain waves are lower. They're in a near sleep state. They watch
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:44.040]  TV all day. They shuffle around. They act like they're working. Big studies are out that about
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:48.920]  half the workday is spent checking email and frittering. And so they're just these lazy,
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:54.280]  shuffling, dead people. The New World Order lives. We sleep. And Christ says it's time for
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:45:01.880]  the sleeper to awaken. And it's time for people to awaken. And then when you know history and you
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.200]  see what's happening and you know how cold blooded they are and how much money they're stealing,
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:11.400]  you go, my God, crooks took over everything. And they've hired a bunch of subservient weirdos
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.080]  that love the exercise of power. You know, there are people that like to,
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:22.360]  you know, have power who will sit there and, you know, enjoy abusing farm animals all day.
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:27.800]  I mean, it's basically the same mindset of pressing on the nerve of power hollow,
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:32.840]  mindless, just incredibly bizarre. They're getting rid of any due process in Canada right now
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.600]  to secretly arrest and disappear people with their fake al-Qaeda deal. Again, the Western governments
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:43.080]  run al-Qaeda. Why are we having to give our rights up because of al-Qaeda? They run. Again,
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:47.480]  it's all two plus two equals four. It's all incredible common sense stuff.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:53.320]  And that's why I get so angry. That's why I get so mad is that I know about the declassified
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.280]  declassified medical testing on little kids still going on where they kill little kids.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.200]  The government orders it. They're murderers and they kill kids over here and don't get in trouble
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.120]  exercising their power and then go, oh, look at this eight year old boy.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.720]  Give your rights up to us and use our own emotion, use our goodness against us.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.800]  Get our best men to go serve them and do horrible things because they believe they're really
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:25.320]  battling the threat of Islam when it's all a clash of civilizations, PNAC plan to build up
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:30.200]  the radical Muslims, have us have a war with each other that they really used to double back and
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:36.440]  attack patriots with, which they're now doing. And I warned you, how did I warn you? The PNAC
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.720]  document stated the plan like we're idiots. And then they said, we'll use race specific weapons
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:47.880]  to kill most of the people after we've had this clash. The clash is to put the electronic spy
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:54.920]  drone kill grid in. Once Skynet, and that's their Pentagon word, that's not from the Terminator
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:47:01.080]  series, they used a Pentagon term. Once from 1977, once Skynet is in place, once the digital
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.520]  skin is in place, they're putting the proper drugs in the water to control us.
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:07.880]  They're actually wearing battle planning. This is all public, they write books about it.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.440]  Listen, they're basically like an off world group of aliens, but they're humans.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:18.600]  They might as well be oblivion. They might as well be the Black Pyramid. They might as well
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.560]  be the red eye of Sauron. They believe that's what they're going to become. And you can say,
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.720]  well, they're channeling Satan that is an off world entity. That's pretty much what it is.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:32.360]  I've analyzed this so long, I'll just tell you. Satan's real, folks. It's a black freaking
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:38.120]  pyramid. That's what I envision in my mind is Satan six, eight months ago. And that's what
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:43.320]  other people envision as the pure evil, the dehumanizing, technocratic, complete takeover,
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.120]  and the end of humanity as we know it, taking its time to grow the artificial skin,
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.520]  compartmentalizing everybody. And again, whether you believe in God, the devil, whatever,
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.080]  humans are manifesting. The technocrats believe that they're gonna dumb us down,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:02.200]  create the world government, orderly exterminate us, while always saying it's terrorists or other
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.120]  groups that did it. I mean, do you see what I'm saying, sir? It's a battle gridded,
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:13.080]  war gamed, giant program, all sliced and dialed and prepared. And notice it's all rolling out,
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.000]  just as I said it would. Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:20.600]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. And once again, I have to validate that because if a new listener is
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.520]  listening to you talk about these things, and they can seem so shocking. But I'm telling you,
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:30.120]  once you start to wake up to the paradigm that we are all in, like in our minds and our perception,
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:33.640]  you're gonna start to make connections. And you're gonna start to understand
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.640]  how some of these things come about. I mean, you've done such an awesome job of showing people
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:42.920]  how false like terrorists happen throughout history, and how central banks have done so much
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:49.000]  to enslave humanity. And folks, until you can't just hear what Alex Jones has to say,
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  you've gotta do your own research. You've gotta start making connections in your own
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.520]  mind so that when you hear things, others then from Alex Jones, you're gonna start making those
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.520]  connections and things are gonna validate themselves.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:06.600]  Well, listen, I hope listeners are listening to me. The government since the 20s and 30s
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:13.320]  has done declassified medical experiments where if a girl made a B plus on a paper below B plus,
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.560]  they would sterilize them. And they would do medical experiments on them while they did it,
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:22.120]  sometimes just kill them. Listen, I appreciate your call. The globalists see themselves as
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.760]  technocrats. They say that themselves. I've been saying that for 15 years since I really
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:31.480]  discovered all this at a deeper level. And now you notice the EU calls themselves technocrats
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.400]  because they're books, they call themselves this. And they believe they're scientific and
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.960]  cold blooded. We're dumb animals. We deserve to die. They're really just people on
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.680]  crazy narcissistic power trips. They do have high IQs, but they don't have empathy.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:50.280]  They're soulless. The only soul they've got is wanting to hurt beauty.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:58.920]  They have a dark soul, a twisted soul, a stinking soul. The Bible says the demons stink. I mean,
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.960]  these people, they stink. You can call it whatever you want, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  You can call it whatever you want, but the end game is the same. And they think you're
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.920]  dumb animals. They think you can't admit what's happening. They brag about it.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:19.720]  And they're growing a digital electronic prison skin into everything. All the new appliances,
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:25.400]  everything with them listening to you. The CIA brags about it. Just a hardcore vicious takeover.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.880]  They're poisoning you and your family. They're poisoning me. Everyone's ill all over the place.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.880]  They're reporting that a 30-year-old is the equivalent of a 50-year-old now.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.840]  They're murdering us. And it's just gonna get worse and worse and crazier and more suicides
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:47.080]  and more attacks. You just gotta pray to God, the God of the universe, the God of the Bible.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.520]  And I'm telling you, that's the only thing that's gonna open your mind and soul to defeat this.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.280]  We gotta just hit our knees and say, Creator, we know there's a dark force.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:59.400]  Help us. We wanna be good. Make me a vessel against this. And then it will all open up.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:08.840]  In the US, one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:16.600]  Burglars call it smash and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We

[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:19.000]  Look, everybody who's given a secondary education is taught there's too many people. Humans are ugly
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.960]  and bad, but only those that love the state are good and virtuous. That's taught standard
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:28.760]  everywhere worldwide in the last 100 years because the robber barons took over education.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:32.920]  They are social Darwinists. They believe you're animals and they're doing the world
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:37.160]  a favor to kill you. And if you buy into their programming, you deserve it.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:42.840]  That's why Kesha and every major rapper now openly worships Satan and teaches people how
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:47.720]  to commit suicide. And it's 10-year-old girls, mothers, buy them the downloads,
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.240]  here, listen and learn how to commit suicide. Then suicide upticks and they go,
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:56.760]  we wanna test all Americans for suicide and put you on drugs. Congress is looking at that right
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:04.520]  now. See, it's a psychological, spiritual virus they load into you to make you not have a life
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:09.160]  force or to make you hate yourself. And I talked to the trendies, they go, well, there are too many
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.920]  people. And I guess there are too many Africans. And I go, but I, so socialist healthcare is for
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:19.240]  eugenics. Well, we can't pay for all these old people. Really, you can't just grow the pie?
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:23.160]  Well, it's hurting the Earth. Really? The globalists are blocking real technological
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:27.560]  development that would help the Earth. They're the worst for the environment.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:32.280]  And they'll go, well, there are too many people. And I go, do you understand you're under attack
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:38.040]  too? Don't you get that? That you know this is going on. I mean, that's the message I wanna get
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:43.240]  out there. What you're seeing is the building of a world government to carry out the orderly
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:49.880]  forced population reduction by very accelerated bioweapon and chemical means. And you're seeing
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.360]  the ambient background turned up as more and more people get sick and die right now.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.120]  And it's just gonna get more and more and more insane very, very quickly.
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  And again, this is the reality. I can't lie to you. They wanna incrementally show you the reality
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.640]  so you titrate the dose. How do people that handle snakes get used to being able to be bit by them?
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:17.560]  They give them small amounts and build it up. That's titrating the dose. You're giving more
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.400]  and more evil, more and more evil, more and more evil where they can be, yeah, we just take babies
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.760]  and throw them in toilets. And yeah, we kill foster kids with pesticides. And yeah, we torture
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:30.920]  people's kids in front of them, but it's USA, USA. And yeah, we're gonna declare martial law
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.960]  over city and search all your houses. And we're gonna burn Dorner down and lie to you about it.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:39.800]  And yeah, we're gonna do forced inoculations. And yeah, we're gonna give no bid contracts
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:46.520]  to congressman's wives for billions of dollars. And we're gonna confiscate your guns, but we're
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.320]  not gonna confiscate your guns. And see, now they've just got you where everybody's like,
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:54.120]  well, I guess they lie. I don't know what the truth is. I don't know what the.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:02.040]  And that's why I get so angry because I'm trying to shake people out of the complacency here.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:07.720]  Cuz they've incrementally built it up, built it up, built it up, built it up, built it up,
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:13.080]  built it up to where in the movies, people find out they're in the matrix. So they find out
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:19.480]  they're in oblivion and they wake up and do something. But I mean, take the oblivion plot
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:22.440]  line. Instead of Tom Cruise finding out what's really going on and firing against it, he'd be
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  like, well, I guess I'll just try to live out as a slave of this thing that's gonna kill everybody.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.600]  Just cuz I feel like I'm on the winning team. It might kill me in ten weeks.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:35.720]  But I wanna imagine I'm with the winning team, because that's really what would happen.
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:43.800]  I mean, you are under attack. Pure evil. Once you get a tyranny in place,
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.400]  only the most evil can be allowed to get into the position of power, the top of the pyramid.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:52.040]  You can have somebody really bad, but as soon as somebody else even worse gets in,
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.960]  they'll get in. And then they'll get in, they'll get in until you get absolute crystalline,
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:03.640]  pure unadulterated death in control. What's at the bottom of the rabbit hole, Illuminati?
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.920]  Death. What's at the bottom of God's rabbit hole? Eternal life,
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:13.960]  just accelerated intelligence. The whole universe opened up in a trillion realities.
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:22.520]  Just everything good, everything transcendent, everything, the poetry flowing
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:28.120]  versus people stomping around, bugging their eyes out, wearing black uniforms,
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:33.400]  trying to reflect the darkness. You're not even the darkness. You try to reflect it

[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:27.720]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now. And then coming up, oops,
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:34.360]  Ryerson's suspect released, was he framed? Of course, and I told you, they always launch an
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:39.560]  anthrax Ryerson attack during the terror attack to make Congress be part of the narrative like
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:43.720]  they're victims too. That's the script, and I told you that would end up being fake.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.000]  They always have multiple patsies. They'll probably kill the third patsy. For some reason,
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.200]  they're pathological. Big sis pushes citizenship for illegals,
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:55.000]  politico, immigration law would secure democratic victories for generation electoral shift.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.680]  Tying it to a racial system, tying it to socialism,
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:06.520]  tying it to the globalist conquering of America. That's what that is, divide and conquer.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.520]  Shelly, thanks for holding. You wanna talk about gun control and martial law?
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:11.960]  Thank you for joining us. Go ahead.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:21.000]  Hey, Alex Jones. Got a question for you. This is about population control. I remember you and
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.200]  Joel Skeleton talking about the government's need to disarm the country and to get as many
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:32.520]  on welfare as possible before they drop the hammer on the citizens. So my question is about
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:39.800]  one of those hammers. Would you agree that there is a connection between the DHS buildup
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:48.040]  and the race for martial law and the common icing that astrophysicist James McCaney says
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:53.640]  has the risk of sending the EMP and knocking out our grid system, causing all kind of chaos and
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:02:00.440]  mass deaths over time. And the government's need to maintain as much control as possible
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:06.280]  before this event occurs. Well, man, there's a lot of people worried
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:10.840]  about EMPs. They try to predict them or solar flares. They do happen, it is a threat,
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.840]  but it's always right around the corner. And so it's basically used as a way to always,
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:17.960]  oh, it's the end of the world. So what, why should I be involved anyways?
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:24.360]  So that's what I see on that front. Basically, the government's gearing up with all this police state
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.280]  because they've already stolen all the money. They're bringing in a world government.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:32.040]  We're being cold bloodedly conquered right now. And they're gonna bring in populations
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.360]  from all over the world that are accustomed to living as slaves who will then accept,
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:41.960]  you know, being slaves. America is going into bondage because the new world order is all about
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:47.640]  global slavery, global bondage, and they can't have any, you know, of us being free when
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:53.480]  everybody else is slaves. Okay, so you don't really think that this is a peripheral issue
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:56.520]  with this common icing? Absolutely, it's pure crap.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.160]  Okay, all right. No, but I'm glad you brought that up. I mean,
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:04.120]  they have real asteroids, real comets that come by, real things hit us.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:08.200]  But you're just always hearing it's the end of the world with 2012 and it's always the end of
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:13.160]  the world. And it's just like, it's a serialized deal people do. It's the end of humanity happening
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:18.520]  incrementally right now. It's the slow death that's hard to beat. Our shields are up for
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:28.680]  the big frontal assault. It's the slow knife that slips through our shield. You understand
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:34.520]  what I'm saying? Thank you for the call, ma'am. And don't think I'm poo-pooing you for bringing
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:38.840]  that up. I'm glad you brought it up. Lucy, in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:48.600]  Hi, I'm calling about an article you had on Infowars yesterday about the younger brother and how he posted on Facebook.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:55.160]  Yes. There's a lot more to that story. I actually saw the posting early that morning before he was
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:04:01.240]  arrested. And I wanted to get a hold of you to send you some photos of pages that they replaced
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:12.840]  his with. Do you have your tip line? Yes, we'll put you on hold, guys. You have the tip line
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.800]  hanging up on the wall in there and we can give that tip line number out to you, ma'am.
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:22.440]  Would you like to know what happened? Sure, you're on the air.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:30.040]  That morning, I went on Facebook to look at his page because I was reading an article on MSN
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:36.360]  that said he used social media. And I was just curious about him. And I saw the posting that he
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.720]  made. And so I showed it to my son. And then I went and wrote it down. I should have taken a
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:48.360]  photo of it, but you have the photo of it already. Then I looked up his brother's page. And that one
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:54.360]  was basically empty. There wasn't any photos or pictures of his friends or anything on it. So I
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:05:01.400]  went back to what's his name? All right, well, thank you. Very interesting. We'll look into it.

[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:22.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:42.360]  We've been raised watching television. I call it television sickness and we all suffer from it.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:45.640]  You go out in public, people don't even talk to each other.
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:52.360]  All they do is just click their iPads and iPhones made by slaves in China.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.840]  And we're turning away from our humanity. We're in a desperate situation. I have a stack of news
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:05.080]  here about what's happening to us physically. People call that negative. I'm supposed to just
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:09.800]  turn away from everybody, turn away from myself, turn away from my futures, my children's future,
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:16.200]  and just embrace all the liars and all the weird psycho scum like Janet Napolitano that craves
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:23.160]  running our life and just turn our world over to the very worst people. Janet Napolitano,
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:29.160]  immigration bill, important step, though obviously she hasn't read the 800-page bill.
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.280]  Politico says it will cause a generational shift and guaranteed Democratic takeover of everything.
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:37.800]  It's globalist takeover to foreigners. Hey, come in, we'll give you free stuff
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:41.080]  cuz you come from countries where no guns are allowed and you're slaves.
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:46.600]  You wanna help bring down America? Come on. And if you actually downloaded info into these
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:51.480]  foreigners about liberty and freedom and taught them, it wouldn't be that big of a problem.
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:56.680]  But it's just the end of the country. But I mean, by then it won't even matter, folks. The
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:02.520]  globalist are accelerating their entire program so fast right now to pull everything down and then
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:07.240]  have national security states around them, protecting them while they implode you and
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:13.240]  your family as an act of domination and control. And I just look at the slug-like demonic
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:20.280]  evil with her Superman hair and everything of Janet Napolitano and all her lies and all
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:25.560]  the stuff she stages. And it's all just filth, just filth ruling over us.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:32.520]  Internet security bill, the total takeover into free speech,
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:37.800]  CISPA moves to the Senate. Employees will be forced to divulge Facebook passwords.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.440]  That's cuz the companies are all gonna be being paid to data mine you. It's all about getting
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.480]  paid to spy to make it ubiquitous, then the law, then not pay you anymore. It's how slavery works.
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:54.200]  And it just continues on from that point. And good people are standing down,
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.520]  and criminality is just overrunning us at every level.
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:05.240]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls. Paul in Ontario, Canada, you're on the air. Thanks for
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:09.560]  holding. Hey, Alex, how you doing? I kind of got into a ranting mood today.
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:17.080]  I noticed. Anyways, you had a post up on Infowars. It was a link to the Opie and Anthony show. I
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:21.880]  just talked to an innocuous clip. I ended up listening at the 250 mark while this eyewitness
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:25.480]  is recounting his experience. You hear police radio in the background.
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.560]  Yeah, I noticed that. I don't even know why Steve Watson, I think he was updating this morning,
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:36.600]  even put that up. I mean, cuz it says eyewitness recounts. And it's funny, I listened to it this
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:42.280]  morning. And it sounds like a cop putting out an official story. And we've seen a lot of that,
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:46.520]  cuz there's a lot of other witnesses saying they ran over the guy with the car, they shot him up,
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:52.680]  and things like that. And so yeah, you're right. I actually heard that in there.
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:56.120]  And I remember noticing, and I was driving in in the morning, listening to that clip,
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:00.520]  I had it plugged into my dash, listening to the YouTube video. And I heard that as well.
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:04.360]  Yeah, at about the four-minute mark, there's another point where he says, and this was
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:08.600]  a show that was on Monday, and the event was Friday, right? There's one point where he says,
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.800]  oh, my truck is probably riddled with bullet holes. You couldn't go outside all Friday,
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.160]  so you decided not to go on Saturday, Sunday, or Monday morning? He didn't drive,
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:21.240]  he didn't even go check on his car? It's funny, and I'm also bashed on the clip,
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:27.400]  which if I don't mind, I didn't listen to the whole thing. But I did notice all that.
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:31.960]  Yes, sir, I did notice that. It meant to make a note of it. In fact, I'll give you another
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.600]  note of it. In fact, I'll give people the exact headline. I think it's like witness to
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:45.160]  shootout, or it'll be in the archive, the featured news archive link, guys, there,
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:48.840]  and I'll come show you where it is. Significant as anything else you said,
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.000]  I just figured it's another piece of the puzzle, why not throw it out there, right?
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:56.360]  Yeah, I actually thought I heard that what you said. I'm just so busy, I never even checked
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:01.960]  into it. So it looks like even though, I mean, maybe Steve Watson was trying to quote show both
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:05.720]  sides. I don't know, cuz we had witnesses up there yesterday saying they laid him out,
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:08.680]  basically shot him up and ran the car over him, but government wouldn't do that.
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.800]  I mean, they do medical experiments on little kids and murder them, but that's loving.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.960]  In fact, maybe we should have a national day of thanks for all the troops, the government
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:25.160]  nerve gassed to death in different programs like Porton Down and Project Shad and other stuff. I
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:31.240]  mean, there it is, eyewitness describes Watertown shootout. And guys, go to the two, what is it,
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.480]  250 mark, you said? Yeah, 250 in three minutes, there's a police radio going on,
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:37.480]  and about four minutes is where he makes the remark about his car.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:46.280]  Yeah, well, the police don't engage in psyops, so I think we should worship government,
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:51.400]  thank you for the call. Very extreme phone call there. I mean, we all heard the police say,
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.800]  let's burn his cabin down, burn that down, burn that bleeper down, burn it down. Okay,
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:59.720]  we're getting the fire to burn it down. Okay, we're placing the fire, it's ignited,
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:05.480]  it's burning down. But first they said that those tapes weren't real, and they said, well,
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:10.680]  they're real, but we didn't mean that. And everything's fine. And again, I say take more
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:15.720]  shots and drink more fluoride water and eat more GMO, even though it kills the rats in the studies.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:22.680]  Okay, Samuel in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead. Hey, I've been listening to you guys
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.680]  over the past couple days and I don't know if you noticed this, but if you look at the two pictures
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:31.400]  of the Boston bombing suspects that they have with the backpacks on, one of them has a gray
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.800]  backpack, the other one has a white backpack, but the backpack with the bomb in it was black.
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:39.240]  Yep, no, no, both the bombs were in black backpacks, and we have people there at the
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.240]  scene with the exact same backpacks. And you had everybody there with black backpacks,
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.840]  it was part of the drill so that nobody found the real bomb. And then the CNN was quick to say,
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:53.720]  well, we're sure they unzipped it with the pressure cooker, though we're doing a behind
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:57.880]  the scenes study with that very pressure cooker. Looks like you couldn't cram it in there and then
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:03.880]  put it in another backpack, plus they had small backpacks. If the glove doesn't fit, you must quit.
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:10.280]  Yeah, another thing that I forgot to tell while they were asking what I was gonna say,
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:14.680]  is there's actually more about the Federal Reserve. I don't know if you ever heard of
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:19.560]  executive order 1110? Yeah, Kennedy signed it, and one month later they blew his head
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:23.560]  off in front of everybody, and they had guys lined up with guns like a firing squad, and
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:28.920]  over 100 people saw it. And then so they murdered all those people, and it's even on the film,
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:34.040]  you see the poofs of smoke, and you've been at the grassy knoll, I mean, it's like 30 yards
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:38.760]  to Kennedy. And everybody saw it, the policemen all ran up there, but you know what government
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:43.480]  loves is, sir, I mean, look, the government, again, taking foster children and murdering
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:49.240]  them in radiation and pesticide tests, even just a few years ago, is loving. So they would never
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:57.320]  kill a president, okay? Another thing I just wanna say, I probably listen to you almost every day,
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:02.680]  and I'm actually 14 years old, and when I first started talking about stuff like this,
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:09.320]  people, it was kind of annoying or embarrassing, but I just learned not to care anymore, or people
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:15.640]  can be, I mean, you probably have so many people that hate you, or make fun of you,
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:22.920]  or call you crazy, or stuff like this, but- No, no, they're the ones that are crazy. Look
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:30.520]  at this CNN news story, teacher sues school over suspension for weapons charge, showing students
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.800]  gardening tools to teach them how to garden. I mean, I saw a story where the valedictorian
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:41.400]  got her diploma taken for a year, had to go back to school, because on the last day of school,
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:48.360]  she brought a pie, I think it was key lime, to school to go to her teacher's after school party,
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:52.040]  that's the teacher's pet, to cut it up and give pie.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:59.400]  But the good news is that the security guard walked by, saw the plastic pixie butter knife,
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:05.560]  and made the arrest. And then I saw another case where it was salutatory and had a,
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:09.560]  was moving out that next day to go to college. They were already getting into summer school
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:17.080]  college, the salutatorian, and she again had a set of knives, forks, and spoons with butter knives
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:23.480]  with a slightly serrated edge. The security guard, the slave guard, saw that, and the arrest was
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:29.080]  made. And of course, we've all heard about those stories. Isn't that good, sir? You don't wanna be
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:38.920]  an extremist, do you? Yeah, back in the 40s, no one hated guns, I don't understand. When do we
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:44.840]  fail our generation with weapons? I mean weapons- Sir, here's the deal, none of it makes sense
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:50.680]  cuz it's not meant to. Psych warfare chiefs, whose religion is eugenics, are in control.
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:55.880]  And they've got delusions of grandeur how they're going to merge with machines and live forever.
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:59.880]  I don't know if that's really gonna happen. That's their public plan. Ray Kurzweil, all of them.
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:04.440]  Watch my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement. All the big billionaires, they're
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.080]  in the globalist club, give tens of millions a year to these big laboratories and think tanks.
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:13.800]  Cuz when you got everything, what do you want? More life. What does Roy Batty want at Tyrell
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:21.640]  Corporation in Blade Runner? What's he want? What's he want, Samuel? I don't know. I want more life.
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:24.920]  And then he adds an ex-completive to it.
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:29.720]  New Jersey is the worst. Cuz I mean, I went down to Cabela's in Pennsylvania,
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:34.280]  and bought a BB gun. It was like 50 bucks. I go down to a display and goes to New Jersey,
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:39.320]  do the same exact BB gun with a state of the art trigger guard with bulletproof glass on it.
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:42.840]  So no one can get to the BB gun. I mean, it's a BB gun.
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:46.920]  Well, no, no, no, no, no. Citizens with the image of a gun must be
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:53.400]  illegalized. Illegalized, I'm inventing words, must be made illegal. But then government armed
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.280]  with the teeth, violating our rights, that must be made the ambrosia of liberty. See,
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:04.440]  USA-USA Liberty is a city under martial law with housewives being drug out at gunpoint and cops
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:09.240]  shoving them up against walls in the sacrament of power. Cuz if they can shove you up against a wall,
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:13.080]  they can take your kids, and they can do that for no reason. They can make you take shots,
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:17.000]  and they can take your bank account cuz you're not needed anymore. And those cops aren't gonna
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.800]  be needed anymore soon with the robots, and the robotics, and the drones, and the drone submarines,
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:25.640]  the drone ships, the drone aircraft, the combat robots on the ground.
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:29.400]  It's over. The decision's been made to poison us, dumb us down,
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:37.560]  just put out so much garbage on media. No one can tell the difference between real death and
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:44.440]  simulated death or just a bunch of brainwashed zombies drooling waiting for the end. Well,
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.960]  not me. I'm not going down without a fight, ladies and gentlemen, and it's an info war.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:56.520]  Thank you for the call. All right, let's go to Jeff and Julie, and we'll go to Marty and Jim and
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:01.000]  many other straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones. Wake up or lay down and die.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.240]  Bills in front of Congress right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms.

[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:15.080]  possibly by executive order. The best way to keep your guns is to hide them. When Obama can't find,

[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.880]  All emergencies have casualties, but in America, most casualties from storms like Katrina and Sandy
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:44.440]  only happen because good people were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Don't let that happen to

[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:50.680]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:59.960]  The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:37.720]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986,
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:41.880]  yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:46.200]  is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:52.200]  gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:23:00.120]  low returns. Call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:05.800]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:11.880]  Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:18.600]  I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:24.200]  than gold in a crisis. Ninety-seven percent of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:29.000]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that you may not survive
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:33.800]  without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:37.320]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:43.160]  for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:48.120]  most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:51.560]  thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:57.080]  Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:10.440]  Again, that's crisis123.com.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.080]  All right, let's continue with your phone calls. I'll get into more news coming up,
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:15.800]  and I will spend a few minutes talking about oblivion, but I'm so wound up now.
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:20.360]  I may do it on the nightly news tonight. Do it properly. We're going to play a clip coming up.
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:25.000]  It's on drugsreport.com at the news website politico.com, and it's titled,
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.560]  Ted Cruz asked Janet Napolitano if she's read the immigration bill.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:35.640]  So we're going to cover that right now. Let's go to Jeff in Texas. Jeff, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:40.280]  Yeah, turn your radio off, bud. Give me a favor.
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:44.520]  Okay, that's not going to work. They got him. How are you doing today?
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:51.320]  I'm doing all right. Go ahead. Hey, yeah, I've been awake since about, let's see, when
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:58.600]  George Bush Jr. became our president, and I got awake when he wouldn't close the borders down,
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.920]  when he said all the terrorists were coming in, and the guy wouldn't close the borders,
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:08.680]  and I'd be like, okay, there's supposed to be a terrorist threat, but you won't close our borders.
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:12.280]  I mean, it's just all totally meant to be transparent. They're just training us.
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:16.440]  They're going to ask for mass sacrifice of our kids soon publicly. I'm telling you,
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:19.480]  people don't believe that. They're already saying kill babies up to age three.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.000]  Ha, ha, ha, the baby drowned in the toilet. Kill the babies. Kill, kill, kill.
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:29.320]  I mean, it's just a bunch of sick freaks. You're right. In the Illuminati, I did a video
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:36.680]  called 2012 Illuminati Movie and Game Awards, and I showed in all these movies with GI Joe,
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:44.920]  with Cobra taking over the White House, with Bruce Wayne being in a female camp, with the game,
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:49.400]  what is it called, Rainbow Sticks Patriots. Have you seen that game?
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:53.640]  No, but I've heard about it, where they put you in camps and torture people.
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:02.440]  No, in the game, if you look up the trailer when you get a chance and show it, it shows the
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:09.240]  Patriots strapping a bomb to a banker and saying, we're tired of you bankers controlling the US.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:15.320]  We Patriots need to take over and they throw the banker out of the window and blow him up. And the
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:21.720]  Patriots are the bad guys. Yeah, but I think on that show and a bunch of others that video game,
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:26.440]  there's a bunch of them, because I've seen the clips where the Patriots are the terrorist,
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:30.920]  but also get put in the camp. And then you torture the militia man as a US Army person
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:37.640]  to save the children. Yeah, I haven't seen all that, but also with the movie Hunger Games.
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.240]  To me, that's a movie that's just showing where they want the US to go.
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:46.360]  No, that's actually in the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996, the full one. I have
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:50.040]  screenshots of my film Road to Tyranny. I had to go to UT to get the actual document,
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.840]  the full document, not just the boil down. And it said, we wanna bring in world government
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:59.720]  and reestablish gladiatorial games and human sacrifice to reduce world population.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:05.480]  And also you were talking about internment, resettlement. Well, I go to the website and
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:13.320]  type it in, and guess what comes up? Goarmy.com, career and jobs, internment, resettlement,
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:18.280]  specialist. And in it, it shows how to process your social security number, how to break the
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:24.120]  families up, and how to put, it says people that are politically a problem, how to quote,
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:31.000]  reeducate them. Well, if I may read, the job duties are supervision of confinement and
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:38.440]  detention operations, internal security to facilities. And this one kinda blew my mind.
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:46.120]  Counseling guidance to individual prisoners within a rehabilitation program, nice.
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:52.760]  Yes, sir, I hear you. All right, well, thank you, Alex.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.720]  We're gonna go back to more of your phone calls here. We're just doing our best to get people
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:04.200]  thinking, to get people understanding what's happening and what's going on in our society.
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:07.560]  And today we played earlier in the show three different clips that Darren McBrain
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:13.480]  put together. We played those a lot for people on air that show all the martial law stuff going on.
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:21.000]  One of them is called home searches. Yeah, there you go. And for TV viewers and people pointing
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.400]  guns at you and people being drug out of their houses and drugsreport.com is linked to these
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:30.360]  videos and articles right now. And this physically gets to me because I know this is real.
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:33.320]  I know this is happening. This isn't about entertainment, it's not about a show.
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:38.920]  They use the Muslim threat that they manufactured as the pretext to set up a police state that's
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:43.640]  always been aimed at us. And it's all about a bunch of guys playing soldier. They're the new
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:49.480]  superclass. We're the general public scum, government is God. They get the red carpet,
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:53.720]  they're the movie stars. We're gonna go to break and come back with Julie, Marty,
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.520]  Chris, and Jim. That'll be it for calls until the nightly news, 7 o'clock central.
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:03.960]  Cuz I wanna hit a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet. But hey, don't forget this is all going
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:09.160]  on here at Huffington Post celebrating on Sunday, California gun confiscation bill passes. This is
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:13.320]  not an Alex Jones article, they're very proud of it. Approves 24 million to ask about illegal
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:18.920]  gun seizure. And it says if you've ever visited a psychologist period, you'll have your guns taken,
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:23.880]  you're being declared mentally ill. And many different semi-autos or illegal periods, you'll
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:28.600]  be getting SWAT team rated to scare everybody else and turning them in, SB140. And that's just
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:33.240]  the beginning of the funding. They do not obtain search warrants. It actually says that, they're
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:37.400]  very proud of that in the article right here. It actually says do not obtain search warrants.
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:42.120]  There's no more warrants, fourth of them it's gone for that as well. And it's just all the
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:45.720]  new freedoms. So I hope you all enjoy that, they're the model. But no one wants your guns
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:50.200]  though. And this is not an assault, don't run, we are your friends in the Tet Offensive, you know.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:56.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:06.680]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and
[02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:12.360]  floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:17.320]  drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:22.840]  don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are, we all are. Food shortages drive prices up

[02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:11.720]  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security begins with hometown security.
[02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:22.440]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scarring
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:30.200]  particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes. To recap those revisions, women
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:39.480]  are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets, but teenagers now rack up 40 points
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:50.120]  and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points. The big score, anyone, any sex over 75 years old
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:34:00.440]  has been up to 100 points. As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:10.440]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:21.960]  All right, I don't want to spend all day on the film oblivion that I saw last night because I got
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:26.680]  a bunch of news to get to in your calls and I pretty much did the review in the first hour
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:29.720]  because I always talk about something coming up and then just do it right there on the spot
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:35.720]  because all the data is right there. I'm not really a Tom Cruise fan and I know about him
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:41.720]  behind the scenes telling old friends and stuff, I won't be your friend anymore unless you join
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:53.480]  Scientology. But that separately, the directors and the writers who wrote it together, Joseph
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:35:01.560]  Kaczynski and Arvid Nelson, most of the reviews out there, in fact, I printed off some of them
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:07.800]  right here, come out and say that oblivion occupies an awkward no man's land between
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:12.040]  escapist space adventure and heavy science fiction. But it's either thrilling enough
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:17.080]  nor intellectually stimulating enough to satisfy devotees of either, that's NPR.
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:24.200]  Coming from the Black Pyramid, that's what I expected to say. New York Post,
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:30.200]  oblivion is one of those movies in which the main source of interest is simply in figuring
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:34.280]  out what's actually going on, though when you do your reaction is bound to be a shrug.
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:41.320]  It's pleasantly complicated, head spinning plot based on the director Joseph
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:48.280]  Kaczynski's graphic novel is asking a little too much. Was Cruise trying to beat out fellow
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:53.800]  Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi epic ever?
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:36:01.960]  I mean, folks, almost all the reviews are incredibly negative concerning oblivion.
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:07.400]  And what I'm gonna do is cuz I recorded a bunch of points last night this morning that I wanted
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:12.680]  to write down and only got to like one of the sheets. And we're just running out of time here,
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:17.640]  I got too much important news to cover. This movie just absolutely, and I don't just say this,
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:26.120]  I mean, I study what the globalists write and say to the point of just not even knowing what
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:30.840]  to do anymore. I mean, their open criminal operation against us is so diabolical,
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:38.440]  so public, so disgusting, so crazy. We're living in a science fiction movie.
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:45.960]  And what do you think devil worshipers would do with a bunch of high technology?
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.280]  They try to exterminate the majority of the public, merge with machines to become gods,
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:37:01.640]  that's it. And that's the reason you see this in so many science fiction films and so many things
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:06.680]  is that is what they're into, that's what they believe.
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:11.640]  But usually it's done from a two sided position like The Matrix and the Wachowski brothers.
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:18.840]  This film and the two gentlemen that wrote it, that have only been in Hollywood about six,
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:24.760]  seven years, have done a lot of really impressive work. It's their graphic talent that brought them
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:29.080]  to the point of being able to put out their first major film. And it's a tour de force,
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:34.920]  it is a anti Illuminati tour de force. And people just do not get the archetypes.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.280]  I mean, I remember when episode three came out Revenge of the Sith, which again,
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.240]  those are cheesy movies for children. I'm more a fan of the cheesy dialogue,
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:49.080]  kind of like I'm a fan of Airplane. It's not like I'm saying it's some great thing. It's just
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:53.240]  the archetypes that are important though, even in something like Airplane.
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:38:00.120]  From a comedy perspective, the archetypes in episode three are the best of all the films.
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:05.720]  This senator has become the head of the Senate by staging terror attacks on himself.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:12.440]  And then he uses the police state to wipe out the Jedi and in the republic.
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:18.280]  And then I saw the film and couldn't believe it. And then Lucas came out and talked about it and
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:23.880]  said, this is what's really going on with 9-11, obviously a 9-11 truther. You say what you want
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:30.040]  about Lucas, he's a big fan of THX 1138. Well, he made THX 1138. That's kind of a remake adaptation
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:35.880]  of Brave New World, which is actually a real transhumanist globalist plan. 1932, Aldous Huxley,
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:39.240]  carried out by the main head of the World Eugenics Society.
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:43.320]  Julian Huxley, his brother, to later be the head of the United Nations UNESCO program,
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.200]  which is the real head of the UN. That's the Eugenics Department for World Standardization
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:55.080]  for 10-21 projects. So exhausting to know. I mean, it's like I start talking about this
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.240]  and thousands of data points open up as the frustration. So they believe that they're
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:03.240]  gonna become God men. They believe they're setting all this up and they're following
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:12.120]  1850, 1850s is when this was hatched, so 160 plus years.
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:21.720]  They are following a program hatched by Galton, spun off from Malthus, Sir Malthus,
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:28.840]  and picked up then kind of in the age of science fiction, projecting with a Fabian socialist,
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:35.640]  what could be possible. And then what man imagines, man can later build,
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:40.040]  and they've come to the consensus, as so many of their writers have talked about.
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:44.520]  I talk about why the future doesn't need us a lot. In Wired Magazine, April 2000, Bill Joy,
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:49.560]  talked about it hundreds of times, cuz you can go read that. He goes to a globalist conference,
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:53.400]  there's 200 top tech people there. They have a discussion, do we kill everybody?
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:58.200]  That's better for the Earth, or do we let people just play video games all day?
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:04.360]  And become fat blobs like Wall-E, where it's a computerized system taking care of people that
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:08.760]  can't even walk. And that's where it's going. No, they're not gonna put you in the trance state,
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:13.400]  so you can drink pina coladas on the deck of a star cruiser. They're already killing us,
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:20.040]  the decision has been made. And they're going towards a hotter program.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.560]  And by a hotter program, a faster program. And I know I just keep an emergency beacon going,
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:30.120]  emergency, emergency, emergency. To the point of I just can't be around people
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:34.440]  who don't take this serious anymore. And you know what, I can become
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:39.800]  really aggressive too and everything, because I'm in combat, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:44.920]  I know I'm right. And it is so exhausting to care about humanity, to care about you and your family,
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:49.480]  to care about you and your children, because I just want survival. I mean, I'm right about this.
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:57.320]  And you have to make the decision to research it so you know what's going on. Everyone I know,
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:40:59.400]  all over the country, has been sick for a year.
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:06.600]  I have seen more sickness in people I know and people in town, everyone they know,
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:10.680]  in the last eight months. And there's numbers out, I've got numbers out.
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:16.440]  The deaths, the obesity, the sickness, the allergies, they're killing us.
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:24.280]  Exactly what you see, first generation rodents fed one GMO crop. Every GMO crop does this,
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:30.520]  it's cross species, or well, they're all cross species that produce their own poison.
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:37.800]  I mean, let me explain something. If bees can't eat the pollen off a corn plant,
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.960]  cuz it kills them cuz it grows its own pesticide, but you're supposed to be able to eat that.
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:48.040]  I mean, most of our livers are the size of baby stingrays right now. I mean, we are under mega
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:54.120]  attack, ladies and gentlemen, and I am just a desperate, primitive human. And by primitive,
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:58.040]  that's more advanced than what we are now. I'm just a primitive person with life force
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:04.120]  directives that is just sitting here going, my God, they're openly admitting this whole program.
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:12.440]  And then I see something like oblivion that, I mean, just every 30 seconds
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:21.240]  was a different archetype message, and it was all positive. And it was about
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:30.360]  rebirth and regeneration and the children, but also in the genetics there being memories,
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:40.360]  which has been proven. And the cold blooded psychopath system versus love, and the soul,
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:46.840]  and how compartmentalization is used to control everybody.
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:43:07.000]  And it is just beyond insane. And I just feel an overriding responsibility to try to stop this. I
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:14.120]  mean, I can hardly be around my children because they're so innocent, they're so good. And it
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:20.680]  doesn't even make me angry when I think about the New World Order now, it is so evil. And most of
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:24.520]  the people that are part of it are just ego maniacs on power trips. And I think about how
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:29.000]  the technocrats have done this through compartmentalization, through testing, and they're
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  able to see what people do in local departments that then promote them to state and then federal,
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.600]  then international. And when you get to the top of the pyramid, they just write books about us
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:42.360]  talking about how we're animals they're gonna kill. And then I even talk to yuppies and they
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:47.240]  go, yeah, we are dumb, ugly animals. Humanity's ugly and dumb and we need to die. And I said,
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:50.840]  but if I right now tried to kill you, you would fight for your life and call the police.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:55.720]  And they don't even know what to say. They're like, I say this to people, are you threatening
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:59.880]  me? And I go, don't be an intellectual dimwit. You're supposed to be this big, smart liberal
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:05.160]  who's really an authoritarian. You just said we all need to die, but you're gonna fight if I
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:10.200]  attack you, right? Well, of course I am. And I go, well, then why have you bought into something?
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:14.680]  You don't just say you're part of this and then not really be part of it.
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:19.960]  Plus you're not part of it. I mean, how many times,
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:22.280]  how many different ways do I have to say this to you?
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:31.640]  I mean, the globalist are opening the borders up to the entire collapsed world that they have
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:36.600]  collapsed with their policies. Bringing in people with no history of freedom to say you get your
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:40.680]  freedom by bringing down the Second Amendment. That is taught now as a sacrament to Latin
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.000]  Americans coming in, that you're gonna have your victory over the gringos when you get their guns.
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:49.000]  When it should be, hey, if you wanna come to America, that's one thing.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:54.200]  The government isn't your friend, you deserve guns, you deserve freedom. But they're tying
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:45:00.040]  their rebellion and their liberty to taking everybody's guns and America being like Mexico
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:09.480]  or Nigeria. Just like they're tying USA, USA, America to having your hands up at your house
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:14.200]  and being treated like a slave and having the cops slam your wife up against the wall.
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:18.040]  Just so they could exercise power and basically plant the flag on Boston.
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:26.840]  You see, the new civil right is giving up all your liberties. The new civil right is being a slave.
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:36.840]  People can be taught to love their servitude, as Aldous Huxley said in 1962 at Berkeley.
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:43.880]  And they have been, and it's just disgusting. You're taught to be a totally domesticated
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:48.360]  jellyfish who can't even play with a water gun or your dad has his guns taken.
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:51.720]  When there's not even a law, they just do it, that's called martial law.
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:56.360]  But then the police can come around and come to your door and you open it,
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:46:00.680]  and they point guns at you and shove you up against the wall when you're a black guy
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:08.600]  or you're a blonde guy. I watched countless videos of somebody go out to their car to get something
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:12.120]  and the cops would run up and shove them up against the deal. And the guy would go like,
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:16.520]  hey, obviously look nothing like the suspect and the cop would slam their head into the car.
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:21.160]  It's just a police riot. People driving around who've always wanted to beat everybody up.
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:24.680]  Now they can come into everybody's neighborhood and do it. Mentally ill people,
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:32.520]  mentally ill, mentally ill. They never get tired of dominating people. They never get tired of
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:36.120]  bullying people. They never get tired. They never get tired. They never get tired.
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:44.600]  And that's what this is all about. It's about turning loose every nobody and giving them
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:50.120]  government power to make us their slaves. And again, I'll add the proviso, not all police are
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:56.440]  bad. No, but in areas where they've got control, they can get away with anything and they are
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:01.640]  getting away. And then Bloomberg, an obvious craven scumbag running around saying we gotta
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:07.640]  get rid of the Constitution to keep you safe. The Constitution is what has produced
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:13.800]  any bit of liberty we have where a man just can't be disappeared cuz the emperor says take him away.
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:21.960]  Now let's go to this clip of Janet Napolitano being asked by Senator Ted Cruz. I gotta say,
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.960]  Ted Cruz was even ready to come on this show when he was running for Senate and I
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:32.920]  didn't like some of the things he did in state government. So even though I hated the guy who
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:37.640]  was running against, I didn't have him on. We interviewed him at the Capitol, so it was on the
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.120]  nightly news. But I tell you, I'm as impressed with what he's been doing as I've been with
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:47.960]  Rand Paul. I mean, I just trust trying to get Ted Cruz on. He's probably too good for us now.
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:51.960]  I'm joking as people say, I'm on the radical show. I was trying to get Rand Paul back. I know
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:58.440]  what Rand Paul's on. I think what Rand Paul's on Thursday. But I'm really impressed with Ted Cruz.
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:06.760]  And let's go ahead and see if Janet's read the 800 page bill. Here it is.
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:15.080]  My office received the text of this bill at 2 25 a.m. on Wednesday, April 17th, five days ago.
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:23.320]  The bill is eight hundred and forty four pages long. It is dealing with a very complicated
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:33.400]  topic. And my first question is, when did did did your office receive a copy of the bill as filed?
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:38.840]  About three o'clock in the morning. I think that's about right. In the five days since then,
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:43.080]  when you have obviously been heavily focused on matters such as the the bill that you're
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:48.040]  currently focused on matters such as the Boston bombing and quite properly focused on on matters
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:53.400]  such as that. Have you had the time to read all eight hundred and forty four pages of the bill?
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:49:00.360]  Actually, I have read the bill. I know many sections of the bill fairly well. So I was able
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:04.440]  to skim those sections, but I have been able to review the bill. Yes, sir.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.160]  Well, OK. And then that has been a busy weekend for you.
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:15.000]  Total bull. Yes, sir. Very busy. Oh, yes. That was a busy with the stuff that goes on at your
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  house. I bet. Oh, we know what happens to the man at your office. I mean, what a monster.
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  Total witchy poo lies. Yeah, and that bill's three hundred something with hundreds of pages
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.800]  of supplementals. We have to go read the code. It's the SOPA that was eight hundred plus that
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:37.800]  people had a couple hours to read. Oh, yes, sir. I did read that. Thank you, Mr. Napolitano. Thank
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:44.280]  you for the. I'm not making fun of women that look like men. It's just that why do all the
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:50.040]  women in the federal government need to look like women that look like men? I mean, is it like maybe
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:55.160]  she's an alien, maybe Janet Reno and her like an alien spacecraft came to Earth, kidnapped some
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:59.720]  people, you know, with the teleporter beams and then just kind of made two or three models.
[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:04.280]  And maybe it's like Mars attack, but it's not like a hot blonde that comes to the White House.
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:09.560]  You unzip, you know, the green alien puts on like an outfit and it's kind of like two or three
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:15.480]  sizes. And it's a woman with a deep voice, with a short haircut, with a white splash in it or
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:20.280]  something. And and the aliens like to make, you know, men do weird sexual stuff at the White
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:25.080]  House. I mean, at the Justice Department. And they make men stay in the toilet and scream at them and
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:29.160]  yell at them all day and run around on power trips while taking copious amounts of testosterone.
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:33.960]  They might as well be an alien. I mean, I don't know. You can't get in the federal government
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:41.000]  now unless you look and act like Janet Napolitano. I mean, I want to know. Yes, I did read that.
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:47.000]  I mean, you know what? I think she's an imposter. I say the head of Homeland Security
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:53.080]  is from Planet Poptart and that it came here in the Tet. I'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:58.600]  Your call's coming up and more news straight ahead in fullwars.com, prisonplanet.tv. This is
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:04.440]  reality based radio. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have to be
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:08.760]  delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them. If they are to be used to create new
[02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:13.160]  proteins in your body, just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:18.520]  brick wall. So, too, your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:23.240]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:28.680]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other. You see, heating bends and
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:34.680]  twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume
[02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:39.480]  are heated. With our true cool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:45.640]  My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old. When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:51.160]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight. I've noticed
[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:55.640]  an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.

[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:04.920]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:10.600]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:14.680]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:18.600]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:23.560]  The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:27.800]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices

[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:11.720]  You know, my issue is this.
[02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:20.440]  I know staged media events when I see it. I know when they're pushing something. And I mean,
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:25.480]  that's obvious. You know it too. And I just know the globalists are a bunch of horrible criminals
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:30.760]  that need to be bound down by the Constitution, as the founders said, and I know that all of the
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:36.840]  good of this country is bleeding out. And again, it makes me upset. Now other people are like,
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:42.200]  oh, take it easy. Well, that's the attitude that slaves have. There are a lot of countries
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:47.320]  where people say, hey, take it easy and they're slaves. So if you don't like aggressive men
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:50.200]  that get angry about becoming slaves, you don't wanna be an American.
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:55.080]  That's what it comes down to. There's breaking news in Infowars.com.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:01.240]  Bunch of breaking news. I said I'd go to calls. Let's go to Clint. No, who's all the longest?
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.560]  Marty and Mass, you're on the air. Go ahead, listening on XM166.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:08.040]  Hey, Alex. Hey, bro.
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:13.960]  Hey, what's up? Keep on the Patriots. And I just heard you briefly said,
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:20.920]  I just heard the Congress, their wife, contract to spy on the American people.
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:31.320]  And the liberal left maybe do the same thing if she goes on XM168. Have you heard of Randy Rhoads?
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:35.720]  She might be doing the same thing, spy on the individual.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.680]  Well, I mean, they use computers to do it. There's a bunch of members of Congress
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:46.440]  whose wives and husbands, and David Knight listed some the other day in a report,
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:51.640]  where companies they head up get, in one case, $10 billion contract.
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:55.480]  And then who knows what they'll get out of that? Probably 50 million, 100 million, who knows?
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:00.120]  But it's usually those type of numbers. I mean, again, insider trading.
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:05.000]  They passed a law saying they could insider trade, so they passed another law saying,
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.760]  well, if we get a waiver, we can, from their own ethics committee.
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:13.800]  And then the head of the ethics committee's wife is involved in this stuff. And then now,
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.440]  they got another law passed getting rid of that, so they're back to insider trading.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:26.120]  I mean, they do stuff, let's not exaggerate, 5,000 times. I mean, just infinitely bigger
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:35.000]  than what Martha Stewart did, and they don't go to jail. That's what I mean. I mean, they're crooks.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:39.640]  They've gotten away with everything. And now, we're wondering why they're getting away with
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:46.040]  even more. Because Thomas Jefferson said, the level of tyranny you will live under
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:51.080]  is the exact amount you will accept. That's a Thomas Jefferson quote.
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:55.160]  And that's exactly true. God bless you, I appreciate your call. Jim in Arkansas,
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:56.920]  you're on the air, sir.
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:26.440]  Well, they got to the bottom of Fast and Furious in Oklahoma City, bless their little hearts.
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:31.240]  When I saw it, I thought, well, we'll get the truth out of that pretty quick.
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:35.000]  And then the other thing that's bothered me for quite some time about the-
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.880]  By the way, I don't know how I do it. I said this guy's a patsy,
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:45.560]  mailing the poison, the Ryerson. And I said, watch, they'll arrest two or three more
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:50.120]  by the time they're done, and that's now happened. I mean, look, they follow handbooks.
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:52.360]  I'm sorry, go ahead. It's scripted.
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:53.240]  Yeah, it's all scripted.
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:59.640]  The other thing is, I've given all my Constitution booklets away that I got from you. But
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:08.760]  doesn't the Constitution allow for the Congress to mark people? Which is,
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:17.960]  it takes an act of Congress to designate someone an enemy of the state and to deal with them.
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:19.080]  Isn't that included in the Constitution?
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:20.200]  Yes, yes.
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:21.640]  It's a wonderful document.
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:26.200]  Yes, and instead, they've handed that authority over to the bureaucracy,
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:33.080]  which they're not allowed to do. You can't do that. Number one, you have to have a
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:37.000]  constitutional convention to do that, okay? They can't just pass the law doing that.
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:38.120]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:44.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:35.400]  Alex Jones. Over the weekend, I shot a video called Black Butterfly's Lie. And people thought
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:40.120]  I was smoking marijuana because it was 420. No, I didn't smoke any marijuana. Or they think I'm
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:45.000]  drunk. No, I had had nothing to drink, though I think I went inside and had one glass of wine
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:52.920]  after this. It's called poetry that came to mind very quickly where we were burning a piece of old
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:58.120]  furniture that we found down in the gully that I guess the last owner of my house, little farmhouse
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:03.320]  had had. It was a rotten piece of furniture. So we made a little fire out in the backyard
[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:06.920]  and burned it and some other stuff. As the kids wanted to make a fire outside,
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:10.360]  it was real pretty spring day and had just been raining the day before, so it was safe to have
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:15.400]  a fire. It's been so dry. And my son found a big piece of cardboard that had blown off the road
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:19.080]  over the barbed wire fence into the yard. And he said, can I throw this on? And I said, yeah,
[03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:24.040]  burn it. And it created all these little black pieces that you see go up in the sky,
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:27.880]  but they're like butterflies. So I shot a quick iPhone saying, oh,
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:31.240]  black butterflies, the government says so. And then I cut to the fact that it's really
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:40.040]  shut out of the fire. And people are in there not even understanding what I'm saying.
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:45.720]  Some do. And it's such a pure, easy to understand allegory or analogy. I mean, come on.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:51.240]  And some people don't get, I mean, that really makes me wonder sometimes. People don't get a
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:55.400]  video I shot last night driving home at about seven. Well, I was driving to meet my dad to
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:02:02.440]  watch Oblivion called Who Says the Stars Only Come Out at Night? And I shot that on my iPhone
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:07.000]  because it was so yellow. The camera didn't pick it up, made it more blue. The whole sky
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:11.560]  was yellow and orange. And it looked just really space agey. So I shot a video of it
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:14.920]  just cuz I think stuff's really cool and pretty. And people don't get what that means.
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:17.000]  I mean, I just like what is going on out there?
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:25.800]  I mean, I just don't understand anymore. Cuz again, I don't think of myself as that smart.
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:29.720]  And I mean, I'm like light years ahead of the general public. And I think it's up to us that
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:34.360]  know how things really work to a certain extent to help the cynical, arrogant, dumb people.
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:38.920]  The other thing is how arrogant, dumb idiots are. I was about to say dumbasses, but I guess I did.
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:42.040]  Let's take another call. Christian, Virginia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:45.720]  Hi, how are you? I'm all right, brother. How are you doing?
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:53.000]  I'm not doing too bad. Hey, I just wanted to ask you if you had gotten a chance to look at
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:03:00.680]  the inconsistencies between the Cambridge report that was posted on the Wall Street Journal and
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:08.680]  then the FBI indictment in terms of the carjacking? I mean, there's a ton of inconsistencies and
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:15.560]  weirdness and things. I mean, the whole story is just a disaster zone and clearly is some type of
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:21.240]  staged event. With these guys working for intelligence and having aliases and definitely
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:25.560]  the older brother. I mean, he was definitely McVade or Lee Harvey Oswald. We don't know all
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:30.680]  the particulars. We just know the pre-build up, the way they handled it after. This was a scripted
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:33.640]  event. They bare minimum knew and let it happen. Bare minimum.
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:40.840]  Absolutely. And the Cambridge report actually states that the younger brother, the two brothers
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:46.040]  were together in a Honda Civic and one of them approached the door to the Mercedes and tapped
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:53.560]  on the window. The FBI report says that only one brother went into the Mercedes and then picked up
[03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:56.920]  the second brother, drove across town to pick up the second brother.
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:03:59.960]  Well, listen, here's the deal. A lot of times they don't know what happened right away. So
[03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:04.680]  that's one reason stories get changed. But they say we're gonna burn Dorner down, then they do it
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:10.360]  and say, we didn't mean that. This is congenital lying. I mean, the Delta Force killed the Branch
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:14.040]  Davidians under orders. They protested it, but followed orders they shouldn't have.
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:19.080]  And that even came out in Congress. The average person doesn't even know that
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:23.160]  because they're so dumbed down. The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:26.760]  And bottom line, get back to the Bill of Rights Constitution, due process,
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:31.480]  checks and balances, and then they can't overrun us. Cut government, cut taxes,
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:36.520]  kick globalist out, abolish the Federal Reserve. There are the solutions. Great call. God bless
[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:41.160]  you, Chris. All right, I gotta go. For Clint, Bill and Robert, I apologize to you.
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:44.280]  And I'm always frustrated with myself because I wanna get to all this news.
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:49.720]  I get overheated, I start ranting and raving. And then by the nighttime show,
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:53.400]  I get a little bit more focused when I'm burned out. But thanks for putting up with me. Nightly
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:05:15.080]  news tonight, 7 o'clock Central, prisonplanet.tv. Be sure and be there, 7 o'clock Central.
