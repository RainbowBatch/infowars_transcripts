[00:00.000 --> 00:26.800]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Alex Jones show.
[00:26.800 --> 00:31.400]  Alex Jones will be joining us here in just a moment.
[00:31.400 --> 00:34.280]  It is Thursday, June 14, 2018.
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.280]  It is President Trump's birthday, and it is the 34-hour broadcast spectacular here at
[00:40.280 --> 00:42.200]  infowars.com slash show.
[00:42.200 --> 00:48.320]  We are expecting the release of the IG report shortly as well, but before we get to that,
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.200]  in case you didn't think that the Democrats had lost their mind, here's a little more
[00:53.200 --> 00:56.120]  evidence for you.
[00:56.120 --> 01:03.040]  In just a few years, he'll be in school, and Donald Trump wants to give his teacher a gun.
[01:03.040 --> 01:08.600]  More students have been killed in school shootings in 2018 than U.S. troops in combat operations.
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.880]  We need common-sense gun control, but that's not enough.
[01:12.880 --> 01:19.200]  There are 310 million guns in the U.S. and millions of assault-style weapons.
[01:19.200 --> 01:20.680]  I'm Levi Tillerman.
[01:20.680 --> 01:24.000]  Washington needs more doers and innovators.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.320]  That's why I'm running for U.S. Congress.
[01:26.320 --> 01:32.280]  I'm calling on Congress to stop talking past each other and try something new, empower
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.680]  schools and teachers with non-legal self-defense tools like this can of pepper spray.
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.680]  Pepper spray doesn't cost much, and it can be safely stored in a break glass in case
[01:43.680 --> 01:50.040]  of emergency cabinet, but it's powerful and won't accidentally kill a kid.
[01:50.040 --> 01:55.320]  Trust me, this will stop anyone in their tracks.
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.640]  Go back to the guy.
[02:00.640 --> 02:02.200]  You cut away for the best part.
[02:02.200 --> 02:03.200]  It's a game of head-and-weep.
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.520]  So there is a Democrat candidate sprays himself.
[02:08.520 --> 02:10.320]  This is in Colorado.
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.000]  Can we rewind it to when he has it all over his face?
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.440]  This is so absurd.
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.720]  I can't even imagine whose idea this was.
[02:20.720 --> 02:24.840]  Roger Stone, you have been in politics for a long, long time.
[02:24.840 --> 02:27.720]  Have you ever seen a more ridiculous campaign ad?
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.200]  Well, the only thing worse than being wrong in politics is being boring, and this is most
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.600]  certainly not boring.
[02:35.600 --> 02:38.280]  It's so ridiculous that it will get media coverage.
[02:38.280 --> 02:43.760]  It will get him earned media coverage.
[02:43.760 --> 02:49.880]  It's the same, take their guns, underlying theme, all Democrats are running against.
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.640]  But this is an underfunded guy trying to get on television, that's how I read it.
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.000]  But you might actually think this is brilliant.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.360]  You think this might actually get him the right kind of publicity he's looking for?
[03:01.360 --> 03:04.480]  Well, I don't think the idea of pepper spray is a great idea.
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.800]  What I'm talking about is the theatrics of spraying yourself in the face to make sure
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.680]  that the local news and that market picks up his spot, or that maybe info wars would
[03:14.680 --> 03:15.680]  even show it.
[03:15.680 --> 03:17.000]  Hey, you know what?
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.800]  I think it's funny that they don't want you to have the right to protect yourself.
[03:20.800 --> 03:25.800]  I think it's funny that they demonize the fact that this country has guns to protect
[03:25.800 --> 03:27.000]  itself in a second amendment.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.440]  That's what's kept it's free.
[03:28.440 --> 03:32.840]  But then I just think it's crazy that a guy would pepper spray himself in the face for
[03:32.840 --> 03:33.840]  a campaign ad.
[03:33.840 --> 03:35.040]  But I guess it was effective.
[03:35.040 --> 03:38.160]  He gets the views he wants, we'll see if it works out for him.
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.680]  But I just think this is more evidence of the Democrats just totally losing their minds
[03:42.680 --> 03:44.440]  and they just don't know what to do anymore.
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.840]  Well, let's check tomorrow and see on YouTube how many views he's got.
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.200]  I think that'll tell you the reason he did this.
[03:51.200 --> 03:52.200]  But I don't know.
[03:52.200 --> 03:54.880]  I feel like maybe he's just in it for YouTube views.
[03:54.880 --> 03:58.920]  But if you're in it to win an election, I don't know if this is the way to go.
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.040]  I guess this is the new thing.
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.120]  Can you torture yourself into a congressional seat?
[04:05.120 --> 04:07.800]  I don't know what the registration looks like.
[04:07.800 --> 04:11.680]  In the district that he's running in, it's a publicity stunt.
[04:11.680 --> 04:14.960]  And maybe it will appeal to leftists.
[04:14.960 --> 04:16.880]  I think he gets a lot of views out of it.
[04:16.880 --> 04:19.280]  I'm not sure he gets a lot of votes out of it.
[04:19.280 --> 04:20.280]  All right.
[04:20.280 --> 04:23.800]  Well, we start the show a little lighthearted today, but we do have a lot of important news
[04:23.800 --> 04:24.800]  to cover.
[04:24.800 --> 04:34.080]  You've got a new New York Attorney General who is trying to shut down the Trump Foundation.
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.520]  This is Barbara Underwood, Underwood.
[04:38.520 --> 04:40.600]  That's from House of Cards.
[04:40.600 --> 04:42.720]  This is the replacement Eric Schneiderman.
[04:42.720 --> 04:45.720]  It is now Barbara Schneider Woman.
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.480]  But you notice how after Schneiderman was out, Weinstein fell and a lot of other pieces
[04:50.480 --> 04:52.280]  fell in New York.
[04:52.280 --> 04:53.280]  Hmm.
[04:53.280 --> 04:55.480]  I wonder if Schneiderman had anything to do with that.
[04:55.480 --> 04:57.080]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[04:57.080 --> 05:00.640]  Don't go anywhere.
