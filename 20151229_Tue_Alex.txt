[00:00.000 --> 00:08.400]  This is the Info War, Big Brother, mainstream media, and we're under attack right now.
[00:08.400 --> 00:09.400]  Cover-ups.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.400]  You want answers?
[00:10.400 --> 00:12.400]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.400 --> 00:23.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.480 --> 00:29.680]  I have a guest who's one of the top people tracking ISIS in Turkey joining us.
[00:29.680 --> 00:36.080]  We have been hit with a wide-scale, across-the-board attempt to take over Info Wars in different
[00:36.080 --> 00:37.080]  accounts today.
[00:37.080 --> 00:41.280]  We'll tell you about the hack attack when we come back after this special report.
[00:41.280 --> 00:43.520]  It's ongoing right now.
[00:43.520 --> 00:44.520]  The ghetto.
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.880]  Not the place you would imagine methods of global dominance to spring from.
[00:48.880 --> 00:54.320]  But it was in the ghettos across the United States that Saul Alinsky would fine-tune tactics
[00:54.320 --> 00:59.800]  of civil disobedience that would one day be employed by New World Order puppet Barack
[00:59.800 --> 01:01.000]  Hussein Obama.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.080]  Resolutions of ideal problems always carry within their wake another problem.
[01:06.080 --> 01:12.040]  Alinsky's rules for radicals is the Left's playbook, chocked full of creeping tactics
[01:12.040 --> 01:18.160]  used by scheming politicians and Soros-fueled millennial generation groups like Black Lives
[01:18.160 --> 01:19.160]  Matter.
[01:19.160 --> 01:29.240]  Hell bent on tearing the fabric of American society apart.
[01:29.240 --> 01:35.360]  Anti-cop rhetoric that is sweeping the United States of America, fueled by this group, some
[01:35.360 --> 01:46.000]  of the vulgar, vile, vicious rhetoric that's coming out, talking about killing cops.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.120]  Alinsky's albeit deceptively noble attempt to create a system to reward the have-nots
[01:51.120 --> 01:56.000]  with the power and surplus of the haves would prove to be just as useful for the New World
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.840]  Order sycophants to achieve an uprooting of American values and an overpass of the United
[02:01.840 --> 02:08.600]  States Constitutional Foundation to be replaced by totalitarianism disguised as compassionate
[02:08.600 --> 02:09.600]  socialism.
[02:09.600 --> 02:26.480]  His tactics simply needed the perfect charismatic turncoat to steer them, enter Barack Obama.
[02:26.480 --> 02:33.080]  Saul Alinsky died decades before a young pre-Senate Barack Obama would spend three years following
[02:33.080 --> 02:36.560]  in Alinsky's footsteps as a community organizer.
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.200]  In 2009, the National Review stated, Obama's mentors from his Chicago days studied at a
[02:42.200 --> 02:47.840]  school Alinsky founded and they taught their students the philosophy and methods of one
[02:47.840 --> 02:50.600]  of the first community organizers.
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.680]  Saul Alinsky wrote in Rules for Radicals, as an organizer I start from where the world
[02:55.680 --> 02:59.440]  is as it is, not as I would like it to be.
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.640]  That we accept the world as it is doesn't in any sense weaken our desire to change it
[03:04.640 --> 03:09.840]  into what we believe it should be, it is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.900]  to change it to what we think it should be.
[03:12.900 --> 03:15.920]  That means working in the system.
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.200]  So what are some of the tactics being utilized in that system at accelerating degrees in
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.200]  the shaping of modern American society?
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.760]  Rule number one, power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.600]  Obama and the nutjobs in the nation's capital would have us all believe that they have
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.080]  overwhelming support from the have-nots while destroying the middle class, increasing the
[03:40.080 --> 03:45.200]  debt and welfare class to unsustainable levels and projecting it all from their mainstream
[03:45.200 --> 03:46.480]  media bubble.
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.520]  Rule number two, never go outside the expertise of your people.
[03:50.520 --> 03:56.320]  Basically, why bother engaging in a rational debate based on facts with your adversary?
[03:56.320 --> 04:02.560]  Simply bring up the despised policies or traditions and belittle them until they are crushed.
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.880]  Less than loving expressions by Christians?
[04:06.880 --> 04:07.880]  I get concerned.
[04:07.880 --> 04:08.880]  That's right.
[04:08.880 --> 04:10.840]  Let's criticize Christianity on Easter, you piece of crap.
[04:10.840 --> 04:12.200]  Best topic for another day.
[04:12.200 --> 04:15.640]  Skipping to rule number eight, keep the pressure on.
[04:15.640 --> 04:16.800]  Never let up.
[04:16.800 --> 04:19.680]  Obama must say this rule to himself every morning.
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.240]  As one shoe drops, another one is ready to fall, not in the manner of a leader responding
[04:24.240 --> 04:30.400]  to a country's pleas in the midst of a crisis, but more in the vein of a tyrant, quietly
[04:30.400 --> 04:36.480]  and charismatically creating them, while offering shallow direction as stale as his predecessor's
[04:36.480 --> 04:37.480]  rhetoric.
[04:37.480 --> 04:43.200]  And if just that sample of Saul Linsky's rules for radicals wasn't enough, Linsky even dedicated
[04:43.200 --> 04:46.200]  the left's playbook to Lucifer himself.
[04:46.200 --> 04:51.240]  I suppose given a choice, I think I would pick hell.
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.680]  The reason I'd pick hell is because that's where all the have-nots are.
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.680]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[04:56.680 --> 04:59.360]  We'll be back.
[04:59.360 --> 05:04.440]  The Afluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.280]  A wealthy Texas teen who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing
[05:09.280 --> 05:14.160]  four people while driving drunk will be returned to the United States after being caught in
[05:14.160 --> 05:15.160]  Mexico.
[05:15.160 --> 05:21.120]  Ethan Couch, AJ Teen and his mother Tanya were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort
[05:21.120 --> 05:22.280]  in Mexico.
[05:22.280 --> 05:27.320]  Couch became known in the United States as the Afluenza teen during his trial in juvenile
[05:27.320 --> 05:33.000]  court over the 2013 deaths, when a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.120]  could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[05:36.120 --> 05:40.960]  He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter, a sentence critics
[05:40.960 --> 05:42.840]  saw as far too light.
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.440]  Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County
[05:47.440 --> 05:50.640]  Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[05:50.640 --> 06:01.720]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[06:01.720 --> 06:07.280]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[06:07.280 --> 06:11.520]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[06:11.520 --> 06:14.200]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[06:14.200 --> 06:19.640]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[06:19.640 --> 06:24.160]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.680]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[06:28.680 --> 06:29.680]  drugs.
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.600]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[06:33.600 --> 06:35.640]  that children would actually like and take.
[06:35.640 --> 06:39.200]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.800]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[06:43.800 --> 06:49.280]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[06:49.280 --> 06:51.320]  nutrients that taste great.
[06:51.320 --> 06:54.600]  Obtain your child ease today at InfowarsLife.com.
[06:54.600 --> 06:58.360]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[06:58.360 --> 07:05.280]  In the 15 year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.920]  We've always offered five months free, but since I announced six free months a few days
[07:10.920 --> 07:14.240]  ago, we have seen record numbers of signups.
[07:14.240 --> 07:17.480]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[07:17.480 --> 07:20.760]  It's grown into Infowars at Nightly News and so much more.
[07:20.760 --> 07:25.840]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books and other exclusive documentaries are available
[07:25.840 --> 07:29.720]  for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[07:29.720 --> 07:33.800]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's.
[07:33.800 --> 07:39.720]  You also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your
[07:39.720 --> 07:40.720]  username.
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.280]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95 and then 20 of you and your
[07:45.280 --> 07:51.080]  friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv, yet 20 memberships at half price be the Paul
[07:51.080 --> 07:52.560]  Revere in your community.
[07:52.560 --> 08:11.480]  That's six months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
