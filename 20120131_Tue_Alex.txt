[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:38.600]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.600 --> 00:46.400]  Oh boy. This is gonna be another incredible transmission today. Guys, will you give me
[00:46.400 --> 00:52.140]  my guest folder, please? Thank you. This is gonna be an incredible transmission today.
[00:52.140 --> 01:03.240]  It is the 31st day. 31st day of January, 2012. Still taking time to get used to that. And
[01:03.240 --> 01:11.120]  the first month of 2012 is almost over. We are going to be here for the next three hours.
[01:11.120 --> 01:18.600]  And you know that Obama was in contempt of court earlier in the week concerning his birth
[01:18.600 --> 01:25.200]  certificate and evidence of the fact that he is truly a natural born citizen.
[01:25.200 --> 01:32.040]  And so we've got Dr. Jerome Corsi popping in to discuss that later on in the transmission
[01:32.040 --> 01:47.840]  with us. And of course, Alan Watt as well is going to be on with us today. Where should
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.760]  I start? Well, when we come back from the break, obviously, I have a lot of election
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.840]  news, economy news, Iran and Syria news, and I will get to all of that.
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.280]  Hillary Clinton is urging Security Council to act on Syria. She just promised a few months
[02:01.280 --> 02:06.280]  ago there wouldn't be any action or talk of military action, but it's no longer military.
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.480]  Libya was not military. Bombing them for six months, putting Al-Qaeda in charge, that was
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.040]  not military. And there won't be any congressional authorization, I guess, for this new peace
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.200]  mission.
[02:18.200 --> 02:23.760]  And the West reportedly has special forces in there advising the admitted Al-Qaeda forces
[02:23.760 --> 02:30.900]  again that works for NATO. And you raise this point with a neocon or somebody and it just
[02:30.900 --> 02:35.240]  doesn't compute. They're like, but I give my rights up and let the TSA grow up my children
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.120]  and wife as a sacrament to fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:39.120 --> 02:42.760]  And then you explain to them, but the government admits they created them and are still using
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.320]  them. And they get all these different Al-Qaeda people on the airplanes and protect them.
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.780]  And Mohammed Atta was brought into the US, Newsweek magazine, and the underwear bomber
[02:51.780 --> 02:56.800]  was put on the plane by the State Department. And that's all admitted, C-SPAN congressional
[02:56.800 --> 03:02.080]  hearings and Amarillo-Laki, number three in Al-Qaeda, dining cigarette late at the Pentagon,
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.080]  Fox News.
[03:03.080 --> 03:09.040]  And they're just like a robot that can't compute. They're like, cannot compute, cannot compute,
[03:09.040 --> 03:18.480]  and smoke starts coming out of their ears. So we're gonna be discussing that as well.
[03:18.480 --> 03:24.680]  Also, this is in the Associated Press, New York Magazine, and the Wall Street Journal.
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.120]  MF Global's missing 1.2 billion, probably just vaporized. So the government knows where
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.280]  it was wired, most of it JP Morgan in London, that actually came out. But now everyone's
[03:34.280 --> 03:38.240]  gonna act like in the federal regulators, most of them that work for Khorasan and people
[03:38.240 --> 03:42.560]  like him on record, they're just gonna say, we don't know where the money went.
[03:42.560 --> 03:45.400]  And it doesn't matter if he got caught perjuring himself to Congress, that's just the way it
[03:45.400 --> 03:50.400]  is, we're breaking that down more. So money from MF Global feared gone after two, three
[03:50.400 --> 03:54.800]  months of stalling, two and a half months, saying, you're gonna get it, it'll take some
[03:54.800 --> 03:55.800]  time.
[03:55.800 --> 04:00.720]  I told you, you're not gonna get it. Cuz the globalists are setting a precedent here now
[04:00.720 --> 04:09.340]  where they just take your money and run. Now, remember last year, Arkansas, under federal
[04:09.340 --> 04:18.240]  pressure and chemical company lobbying, passed a law saying all water systems must be fluoridated.
[04:18.240 --> 04:24.200]  And now in states like Michigan, they're harassing even old homesteaders that have private wells
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.680]  saying, you've got to have it tested by the government every month to drink out of your
[04:27.680 --> 04:28.680]  own well.
[04:28.680 --> 04:35.280]  People just ignore the criminal mafia government. But now New Jersey has passed a law forcing
[04:35.280 --> 04:41.600]  fluoridation. So we're gonna be breaking down the arrogant forced medication by these globalist
[04:41.600 --> 04:47.000]  as well, the latest on Monsanto. By the way, I'm gonna be speaking in Dallas and Orlando,
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.760]  I haven't really even talked about this yet.
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.480]  And it's coming up in the month of February, I'll tell you about that. And billionaire
[04:52.480 --> 04:57.880]  club and bid to curve overpopulation. I wanna go back into this report. It's all coming
[04:57.880 --> 05:00.640]  up today.

[07:00.000 --> 07:04.480]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[07:04.480 --> 07:09.160]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[07:09.160 --> 07:13.160]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[07:13.160 --> 07:17.480]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again.
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.660]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[07:21.660 --> 07:27.960]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[07:27.960 --> 07:32.240]  food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[07:32.240 --> 07:37.620]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[07:37.620 --> 07:43.360]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[07:43.360 --> 07:54.960]  call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[07:54.960 --> 07:58.960]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[07:58.960 --> 08:06.960]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:06.960 --> 08:19.280]  Well, you saw the reports even in the dinosaur media this week. President Barack Hussein
[08:19.280 --> 08:29.040]  Obama refused to show up to a court to a subpoena and was ruled in contempt. But I mean, he
[08:29.040 --> 08:35.440]  launches wars without congressional approval and continues torture and secret arrest. And
[08:35.440 --> 08:39.160]  this is a science law saying he's a dictator or has dictatorial power.
[08:39.160 --> 08:46.880]  So why not ignore a court ruling? Remember Bill Clinton had to testify under a court
[08:46.880 --> 08:54.280]  ruling on sexual harassment, not election eligibility. And there's major evidence. The
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.880]  reason it went before the court is there's real evidence. I mean, we know he had someone
[08:58.880 --> 09:05.840]  else's social security number from Connecticut. That's confirmed. We know that the federal
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.320]  government ruled that his father wasn't really his father and kicked him out of the country
[09:10.320 --> 09:17.460]  saying it was a sham marriage. No kidding. If that guy is Obama's dad, I am a Easter
[09:17.460 --> 09:22.520]  Bunny jet pilot from the planet Uranus.
[09:22.520 --> 09:34.080]  It is just ridiculous. No, no resemblance, no genetic resemblance. It'd be like saying
[09:34.080 --> 09:41.080]  I look like, I don't know, Newt Gingrich. I look nothing like Newt Gingrich. They said
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.160]  Newt Gingrich is Alex Jones' dad. I mean, he said, well, he doesn't look anything like
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.400]  him. Well, it's the same thing with Obama, looks nothing like him.
[09:49.400 --> 09:56.920]  It'd be like saying, I don't know, the Queen of England's my mother. Actually, that'll
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.160]  start a new conspiracy theory. Actually, Bill Hicks is my mother. There's that conspiracy
[10:02.160 --> 10:09.760]  on the Internet that I am really Bill Hicks, yes. That's a good one.
[10:09.760 --> 10:15.960]  Okay, continuing here with serious news. We are broadcasting worldwide. It is the last
[10:15.960 --> 10:25.760]  day of January 2012. We will enter February. Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday edition.
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.560]  And we have got just off the chart news that I'm gonna try to contain myself with in a
[10:31.560 --> 10:33.200]  moment and not blow up.
[10:33.200 --> 10:40.120]  But let's just get into some of the main stories here today. From the political pile, we take
[10:40.120 --> 10:49.120]  you to Politico. CBO, Congressional Budget Office, reports another $1 trillion deficit.
[10:49.120 --> 10:58.560]  And now we're hearing about having to up the spending limits in Congress every few months
[10:58.560 --> 11:01.980]  instead of every few years.
[11:01.980 --> 11:06.040]  As the country gets deeper and deeper into debt to the banksters who get us into debt
[11:06.040 --> 11:10.640]  through fiat nothing since we went under the Federal Reserve System of 1913. And they have
[11:10.640 --> 11:17.840]  us signed on to their own debt as well. Now Obama's getting ready to really start campaigning
[11:17.840 --> 11:20.720]  officially and it looks like I've got some reports here.
[11:20.720 --> 11:27.960]  He's gonna go back to the good old tried and trued situation where he promises people free
[11:27.960 --> 11:34.340]  houses, free healthcare, free cars, free gas. Remember, all over the country, women mainly
[11:34.340 --> 11:38.620]  would say, Mr. President, I'm gonna get my free house and free car. Thank God, you're
[11:38.620 --> 11:39.620]  probably gonna get elected.
[11:39.620 --> 11:43.060]  Well, it looked like he was gonna win the polls. And then even after he got elected
[11:43.060 --> 11:46.760]  for a few months, they would say thank you for the free house. I know I'm gonna get it
[11:46.760 --> 11:54.980]  soon and he would go along with them. And so he's back on the campaign trail making
[11:54.980 --> 11:59.820]  similar statements. There's a video of that if we have time to get to it. It's up at infowars.com
[11:59.820 --> 12:02.640]  but it's from Real Clear Politics.
[12:02.640 --> 12:11.040]  Here's another one. Joe Biden advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Now, this is where
[12:11.040 --> 12:19.740]  they add kind of fictional background to make things look like it's real. Like, well, actually
[12:19.740 --> 12:24.280]  the original story isn't true. Ben Laden didn't get in a firefight for 30 minutes with the
[12:24.280 --> 12:35.620]  Navy SEALs or he didn't have bombs strapped to him or they just kind of changed the story
[12:35.620 --> 12:38.540]  over and over again.
[12:38.540 --> 12:44.140]  But still, by changing the story, it almost adds credence that it really happened and
[12:44.140 --> 12:49.120]  it's real in people's minds. Well, some of it's not true, but overall they did get bin
[12:49.120 --> 12:55.420]  Laden and they've been changing their story. They lied about the fact that the president
[12:55.420 --> 13:00.020]  was watching it live from that situation room and that that photo was staged.
[13:00.020 --> 13:05.100]  Well, that day I saw that the photo was staged. They're all staging and looking tough and
[13:05.100 --> 13:11.500]  you can see it's a staged photo. Hillary's got her hand up to her mouth, gasping at supposedly
[13:11.500 --> 13:18.660]  the kill shot. And the way he came out and announced it, you could see the PR propaganda
[13:18.660 --> 13:20.620]  roll out.
[13:20.620 --> 13:25.760]  Then the witnesses in Pakistan said they got on the plane, the helicopter, one of the stealth
[13:25.760 --> 13:33.600]  helicopters with somebody in traditional Pakistani dress and the helicopter blew up with everybody
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.060]  on board. And then I said, well, if that's true, we're gonna get some scuttlebutt and
[13:39.060 --> 13:44.380]  pretty soon we started getting some scuttlebutt that indeed some of SEAL Team 6 had been killed.
[13:44.380 --> 13:49.940]  But they started spinning it in the community and said, well, they died in some other actions.
[13:49.940 --> 13:55.940]  Then the helicopter with 23 of them sardined on board, which they never do, on a National
[13:55.940 --> 14:04.580]  Guard helicopter blows up a few months later. And then I talked to a Navy SEAL currently
[14:04.580 --> 14:09.700]  serving whose best buddy is in SEAL Team 6.
[14:09.700 --> 14:14.860]  And he says, well, most of them don't think like you do that it could have been the government
[14:14.860 --> 14:20.060]  but some of them do. But they do know that it was weird how they were put on the helicopter.
[14:20.060 --> 14:23.860]  They were reportedly complaining about it saying this is unusual. Where are we going?
[14:23.860 --> 14:28.740]  We're never put on these old helicopters. And you always split us up and why are we
[14:28.740 --> 14:31.500]  being put on with regular army people?
[14:31.500 --> 14:39.300]  And then inside the SEAL community, they think Al Qaeda got a bomb on board. Sure, so they
[14:39.300 --> 14:48.180]  know it blew up. And then they changed the story. The SEALs had been going to save people,
[14:48.180 --> 14:52.540]  save Rangers who were pinned down in a firefight on a rescue mission.
[14:52.540 --> 14:56.260]  And then they were sent to kill a nest of Al Qaeda and then they were just sent somewhere.
[14:56.260 --> 15:04.580]  And it turned out none of that was true. And so the SEALs, Lord bless them, know the helicopter
[15:04.580 --> 15:12.460]  was blown up. But they can't imagine that it was blown up by the bankers that run the
[15:12.460 --> 15:13.460]  military.
[15:13.460 --> 15:18.580]  Of course, you know what happened to Pat Tillman. He wrote letters home saying, they're growing
[15:18.580 --> 15:23.360]  the opium, this whole war is a fraud. I'm coming home to be anti-war. And the Pentagon
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.400]  said we're not gonna let our biggest recruiting tool turn against us. We'll have him charge
[15:27.400 --> 15:29.580]  an Al Qaeda machine gun nest single-handedly.
[15:29.580 --> 15:34.460]  We'll give him some Bronze Stars. Nobody will go against the hero story. It's kind of like
[15:34.460 --> 15:40.840]  let's roll. What do we do? The happy hooligans out of the Dakotas who were assigned to Virginia
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.220]  refused orders. Their own general refused orders, ordered the shoot down during the
[15:45.220 --> 15:47.340]  stand down and took down Flight 93.
[15:47.340 --> 15:52.260]  What do we do? Give them a let's roll story. Doesn't matter if the state police and everybody
[15:52.260 --> 15:58.220]  else saw the F-16s behind it, heard the explosion, miles and miles of debris field. We'll just
[15:58.220 --> 16:02.340]  show them one engine part where one engine went into the ground and call that the plane
[16:02.340 --> 16:08.620]  crash. We'll give them a hero story. They lapped that up. Let's roll.
[16:08.620 --> 16:15.740]  After all, Optimus Prime, Pentagon propaganda, pro-military movies and cartoons. Autobots,
[16:15.740 --> 16:26.020]  let's roll. Roll out. And a fake John Wayne voice. Autobots, roll out. Transform and roll
[16:26.020 --> 16:32.820]  out. It's the same thing. Pat Tillman charges the machine gun nest, fighting al-Qaeda.
[16:32.820 --> 16:41.940]  He was hit twice but still charged in, taking out an entire nest. He served America proudly
[16:41.940 --> 16:50.220]  until the army, was it a colonel, coroner? Said no, he was killed, homicide. He was shot
[16:50.220 --> 16:55.060]  with a three burst M-16 at close range, but not before he was shot at a distance first.
[16:55.060 --> 17:00.100]  And then it leaked out and was confirmed. He was up there. They got the team inserted.
[17:00.100 --> 17:04.260]  They start shooting him. He's only wounded with body armor. He's behind a rock, begging
[17:04.260 --> 17:08.660]  for help. Hey, I'm Pat Tillman, comes back up. I'm a ranger, I'm a ranger, shoot him
[17:08.660 --> 17:09.660]  again.
[17:09.660 --> 17:14.900]  He gets down, they get up, and they go, we know you're a ranger, pal. Shot him close
[17:14.900 --> 17:22.120]  enough to have powder burns. Three bursts right across the front of the forehead, or
[17:22.120 --> 17:32.580]  one burst, three rounds. Fighting al-Qaeda, charging the hill. Yes, then there's Private
[17:32.580 --> 17:33.580]  Lynch.
[17:33.580 --> 17:37.460]  See, that's why I can't ever cover all the news. Cuz I start mentioning one article and
[17:37.460 --> 17:42.860]  then I gotta prove the bin Laden raid's fake. Buried at sea, it's Muslim tradition, not
[17:42.860 --> 17:48.700]  Muslim law, not tradition, all lies. Then hundreds of people get disciplinary actions
[17:48.700 --> 17:53.460]  trumped up on the very ship that were involved in it. So they give them disorderly conducts
[17:53.460 --> 17:57.660]  cuz they were leaking that it was all fake.
[17:57.660 --> 18:04.980]  Private Lynch, coward in fear, as the men in the resupply convoy fought the Iraqi troops,
[18:04.980 --> 18:11.940]  the Republican Guard. Then she's in the hospital. Three days before, the Iraqis pull out, the
[18:11.940 --> 18:17.560]  Iraqi doctors go to the US, say she's here. They don't save her for three days. They get
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.740]  Jerry Bruckheimer, this is BBC, the Hollywood producer, one of the top guys in Hollywood,
[18:22.740 --> 18:30.980]  on record admits to consult by satellite on how to raid and act like they're fighting
[18:30.980 --> 18:33.140]  Republican Guard when they go in the hospital.
[18:33.140 --> 18:42.220]  Where's Jessica Lynch? Private Lynch hiding under the bed. Because it was all gonna be
[18:42.220 --> 18:49.620]  a big promotion rollout for women in the military. She's up there with a knife in her, a K-bar
[18:49.620 --> 18:56.860]  knife in her teeth. She's like Audie Murphy, just yeah, on top of that truck, just killing
[18:56.860 --> 19:00.620]  the Iraqis, she's really hiding in the back.
[19:00.620 --> 19:07.780]  Just all part of pure lies, pure fiction, pure garbage, just fed to you. And so you're
[19:07.780 --> 19:12.740]  not too smart, they jack your water with fluoride, sevenfold increase in cancer. Just search
[19:12.740 --> 19:18.060]  the term, fluoride cancer, sevenfold increase, brain damage, accelerates every other toxin
[19:18.060 --> 19:19.060]  in the body.
[19:19.060 --> 19:22.760]  Top scientists, surgeons, brain surgeons, all on to tell you. And guess what, all over
[19:22.760 --> 19:28.980]  the US, states are passing laws to make you have it in your water. And now they're announcing
[19:28.980 --> 19:34.500]  they're not gonna let you have well water. You haven't heard that, it's coming up. They're
[19:34.500 --> 19:39.380]  gonna come and put taxes and regulations. It doesn't matter if you got a 200-year-old
[19:39.380 --> 19:41.940]  thousand foot well into a crystal aquifer.
[19:41.940 --> 19:49.460]  You're gonna pay taxes and you're gonna have to get it tested monthly preemptively so that
[19:49.460 --> 19:53.940]  you're forced to drink the fluoride water so your kids have our brain damaged. That's
[19:53.940 --> 19:58.620]  all coming up. I haven't even gotten into the political stack yet. My gosh, you're gonna
[19:58.620 --> 20:00.180]  wanna stay with us.
[20:00.180 --> 20:04.860]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[20:04.860 --> 20:10.020]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[20:10.020 --> 20:13.500]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[20:13.500 --> 20:16.980]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[20:16.980 --> 20:21.540]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[20:21.540 --> 20:27.980]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[20:27.980 --> 20:32.340]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[20:32.340 --> 20:36.460]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[20:36.460 --> 20:43.820]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[20:43.820 --> 20:54.900]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[20:54.900 --> 21:00.620]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[24:13.980 --> 24:41.780]  Let's get one thing straight here. We have an incredible military of men and women who
[24:41.780 --> 24:46.900]  have joined by and large because they do wanna defend this republic and because they love
[24:46.900 --> 24:54.180]  this country. I've met them, I know them. On average, members of our military are per
[24:54.180 --> 24:58.180]  capita the best people in our society.
[24:58.180 --> 25:02.720]  And even though I bash police a lot when they do corrupt things because the system is trying
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.820]  to warp them and has done a pretty good job of doing that with the leadership, many of
[25:07.820 --> 25:14.700]  the best people in our society are police officers. When I was 15, 16, 17, not even
[25:14.700 --> 25:18.660]  so much naive. I knew that we had corrupt police when I was growing up in Dallas, thinking
[25:18.660 --> 25:19.660]  about careers.
[25:19.660 --> 25:23.840]  I wanted to be a forest ranger cuz I like being out in the outdoors. I was thinking
[25:23.840 --> 25:32.460]  about being a professor, a teacher, a cop. And my dad had a patient who at the time was
[25:32.460 --> 25:38.420]  the head federal marshal for this entire region. It was a multi-state region and my dad said,
[25:38.420 --> 25:42.940]  come in and meet this guy. And the guy was just about to retire and he called me and
[25:42.940 --> 25:44.260]  he goes, are you a criminal?
[25:44.260 --> 25:50.900]  And I said, no. And he goes, well, are you ready to do things that are pretty much kind
[25:50.900 --> 25:56.700]  of criminal? And I said, not really. And he goes, well then you might not wanna be a federal
[25:56.700 --> 26:01.780]  marshal. He goes, things have changed. And I was just like, and of course I wasn't even
[26:01.780 --> 26:02.980]  trying to be a federal marshal.
[26:02.980 --> 26:07.780]  I was just saying, I don't know what I'm gonna go to college for, dad. I guess I'll be a
[26:07.780 --> 26:16.540]  school teacher or maybe I'll get a degree in animal husbandry and be a vet. A veterinarian's
[26:16.540 --> 26:21.060]  that done work for a large animal vet and a small animal vet. At the time I was about
[26:21.060 --> 26:30.260]  13, I guess about 12 actually, and on the summers. And I'm already digressing. The point
[26:30.260 --> 26:33.640]  is, that was another wake up call right there.
[26:33.640 --> 26:39.460]  But we have a global elite trying to sell us on their values, on secret arrest, on no
[26:39.460 --> 26:45.760]  due process, on torture, and how good it is to not have any liberties. But you notice
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.540]  as we lose our liberties, it's like oxygen going out the door, out the window. As we
[26:52.540 --> 27:01.640]  lose our basic freedoms, our prosperity is disappearing. And of course, it's liberty
[27:01.640 --> 27:09.120]  that is the fertile soil and the sunshine and the water that allows human potential
[27:09.120 --> 27:12.580]  to sprout and to thrive.
[27:12.580 --> 27:18.940]  Freedom is what prosperity flows from. Every philosopher in history has realized this.
[27:18.940 --> 27:25.940]  Every historian knows this. But it's always criminal groups that don't care about prosperity.
[27:25.940 --> 27:32.140]  In fact, under feudalism, the elites hate prosperity because prosperity makes people
[27:32.140 --> 27:42.060]  uppity. Once you've gotten to a point in the hierarchy of needs, we don't know what that
[27:42.060 --> 27:43.060]  is, folks.
[27:43.060 --> 27:48.620]  It's a psychological world structure, a way to look at things. I think it's very accurate.
[27:48.620 --> 27:57.220]  In fact, guys, if you Google hierarchy of needs illustration or chart, it's a pyramid,
[27:57.220 --> 28:03.820]  that you first have to get food and shelter. Then you wanna become secure. Then you wanna
[28:03.820 --> 28:08.380]  find a mate and have a family and be accepted in your community.
[28:08.380 --> 28:13.500]  But after you've done all those things, the hierarchy of needs if you're healthy, you
[28:13.500 --> 28:18.400]  then start wanting to help others. Because you realize that you're part of a larger human
[28:18.400 --> 28:25.900]  system. And it's a basic instinct of people that have become successful, that once you
[28:25.900 --> 28:29.420]  get to that point, see, I've experienced things that most people never will.
[28:29.420 --> 28:36.500]  I've gotten to meet a lot of really famous people. I've gotten to see a lot of things
[28:36.500 --> 28:41.980]  that other people will never see. And I was a little starstruck 10 years ago and things
[28:41.980 --> 28:45.980]  when I would get a chance to meet really famous people. I was even somewhat starstruck three
[28:45.980 --> 28:51.540]  or four years ago. I've just now in the last few years gotten to the point where it's interesting
[28:51.540 --> 28:57.580]  to know famous people because a lot of times they're very interesting artists or researchers
[28:57.580 --> 28:58.580]  and they're neat.
[28:58.580 --> 29:10.200]  There's a reason they're famous. They have something special about them. But now it is
[29:10.200 --> 29:19.620]  so satisfying to know that hype and fame and peer pressure mean nothing. Nothing. It is
[29:19.620 --> 29:28.940]  such the most valuable thing I have after my family and my fact that I have basic honor
[29:28.940 --> 29:38.260]  is that I could care less what people think about me.
[29:38.260 --> 29:43.180]  And of course, there's a nuance to that. I care what good people think about me. Or if
[29:43.180 --> 29:47.300]  I think I've done something that's wrong, I then want to make it right. But I don't
[29:47.300 --> 29:50.180]  care what scum thinks.
[29:50.180 --> 30:01.700]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.700 --> 30:05.980]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[30:05.980 --> 30:10.580]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[30:10.580 --> 30:14.420]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[30:14.420 --> 30:17.100]  anywhere in or on the body.
[30:17.100 --> 30:22.220]  My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator. Not only does
[30:22.220 --> 30:26.980]  the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes
[30:26.980 --> 30:32.220]  equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly
[30:32.220 --> 30:40.180]  to key target areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and
[30:40.180 --> 30:42.500]  orally for the digestive system.
[30:42.500 --> 30:49.820]  Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com

[33:20.020 --> 33:25.700]  have found it, the tip of the spear, the front lines of the info war.
[33:25.700 --> 33:30.580]  Dr. Jerome, of course, he's going to be with us about 30, 40 minutes of the second hour
[33:30.580 --> 33:39.260]  then I'll cover more news. We'll also open the phones up on the Obama situation in court
[33:39.260 --> 33:44.140]  where he has been found in contempt. Bill Clinton showed up for his court hearings,
[33:44.140 --> 33:49.140]  not Lord Obama. Of course, Karl Rove didn't show up for court hearings, he just left the
[33:49.140 --> 33:53.420]  United States for a while back when he was being subpoenaed to courts and being ordered
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.420]  to appear.
[33:54.420 --> 33:59.940]  So it's just all part of the lawlessness that we see intensifying. Okay, I was starting
[33:59.940 --> 34:06.060]  to get into the news. I wanna get into forced fluoridation here in a moment, forced inoculation.
[34:06.060 --> 34:11.140]  Huge developments on that front, some big Monsanto news, huge financial news in Europe
[34:11.140 --> 34:16.060]  with a EU dictatorship and their own words being set up over the once sovereign nations
[34:16.060 --> 34:19.540]  to raise taxes to pay the bankers for their derivatives fraud.
[34:19.540 --> 34:24.220]  I mean, if this is the case, they should get Bernie Madoff out of jail, making president
[34:24.220 --> 34:32.140]  of the world and have him set global economic policy. But see, he's low level compared to
[34:32.140 --> 34:45.020]  them. Bernie Madoff is a low level person that made the mistake of robbing some rich
[34:45.020 --> 34:50.820]  people on the inside and that's why they're going down.
[34:50.820 --> 34:56.220]  Corzine did the right thing according to the New World Order mafia, top White House financial
[34:56.220 --> 35:04.380]  advisor, a former New Jersey governor. We're now two and a half months into this and he
[35:04.380 --> 35:08.300]  went before Congress a month ago and the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said no.
[35:08.300 --> 35:14.400]  I was on the phone when they did this with his chief executive officers. They told me
[35:14.400 --> 35:21.620]  when I said, why are you doing this? We've been given the order by John Corzine.
[35:21.620 --> 35:29.540]  Terrence Duffy went in front of Congress under oath and a prepared statement was put out
[35:29.540 --> 35:36.580]  by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange saying that Corzine didn't know and that Duffy didn't
[35:36.580 --> 35:41.640]  know. But when Duffy actually got in testimony, he starts reading the statement and then changes
[35:41.640 --> 35:45.740]  it and looks up and says I was on the phone with him and he gave the order.
[35:45.740 --> 35:51.340]  Cuz see, Duffy's thinking if this comes down, if this falls apart, I didn't commit the crime
[35:51.340 --> 35:59.780]  here. I knew they did it, but now if I lie when there's all these witnesses, but of course,
[35:59.780 --> 36:03.620]  there's the Congress. They're involved in insider trading and get caught and tell the
[36:03.620 --> 36:05.460]  public they're allowed to, which they're not.
[36:05.460 --> 36:09.820]  It's like you catch somebody murdering somebody and they go, well, I'm allowed to murder.
[36:09.820 --> 36:13.340]  No, you're not. Well, I'm allowed to launch wars without congressional approval. No, you're
[36:13.340 --> 36:17.420]  not. Well, I'm allowed to order torture cuz I'm the president. Remember Bush's book last
[36:17.420 --> 36:18.420]  year came out?
[36:18.420 --> 36:23.740]  He said, well, I can order torture cuz I'm the president. Really, can you go pick up
[36:23.740 --> 36:29.580]  a prostitute in downtown DC and go behind a building and blow our brains out or maybe
[36:29.580 --> 36:35.700]  knock our teeth out? No, you can't. You're not above the law. Hitler wasn't, Stalin wasn't,
[36:35.700 --> 36:41.340]  Obama isn't, Karl Rove isn't, Newt Gingrich isn't, Mitt Romney isn't.
[36:41.340 --> 36:47.580]  I'm not above the law. You're not above the law. Nobody's above the law. And when governments
[36:47.580 --> 36:51.940]  start telling you they're above the law, look out, Hitler did that. It was called the Hitler
[36:51.940 --> 37:00.060]  precept. Or the Nuremberg called the Hitler precept after his name. It was called the
[37:00.060 --> 37:10.480]  FÃ¼hrer precept by the Germans, or the Lieder precept, ein Wolk ein Reich ein FÃ¼hrer.
[37:10.480 --> 37:16.780]  One people, one land, one leader. Ein Wolk ein Reich ein FÃ¼hrer. And presidents come
[37:16.780 --> 37:22.140]  and go. Obama is now, for all his purposes, behaving like a dictator and sees many powers
[37:22.140 --> 37:23.140]  of a dictator.
[37:23.140 --> 37:28.460]  But it doesn't mean he himself is a dictator. That office, controlled by the globalist and
[37:28.460 --> 37:32.900]  special interest, has now become one. And that's why the system is torpedoing Newt Gingrich
[37:32.900 --> 37:40.540]  right now. Mitt Romney has the same pedigree politically, is a total globalist, would vote
[37:40.540 --> 37:43.460]  exactly like Newt Gingrich.
[37:43.460 --> 37:49.780]  The difference is, Mitt Romney is a corporate shill and knows to follow orders 100% and
[37:49.780 --> 37:58.500]  has proven it. Newt Gingrich has a man with big ideas. Newt Gingrich is a leader in a
[37:58.500 --> 38:04.320]  bad way. Newt Gingrich is a man on fire. Newt Gingrich would tell people when he was a kid
[38:04.320 --> 38:06.060]  he was gonna be president.
[38:06.060 --> 38:11.540]  Newt Gingrich will lie like you've never seen, and he wants power for himself and hates other
[38:11.540 --> 38:16.060]  people around him and those above him. And the elite do not want Newt Gingrich in there
[38:16.060 --> 38:21.620]  because he'd actually try to be a president like Richard Nixon, who was bad in a lot of
[38:21.620 --> 38:23.860]  ways, but actually tried to be president.
[38:23.860 --> 38:28.900]  And that's why they're destroying Newt Gingrich. And again, I'm scared of Newt Gingrich. I
[38:28.900 --> 38:35.220]  fully understand, and by scared, I mean he's dangerous. I know he's super dangerous. Same
[38:35.220 --> 38:39.460]  way I'm scared of a truck going on the highway 100 miles an hour. I know to get out of the
[38:39.460 --> 38:42.080]  way of it.
[38:42.080 --> 38:47.880]  And so the issue is the establishment is concerned about him as well, cuz he's the type that
[38:47.880 --> 38:54.620]  would try to actually double-cross the globalist. Mittens, Romney, not so much. I mean, look,
[38:54.620 --> 38:59.780]  the last head of Bain Capital's just gone to be a replace the mob boss daily that they
[38:59.780 --> 39:04.500]  had in there from the Chicago crew in the Obama White House.
[39:04.500 --> 39:13.260]  So I mean, it's one happy, disgusting pea pod with these folks. And Ron Paul is turbo
[39:13.260 --> 39:23.860]  charging, obviously, and is really in second place. And after Newt Gingrich is destroyed,
[39:23.860 --> 39:27.240]  who's left? Ron Paul, they've already tried to destroy him. And he's gonna end up getting
[39:27.240 --> 39:34.100]  more delegates in Maine than he would have gotten in Florida, which is winner take all.
[39:34.100 --> 39:39.860]  That's why he's not focusing on Florida. Loves Florida, cares about Florida, but he also
[39:39.860 --> 39:44.420]  knows the fix is in down there. I mean, you guys are as famous as Illinois. And I'm not
[39:44.420 --> 39:46.980]  knocking Florida, beautiful great state.
[39:46.980 --> 39:54.980]  LBJ was fixing elections in Congress in the 40s here in Texas. So we're bad too. It's
[39:54.980 --> 40:00.640]  just Florida has been caught over and over again, like Ohio and Illinois. I mean, it's
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.300]  been proven to have so much fraud. It'll make your head spin on elections for a long time
[40:05.300 --> 40:11.940]  that Florida takes second place in election fraud after Illinois.
[40:11.940 --> 40:18.300]  But here it is, MF Global's missing 1.2 billion, probably just vaporized. And the feds know
[40:18.300 --> 40:24.140]  it was wired to JP Morgan. They know, it was in the news at the time that, yeah, it was
[40:24.140 --> 40:28.780]  sent over to JP Morgan, but we're gonna get some of that back. And then now the media,
[40:28.780 --> 40:31.100]  the Congress, everyone plays dumb.
[40:31.100 --> 40:36.740]  When you wire $1,000, the feds know where it goes, it's all tracked. When you wire $10,000,
[40:36.740 --> 40:44.100]  a criminal investigation report is filed. When you deposit that, it is reviewed, suspicious
[40:44.100 --> 40:53.140]  transaction. But you're gonna believe that 1.2 billion is wired to England, the lion's
[40:53.140 --> 41:00.060]  share of it to the division of JP Morgan Chase. This came out in Forbes, AP Bloomberg.
[41:00.060 --> 41:05.740]  This came out two days after it broke. And then now everyone's acting stupid. We don't
[41:05.740 --> 41:11.620]  know where the money went. We don't know where. We found it, you're gonna get it back, just
[41:11.620 --> 41:15.660]  don't sue us. Just wait, just let us have the congressional hearings. Corazon gets up
[41:15.660 --> 41:19.100]  and says, I know nothing as CEO, I have no idea.
[41:19.100 --> 41:23.660]  And the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that goes, I'm not going along with this.
[41:23.660 --> 41:27.340]  He was there, he gave the orders. We were concerned about it, we're on the phone when
[41:27.340 --> 41:32.180]  the decision was made, on this date. And you see all the lawyers around him going, looking
[41:32.180 --> 41:35.940]  at him like, a hit team's coming for you, pal.
[41:35.940 --> 41:45.500]  I mean, the point is, is this is getting really chutzpah, naked, bravado filled. They're getting
[41:45.500 --> 41:50.580]  really wild. I mean, this lunatic Corzine was making 40 to 1 bets with other people's
[41:50.580 --> 41:54.680]  money. And according to Max Keiser, who's got incredible sources, he called Iceland
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.020]  two years before it happened.
[41:58.020 --> 42:02.420]  He runs in these circles, worked for many years with George Soros' son. He said he talked
[42:02.420 --> 42:09.580]  to the sources and they said that the head of JP Morgan called up Corzine and said, look,
[42:09.580 --> 42:15.180]  you're dead if you don't give us that money. That's how these guys in the past have worked.
[42:15.180 --> 42:19.220]  These are gangsters, they run the country, they run the military, they run it all. They're
[42:19.220 --> 42:22.340]  like, look, you gave us our money or it's over.
[42:22.340 --> 42:25.860]  So he went and took people's private bank accounts. And now, New York Magazine, all
[42:25.860 --> 42:35.620]  of them are like, nobody knows, just forget it, you're not getting it. Cuz Papa JP Morgan
[42:35.620 --> 42:40.020]  and Goldman Sachs is reportedly involved in there as well. The bankrupt brokerage firm
[42:40.020 --> 42:45.260]  MF Global still can't account for some 1.2 billion in customer funds. But an ongoing
[42:45.260 --> 42:51.440]  investigation imagines that a significant amount of the money vaporized during the company's
[42:51.440 --> 42:52.820]  crashing and burning.
[42:52.820 --> 42:59.460]  It just went into the end of the rainbow, there's a golden pot somewhere. If you know
[42:59.460 --> 43:04.820]  the Leprechaun password, he'll give it to you. Here's another one, money from MF Global
[43:04.820 --> 43:13.940]  feared gone, Wall Street Journal. This is the naked, lawless, out of control garbage
[43:13.940 --> 43:19.460]  that we're dealing with. And these crook bankers are shutting down all the small banks with
[43:19.460 --> 43:24.460]  the regulators they control, taking over our economy, getting tax incentives to move offshore,
[43:24.460 --> 43:31.100]  getting bailout money to move businesses and factories overseas, everything.
[43:31.100 --> 43:37.640]  And what's the only growth area? FBI, federal marshals, police, TSA, armies of intelligence
[43:37.640 --> 43:49.580]  agents spies to go after the American people. They are arming up against us. Now I wanna
[43:49.580 --> 43:58.240]  go to a special report we've got here. And then we're gonna come back from break and
[43:58.240 --> 44:01.080]  get into sodium fluoride.
[44:01.080 --> 44:06.420]  But you know last March, the legislature in Arkansas passed a law saying cities are passing
[44:06.420 --> 44:11.360]  laws when they see the medical evidence, the fluoride gives you cancer and brain damage.
[44:11.360 --> 44:17.540]  We're just gonna pass a law that you've got to take. Fluoride, we're gonna put it in your
[44:17.540 --> 44:24.860]  water by law. Now New Jersey has passed a law doing this. New Jersey Assembly panel
[44:24.860 --> 44:28.380]  won't pass this bill to add fluoride to public supply.
[44:28.380 --> 44:31.860]  And now they've got reports out of Michigan that they're going and other states they're
[44:31.860 --> 44:37.380]  gonna shut down and not let you use your own well. I mean, folks, these are control freaks.
[44:37.380 --> 44:41.260]  Going after the Amish, going after the Girl Scout cookies, going after the lemonade stands
[44:41.260 --> 44:46.660]  all over the country, going after tomato sellers, pecan sellers, people selling jam.
[44:46.660 --> 44:53.140]  The mafia says, you don't do jack without our approval and paying us a cut. You go to
[44:53.140 --> 44:57.100]  a big box store and get something made in China with melamine in it for your kids. FDA
[44:57.100 --> 45:02.820]  says it's good for them. Radiation levels have gone up, they had another reactor.
[45:02.820 --> 45:06.140]  The APs reporting release more radiation, not even an issue. We raise the level, we
[45:06.140 --> 45:10.740]  say it's safe. Cuz the mafia says it's safe and we're taking your bank account. In fact,
[45:10.740 --> 45:14.700]  I saw an article last week, I didn't even cover it. Government raids federal pension
[45:14.700 --> 45:19.560]  funds. I even forgot, print that, type type, I forgot that. It's coming in so fast, I can't
[45:19.560 --> 45:24.840]  even cover it anymore. Do you understand this?
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.940]  They are going for broke, stealing everything. All you cops, FBI, the rest of you, when they're
[45:29.940 --> 45:33.520]  done you're gonna have nothing as well, remember that. But you'll still have your little authority
[45:33.520 --> 45:39.940]  in your power trip. Now here's a part of the report, we're gonna hear an expanded version
[45:39.940 --> 45:47.700]  with Darren McBreen with us live in studio tonight, 7 o'clock central at prisonplanet.tv.
[45:47.700 --> 45:55.360]  This is Darren McBreen, our reporter, out talking to local Austinites about aspartame,
[45:55.360 --> 46:02.480]  the defecation of a bio weapons bacteria produced by the Pentagon in 1963. But they finally
[46:02.480 --> 46:10.180]  got approval after three rounds in 1979 with Monsanto when they bought Serol.
[46:10.180 --> 46:15.820]  And it is an addictive excitotoxin that causes brain damage, pancreatic cancer, you name
[46:15.820 --> 46:21.160]  it. It breaks down into formaldehyde in the bloodstream, but it's very addictive. Most
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.920]  poisons are addictive, arsenic's addictive. And so here's his report, we're gonna have
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.040]  an expanded part two, and Darren in studio with us this evening.
[46:31.040 --> 46:36.280]  Here is that report, and then we're gonna skip this network break. We're gonna continue
[46:36.280 --> 46:41.960]  with the forced fluoridation. And again, the forced inoculation laws now finally going
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.040]  into place. They always ran the hoax, it was the law. Now that people are standing up,
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.600]  taking their cities back, the globalists are like, no, no, no, no, no, you're gonna drink
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.260]  our toxic waste.
[46:53.260 --> 46:56.640]  Here's the report on aspartame.
[46:56.640 --> 47:01.880]  Thousands of popular diet and sugar-free foods and beverages contain an artificial sweetener
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.840]  that researchers say may cause cancer. The ingredient is aspartame, and it is by far
[47:07.840 --> 47:13.680]  the most dangerous substance on the market that is added to our foods. Aspartame is an
[47:13.680 --> 47:19.680]  artificial sweetener found in thousands of products worldwide, and chances are you are
[47:19.680 --> 47:25.160]  consuming it. It's added to sugar-free gum, juice beverages, tabletop sweeteners like
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.920]  Equal and NutraSweet. It's in cereals, soft drinks, yogurt, breath mints, multivitamins,
[47:30.920 --> 47:36.920]  wine coolers, and even over-the-counter medicines. The toxic long-term effects of aspartame are
[47:36.920 --> 47:42.640]  often dismissed as a hoax by the sweetener industry. However, numerous independent controlled
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.280]  studies using human subjects have concluded that aspartame is deadly.
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.360]  Now there's a number of studies that claim that aspartame is completely safe to consume,
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.200]  but the vast majority of those studies were conducted by, well, you guessed it, the aspartame
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.640]  industry. In fact, groups like Monsanto, J.D. Searle, and ILSI concluded that aspartame
[48:04.640 --> 48:10.440]  pose no health risk, but that's about as credible as Marlboro, Camel, and Winston dismissing
[48:10.440 --> 48:19.440]  the link between cigarette smoking and cancer.
[48:19.440 --> 48:20.440]  Have you heard of aspartame?
[48:20.440 --> 48:21.880]  Yes, I've heard of it before.
[48:21.880 --> 48:23.640]  Have you heard good things or bad things?
[48:23.640 --> 48:25.400]  I hear mostly bad things about it.
[48:25.400 --> 48:26.840]  What kind of bad things?
[48:26.840 --> 48:30.000]  Just like it's an artificial sweetener and it's bad for your health and you should try
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  to stay away.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.760]  I've heard it's an artificial sweetener and I'm guilty of drinking beverages sweetened
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.400]  with it. However, it degenerates and it does harmful things.
[48:39.400 --> 48:41.220]  What do you think about aspartame?
[48:41.220 --> 48:43.400]  I don't like it. It gives me headaches.
[48:43.400 --> 48:48.320]  They did studies on rats. It supposedly causes cancer.
[48:48.320 --> 48:54.400]  Even Fox News recently reported in 2005 that artificial sweeteners had been linked to a
[48:54.400 --> 49:00.520]  wide range of cancers after studying involving rats. So these rats actually had tumors the
[49:00.520 --> 49:04.160]  size of golf balls. So does that concern you when you hear stuff like that?
[49:04.160 --> 49:08.020]  Greatly, yes. And the FDA is supposed to be protecting us from things like cancer, not
[49:08.020 --> 49:10.720]  giving it to us and telling us it's safe.
[49:10.720 --> 49:16.000]  You cannot go to the grocery store now and buy any type of even regular sugar gum that
[49:16.000 --> 49:23.100]  hasn't had aspartame added to it. In the 1970s, Searle tried to get it approved and they couldn't.
[49:23.100 --> 49:27.620]  It took them three separate times because in their own studies with monkeys, large portions
[49:27.620 --> 49:33.400]  of them that were fed it died and contracted cancer. Now we have mainstream news articles
[49:33.400 --> 49:39.600]  and the EU has done a major study finding lower birth weights, early birth and yes,
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.000]  miscarriages from women that drink aspartame laden soft drinks like Coke Zero.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  Do you think that aspartame should be on the market today?
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  No.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  Why not?
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  Because it hasn't been demonstrated to be safe.
[49:55.000 --> 50:01.200]  The FDA looked at the research and in 1975 put aspartame's approval on hold. It set up
[50:01.200 --> 50:07.400]  an independent panel of doctors to study aspartame. In 1980, that public court of inquiry unanimously
[50:07.400 --> 50:10.400]  ruled aspartame should not go on the market.
[50:10.400 --> 50:15.400]  Edith was drinking a cup of low calorie hot chocolate that night. Aspartame made it sweet.
[50:15.400 --> 50:18.400]  And Johnson says aspartame made her sick.
[50:18.400 --> 50:23.800]  All of a sudden I couldn't see and my eyes went out of purpose and my vision became quite
[50:23.800 --> 50:24.800]  blurred.
[50:24.800 --> 50:25.800]  Do you think it's because of aspartame?
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.800]  I think it's very deliberately because of aspartame, yes.
[50:28.800 --> 50:30.800]  It was terrifying.
[50:30.800 --> 50:32.800]  Kate Randall thought she was going crazy.
[50:32.800 --> 50:38.800]  I started popping in my hands and twitching in my feet, my legs, my knees, my upper legs
[50:38.800 --> 50:40.800]  and shoulders and arms and everywhere.
[50:40.800 --> 50:49.800]  Many of these individuals that have been aspartame reactors have tested themselves 5, 10, 20
[50:49.800 --> 50:55.800]  times every time getting the same response and then they realized that this was a legitimate
[50:55.800 --> 50:57.800]  cause and effect relationship.
[50:57.800 --> 51:03.800]  What is aspartame? It is the fecal matter of the E. coli bacteria. They took it and genetically
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.800]  engineered it. They could feed it toxic waste and then it defecates aspartame. And it has
[51:08.800 --> 51:11.800]  so many bad health effects, it's just unspeakable.
[51:11.800 --> 51:16.800]  How do you think a product like that was managed to be approved by the FDA?
[51:16.800 --> 51:18.800]  Oh, I think there's loopholes to everything.
[51:18.800 --> 51:24.800]  I say shut the FDA down, shut down any government agency that's not doing its job.
[51:24.800 --> 51:27.800]  Would you think that possibly the FDA is corrupt?
[51:27.800 --> 51:32.800]  I'm going to go ahead and say no. I trust the FDA with my health.
[51:32.800 --> 51:36.800]  Do you think there's a chance the FDA could be corrupt?
[51:36.800 --> 51:41.800]  About as big a chance as any other part of our government.
[51:41.800 --> 51:47.800]  Now the FDA approval of aspartame was highly contested and subject to multiple congressional
[51:47.800 --> 51:53.800]  hearings and scientific criticism. In fact, aspartame was continuously rejected by the
[51:53.800 --> 51:58.800]  FDA for over 15 years until it was finally approved in 1981.
[51:58.800 --> 52:04.800]  Since that time, the FDA has published a list of 92 symptoms of aspartame poisoning, which
[52:04.800 --> 52:09.800]  includes headaches, vision loss, including blindness, seizures, neurological problems,
[52:09.800 --> 52:16.800]  cardiovascular problems, and death. The FDA even admits adverse reactions to aspartame
[52:16.800 --> 52:21.800]  that comprise about 80% of consumer complaints it reaches each year.
[52:21.800 --> 52:26.800]  Yet the dangerous substance remains on the market and is consumed by millions of people
[52:26.800 --> 52:31.800]  every single day. I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[52:31.800 --> 52:37.800]  All right, great job from Darren on that front. We're going to get into fluoride,
[52:37.800 --> 52:42.800]  being forcibly out of the water here in a moment, but just expanding on this.
[52:42.800 --> 52:50.800]  You notice the last five, six, seven years, something big has happened. All of these companies
[52:50.800 --> 52:56.800]  have come out with stevia or other artificial sweeteners, and they advertise, and most people
[52:56.800 --> 52:58.800]  now try to bypass aspartame.
[52:58.800 --> 53:04.800]  So what did the aspartame makers do? They proliferated. It is in most sugar candy. Read
[53:04.800 --> 53:11.800]  the back. It is in chocolate bars. It is in almost every form of sugar gum. I know I've
[53:11.800 --> 53:17.800]  got children. I go to the grocery store. You cannot find it without it. It's in most of
[53:17.800 --> 53:22.800]  the over-the-counter medication you take, just spiked into pills you're supposed to
[53:22.800 --> 53:24.800]  just swallow anyways.
[53:24.800 --> 53:35.800]  It is in all sorts of different foods, tens of thousands. And it is addictive. It is a
[53:35.800 --> 53:41.800]  neurotoxin. And I talked to so many people, young and old, who are going, yeah, I got
[53:41.800 --> 53:45.800]  macular degeneration. I'm losing my sight. They won't tell me why.
[53:45.800 --> 53:52.800]  And it's well known in the studies that it made the monkeys go blind. And what do you
[53:52.800 --> 53:57.800]  think what alcohol does? What do you think old moonshine that it made right and gets
[53:57.800 --> 54:05.800]  put alcohol and it does? It makes you go blind. It's grain alcohol. It's what you want to
[54:05.800 --> 54:07.800]  be drinking if you're gonna do that.
[54:07.800 --> 54:12.800]  It breaks down in, just look it up for yourself. And I know most of you know this, but it just
[54:12.800 --> 54:17.800]  illustrates how out of control the system is. Now look at this article. And I've got
[54:17.800 --> 54:21.800]  a couple of these. New Jersey assembly panel passes bill to add fluoride to public water.
[54:21.800 --> 54:26.800]  I did a video on this last night. It's up at infowars.com. Water companies in New Jersey
[54:26.800 --> 54:30.800]  would be required to add fluoride to the water supply under a bill approved Monday by an
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.800]  assembly panel at the urging of dentists and public health professionals, despite objectives
[54:36.800 --> 54:39.800]  from environmentalists and utility officials.
[54:39.800 --> 54:45.800]  They don't tell you here that the majority of the EPA's and FDA scientists have gone
[54:45.800 --> 54:51.800]  public to Congress. Thousands of them signing letters saying it gives you cancer, that it
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.800]  causes brain damage. They just act like urging from the dentist. You mean the American Dental
[54:55.800 --> 54:59.800]  Association who's been forced to tell people under five not to brush with it?
[54:59.800 --> 55:05.800]  It says on the back it's poison. It actually causes a dental florosis and dental problems.
[55:05.800 --> 55:10.800]  And it's not just sodium fluoride they're adding. It's toxic waste, hundreds of chemicals
[55:10.800 --> 55:16.800]  they call fluoride. But regardless, let's say it's the best things in sliced bread.
[55:16.800 --> 55:21.800]  The government's gonna force Medicaid us and counties and cities pass laws saying get it
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.800]  out before it was just lobbyists paying them to do it. And they say, we're gonna pass state
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.800]  law and make you do it. And then I saw an article, I've gotta hear my stack out, we're
[55:30.800 --> 55:31.800]  all over the country.
[55:31.800 --> 55:35.800]  Michigan was the first article I saw. They're coming in and saying we've gotta certify your
[55:35.800 --> 55:41.800]  well is safe. Gotta sit in for testing every month to us. Why don't you just get on fluoridation?
[55:41.800 --> 55:46.800]  We're gonna tax you to use your own well water as well. Here's one in Arkansas, state passes
[55:46.800 --> 55:51.800]  fluoridation law, a coalition created. And it goes on to say a statewide fluoridation
[55:51.800 --> 55:55.800]  measure and two other bills and improving oral health in Arkansas were passed and signed
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.800]  into law.
[55:58.800 --> 56:05.800]  Pushed by the State Dental Association, who's paid off by the big chemical makers. And just
[56:05.800 --> 56:13.800]  type in fluoride bone cancer, fluoride brain damage, fluoride pineal gland, thyroid malfunction.
[56:13.800 --> 56:17.800]  You wonder why women all got their hair falling out, why women almost, now it's upward in
[56:17.800 --> 56:22.800]  some areas half the women. On average over 30% have thyroid problems, just killing our
[56:22.800 --> 56:24.800]  women especially.
[56:24.800 --> 56:31.800]  And they just get away with it. They just get away with all of it. They think it's funny.
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.800]  And now in California, they're saying we're gonna inoculate your kids without authorization.
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.800]  Okay, I wanna make some announcements before we go to break and come back with Dr. Jerome
[56:40.800 --> 56:45.800]  Corsi. And then Alan Watt always informed was gonna be joining us to look at the overall
[56:45.800 --> 56:47.800]  system of the New World Order.
[56:47.800 --> 56:53.800]  I'm gonna be speaking at two different events, the Lakeway Theater, the 19th of February.
[56:53.800 --> 56:58.800]  It's a Sunday in Dallas, Texas, and only holds about 900 people. It sold out six years ago
[56:58.800 --> 57:03.800]  when I was there. So get your tickets at infoawards.com forward slash events and links through the
[57:03.800 --> 57:05.800]  Lakeway theaters where you get them.
[57:05.800 --> 57:09.800]  For 25 bucks, that includes all the event fees and taxes and garbage. We're really charged
[57:09.800 --> 57:14.800]  in about 18 bucks when it gets to the end of it. You know, the Segal impact's 500 bucks
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.800]  and I know I could get people to pay that, but I don't wanna fly around on private jets.
[57:18.800 --> 57:21.800]  It's 25 bucks.
[57:21.800 --> 57:28.800]  And again, we're also gonna be in Florida on the 26th in Orlando where we're number
[57:28.800 --> 57:32.800]  one on the radio on 810 AM, the big 810 AM. They're putting on, I'll do my radio show
[57:32.800 --> 57:36.800]  live there as the doors open at five o'clock, then it's seven Eastern.
[57:36.800 --> 57:39.800]  When the show's over, I'll get up and give an hour and a half speech called Blueprint
[57:39.800 --> 57:43.800]  to defeat the new world order that I'm working on. And I'm working on a mini documentary
[57:43.800 --> 57:46.800]  that complements that about 30 minutes long that'll premiere at both.
[57:46.800 --> 57:52.800]  Get tickets at infoawardsteam.com. And of course, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex station,
[57:52.800 --> 57:58.800]  a great station is KKGM 1630 Blowtorch that carries us live during the day. We're on there
[57:58.800 --> 58:03.800]  right now as well. They're sponsoring it as well, so it's in association with all those
[58:03.800 --> 58:08.800]  folks. Find out more at infoawards.com forward slash.
[58:08.800 --> 58:12.800]  And today is the last day. Thank you, John, for reminding me. I told him to remind me
[58:12.800 --> 58:17.800]  yesterday. It's the last day for the early bird special we've done in December and then
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.800]  in January. 44% off on a yearly membership. You pay for 6.7 months, you get 5.3 months

[58:33.800 --> 58:37.800]  had prisonplanet.tv and we have a 15-day free trial as well. We'll be right back.
[58:42.800 --> 58:46.800]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:49.800 --> 58:54.800]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[58:54.800 --> 58:59.800]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[58:59.800 --> 59:04.800]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as
[59:04.800 --> 59:09.800]  one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence
[59:09.800 --> 59:15.800]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes
[59:15.800 --> 59:20.800]  how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[59:20.800 --> 59:25.800]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[59:25.800 --> 59:30.800]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[59:30.800 --> 59:35.800]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[59:35.800 --> 59:41.800]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure
[59:41.800 --> 59:50.800]  your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.800]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:46.800]  All right, we are now into hour number two. Dr. Jerome Corsi is gonna be joining us. Coming
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:55.800]  up in the next segment, where there's smoke, there's fire. And as you know, it has now
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.800]  come out that Obama is in contempt of court. Obama's lawyers outline subpoena defense for
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800]  court appearance.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.800]  That came out last week, but then they didn't show up. Obama accused of contempt of court
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.800]  in birther hearing. Secretary of State warns Obama, miss hearing at your own peril, and
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.800]  he did miss it. We're gonna be talking about that and then anti-globalist researcher Alan
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.800]  Watt is gonna be joining us as well.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.800]  And I will open the phones up for Dr. Corsi for your questions, specifically surrounding
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.800]  the birth certificate. You agree with him, you disagree, you've got questions. He's a
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.800]  very credible researcher. And all I can say is, you look at the fact that even the federal
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.800]  government threw his dad out of the country and said, looks like it's a sham marriage.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.800]  His dad looks nothing like him. But George W Bush, it turns out quietly during the election,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.800]  sent letters to the Kenyan government.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.800]  They went and looked for his birth records and said that they'd been removed. Why would
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.800]  there even be birth records there if he wasn't born there? And his grandma says he was born
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.800]  there. And then really the coup de grace that I'll repeat when we come back from break,
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.800]  as some stations don't carry this segment. The creme dala creme, the final blow, is the
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.800]  fact that he used somebody else's social security number.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:13.800]  The question is, who gave him that? Well, the fact is, his whole family was CIA. He
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.800]  was given a Connecticut social security number and allowed to use it and didn't get in trouble
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.800]  when it was pointed out. So this is really starting to come to a head. We're gonna be
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800]  discussing that with Dr. Corsi.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.800]  Now, I don't feel like I got angry enough. Last night when Aaron Dykes walked in here
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:39.800]  at about 6 o'clock and said, have you seen that New Jersey passed a law that you're forcibly
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.800]  fluoridated? I just shot a video right there on my iPhone and uploaded it, I was so mad.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.800]  And then today, again, it's almost like I've just been conditioned to accept their criminality.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.800]  All over the United States, they're strong arming, the feds are coming in with money,
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.800]  companies are coming in, buying off politicians, getting involved in local elections, or having
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:06.800]  state legislatures pass laws that according to the Nuremberg Code are unconstitutional.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  You cannot forcibly medicate somebody or experiment on them. And now government's saying we wanna
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.800]  put statins in the water, lithium in the water, the federal government's proposing it. They're
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:21.800]  proposing making US troops take lithium because they're committing suicide so much.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.800]  Yeah, turn them all into drug heads because you're not paying them enough to live, their
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.800]  families are falling apart, they're sick from DU. I was reading other articles last night
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:35.800]  about the tank crew guys that maintenance them and how they're all dying of cancer.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:43.800]  I mean, because they're fusing DU that ignites in the barrel, and you're cleaning that out
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:49.800]  and you're breathing it. Of course, they're stealing the pension funds of the military.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.800]  Here's an article on the natural news, but it links through to the State Department and
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.800]  Treasury Department announcements. US Treasury raids federal employee pension funds to cover
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.800]  debts. There's a saying, desperate times call for desperate measures. They've been changing
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800]  the laws for years to take pensions.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:15.800]  Bush actually did that. I told you they're coming for him. Roughly, it's an expression
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.800]  that means to be reassuring, conjuring up an image of a true statesman like leader who
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.800]  is prepared to do whatever is necessary to lead the masses out of danger. Of course,
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.800]  the expression doesn't mean the same connotation when it's applied to Obama administration
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  is futile struggle to balance the national books.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.800]  They don't wanna balance it. They're wrecking us for offshore banks, it's globalism. In
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.800]  a letter to Congress earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Geithner said he would be unable
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.800]  to invest fully the federal employees retirement system. And then it goes on to talk about
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.800]  setting up IOUs and rating that like they've already done Social Security. I'll get to
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.800]  more of that later. It's just the criminals that run government are acting like they're
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800]  nothing's gonna be even here soon.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:06.800]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.800]  opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company

[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:33.800]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.800]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never

[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.800]  rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors thankful for the unemployment check since
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:15.800]  you were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.800]  gift, along with thousands of other Americans. If you ever think your future would feel this

[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:12.800]  electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.800]  electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.800]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.800]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.800]  Every year, 1000s of families lose their power from weather related images. Number five, a
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.800]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.800]  believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.800]  sponsors. You can get more information at www dot my solar backup.com. That's my solar

[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:10.800]  or call 1-877-327-0365. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:18.800]  answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:27.800]  Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All these years, they've run the hoax that it's the law to
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:35.800]  take vaccines. And as record numbers of people refuse to take vaccines, they're now passing
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.800]  laws in California and other areas saying we'll vaccinate your children without parental
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:49.800]  consent. It's the same thing in the provinces or sub states up in Canada. They have Calgary
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:55.800]  and other big cities and areas saying that they are not going to Florida anymore.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.800]  So their federal governments rushing and trying to get the provincial government to pass those
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:07.800]  laws. This is the control freak government. And I just cannot get over the fact that in
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.800]  New Jersey now and in Arkansas, they've passed laws saying you must drink fluoridated water.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.800]  And this only happened as the citizens got involved and went in and started getting their
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.800]  counties, their cities to remove it. I mean, they just had a county, one of over a million
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  people in Florida remove it two months ago.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.800]  I mean, it's because they have medical doctors going up and showing them the admitted studies
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.800]  of cancer, brain damage. And it's not just fluoride they add, it's hundreds of toxic
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.800]  chemicals left over from the aluminum smelting industry, nuclear weapons production, and
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.800]  the phosphate mining. This is stuff they can't put on the crops from the phosphate mines
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.800]  for fertilizer, but then they put it in your water.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.800]  Industry lobbyists got government in the 50s to put it in your water. And it just shows
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.800]  how criminal these people are. And now they're talking about forcibly putting lithium in
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:05.800]  our water and statins in our water. So we're healthy and making three year olds start taking
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]  statins.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:14.800]  Later, I want to get into a London Times article from 2009 because I noticed in their archives,
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.800]  they've removed it, but we had saved it. Billionaire Club and bid to curb overpopulation. We just
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.800]  saved a snippet, global research, it turned out to save the whole thing. We do that because
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.800]  they'll deep sixties, ABC News reported on Bill Gates and others meeting in secret for
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.800]  plans to reduce world population, George Soros, Warren Buffett.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.800]  And then that's what their initiatives really are about reducing population. I'm going to
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.800]  put together a report in the next week just showing clips of Bill Gates where he admits
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.800]  this versus, he's doing all this to take care of everybody. Very, very important, I want
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.800]  to get into that. We're working on getting Dr. Corsani on, he's having a Skype problem
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.800]  where we are right now.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.800]  Hillary Clinton urges Security Council to act on Syria. That's big news we're going
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.800]  to get into. Also, is Monsanto buying out Whole Foods? We've done the research, the
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:08.800]  answer is no, but they've used the government basically to pressure their GMOs onto their
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:15.800]  store shelves. And that's why for now about a year, they have signs up saying, we capitulate,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.800]  it's most of the crops are GMO now, you're going to have to eat it.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.800]  So that's a big deal, we're going to be getting in to that report. Also more on scientists
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.800]  creating bird flu, superbug that could set off next global pandemic while posing as our
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.800]  saviors, that's what the globalists are constantly doing. But to understand all of this, the
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.800]  system sells us that they're taking our rights and liberties to protect us.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.800]  But then statistically government is the number one cause of death via these control freaks.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  By the way, a program note, we secured several thousand of bloodlines, the Illuminati, all
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.800]  that there are right now in print. Because it was from such a small little on demand
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.800]  place, it was essentially out of print. And we couldn't even secure a supply of it, so
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.800]  I went ahead and just paid working with the author to print a bunch of these, and I thought
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.800]  we'd have six months supply.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:11.800]  In just five days, we've sold out around a third, I guess, of the books we have. It's
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.800]  going to end up completely selling out at this pace in a week or two. So if you want
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.800]  to get Bloodlines Illuminati before we sell out of it again, it's available at infowars.com.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.800]  This has always been an extremely hot book. This thing sells for as high as $200, $300,
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.800]  four times, five times, six times what we sell it for on Amazon and eBay. Check it out
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]  for yourself.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:41.800]  So you can get the phone book size, book full of documents, you name it. That is an extremely
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.800]  powerful book to understand the globalist mindset and why they're into rituals and the
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.800]  occult and skull and bones. It's the real blueprint for Eyes Wide Shut. It came out,
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.800]  of course, before Eyes Wide Shut. And it's Bloodlines Illuminati. It was such an important
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.800]  book that I made sure it came back into print and at an affordable price at infowars.com
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:09.800]  or call 888-253-3139. That's 888-253-3139.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.800]  Also, this video has been our hottest seller in films and I'm glad, well, I'm in it, but
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.800]  so are incredible researchers, proving that Oklahoma City was and is an inside job to
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.800]  bring in tyranny, as Ron Paul warned. And it's an inside job, as Ron Paul, of course,
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.800]  wrote back in 1995. And his newsletters are trying to demonize him with that right now.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.800]  That just only adds to his credibility. Get A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, 1995, available
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.800]  at infowars.com.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.800]  And don't forget your purchase of the books, the videos, the tapes, supports this broadcast.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.800]  It is also essential, whether you're listening to us in Florida or Texas or New York or California

[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:06.800]  And I wanna thank all of our wonderful affiliates as well out there. We couldn't do what we're
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.800]  doing here, obviously, without you. And that's where we reach the monster audiences. We reach
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.800]  about a million people a day at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. About 700,000 with the
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.800]  audio streams and the podcast combined, audio stream wise, but that can always be shot off
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800]  easily by the globalist.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.800]  The fact that we're on XM and now over 100 AM and FM stations, that's where we're reaching
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.800]  just millions and millions more people. Sure, we reach millions every week on YouTube as
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:40.800]  well, but altogether, 15 million a week, and we couldn't do any of this without you.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:50.800]  Okay, shifting gears now, we have Dr. Jerome Corsi, of course, who wrote the Swift book
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.800]  that brought down John Kerry. He's written many other best selling books. He was critical
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.800]  of George Bush and wrote books exposing the North American Union, the Napa superhighways,
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:05.800]  and I think was one of the chief focal points of helping expose that globalist's plan to
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.800]  take over 84 of our interstate highways and put toll roads on them that really devastated
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:14.800]  for the time being the North American security perimeter that's back under Obama.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.800]  But he's done the research, so has Philberg and others, and I've got to say it's very
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.800]  credible. And since then, they've gone from laughing at us and running that hoax in vanity
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.800]  or in, what was it, Esquire, I forget the big publication that ran the hoax, saying
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.800]  that they had retracted their book about where's the birth certificate when they hadn't to
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]  try to hurt the book.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.800]  That was directly out of the White House, clearly. And now it's come out that his Social
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.800]  Security number was somebody else's in fake in Connecticut and was given to him by somebody
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:48.800]  in the government. And most his family was CIA, that Bush, of course, reported, it came
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:55.800]  out years after, had sent delegates, envoys to Kenya to say, where's his birth certificate?
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.800]  And they said, it's been destroyed and removed. Don't you get it? It wouldn't be there to
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:07.800]  be destroyed or removed, Barack Hussein Obama, Barry Sotaro, if it had never been there to
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800]  begin with.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.800]  And his grandmother says he was born there. But now he's in contempt of court, and Bill
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.800]  Clinton even showed up for court hearings he had to go to for sexual harassment. And
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:23.040]  so the Attorney General of that state is warning him. Secretary of State warns Obama, miss
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.800]  hearing at your own peril.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.160]  Joining us is Dr. Jerome Corsi. And I'm going from memory here, wasn't it? What was the
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.240]  big magazine? I can't remember, I can't believe I can't-
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.400]  You're right, it was Esquire. It was Esquire. So how was that lawsuit going?
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:46.880]  Our lawsuit is pending. The judge has to decide on Esquire's motion to dismiss. But as soon
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.520]  as the judge decides on that motion, the court ought to go forward with the case. So we're
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.600]  waiting, it just takes a long time.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.880]  All right, let's continue here, doctor. Let's start with the basics for new listeners, cuz
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:07.360]  I was on a radio show in Florida on 810 AM, one of our affiliates, a Doc Holliday show.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.880]  And he was bringing up, what's going on with the birth certificate? Crystallize it for
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.520]  me, Alex. Why do we question this? Well, I wanna ask you the same question.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:23.200]  Well, first of all, the birth certificate's been called into question from the very beginning.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:29.320]  Obama wouldn't show the original birth certificate. He produced a short form certification of
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.680]  live birth. And then on April 27th, just before my book was gonna come out, the White House
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:43.320]  suddenly releases this long form birth certificate, which Donald Trump was also pressing, saying,
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.660]  here's the birth certificate. And what the White House released turned out to be a forgery.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:55.600]  We do not have yet the original documentation released from the vault of the Hawaii Department
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:02.040]  of Health. But instead of releasing a PDF file, a computer file, and some Xerox copies,
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.920]  which is what the White House released of the long form birth certificate on April 27th,
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.400]  the White House released an electronic file. And as soon as you open the electronic file,
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.560]  you could see that it had layers in it. It was electronically created. Within hours,
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:22.160]  there were videos on YouTube showing that the file was not a scan of a paper document.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.080]  Yeah, but what about the Connecticut Social Security? When the guy's got somebody else's
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:32.080]  social security number, boom. Well, in fact, we've been reporting Susan
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.920]  Daniels, a private investigator, did the work on this about two years ago, found out the
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.920]  social security number Barack Obama's using was issued in Connecticut, a state Barack
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:48.540]  Obama's never lived in, nor did his family. I mean, even Bill O'Reilly on Fox News was
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:53.560]  covering for Obama, saying, well, Barack Obama's father lived in Connecticut when he went to
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.080]  Harvard. That's not true. He did not live in Connecticut, Barack Obama Sr. And this
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:04.520]  was issued, the social security number President Obama was using today was issued in the late
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:12.680]  1970s. Barack Obama Sr., the father, was gone, deported from the United States in 1964. And
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.880]  Barack Obama Sr. never lived there. The card was originally issued to someone who was born
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:27.640]  in 1890. So let's say someone in the late 1970s, someone who is advanced in their years,
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.960]  maybe an 80-year-old person, a woman, never worked, suddenly wants a social security number
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.720]  to get health benefits, applies and dies. That's the kind of number that's perfect for
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.720]  identity.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.840]  All right, stay there. We got you on a bit, Blake, as to Skype problems. We're going to
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.000]  come right back, Doc. And I want to get into this contempt of court, what this means, back
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.720]  into the other fake certificate, and the fact that this issue won't go away, despite the
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.120]  fact they denounced the whole bin Laden raid right after they put out the fake birth certificate
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.760]  to try to cover all this up. We'll be right back.

[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.880]  So things are really starting to heat up right now. Bill Clinton when he got subpoenaed to
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:28.680]  court over sexual harassment, he showed up. He did the video deposition. But Obama, he
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.360]  didn't show up. And now the attorney general of the state where this happened is getting
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.640]  upset. I want to get into that first doc and get your take on that. But then I want to
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.400]  go back into the latest on the fake birth certificate.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.240]  The hearing was in Georgia and it occurred last week. It was a Georgia administrative
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:53.200]  law judge who has the authority to decide on this case who should or should not be on
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:59.040]  the Georgia ballot for president. This is the presidential primary ballot first in 2012
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:05.800]  this year. And the case was brought by citizens in Georgia arguing that Obama was not eligible
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:11.280]  to be president under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution either because his father
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:17.560]  was a Kenyan and that made Barack Obama a dual citizen at birth, not a natural born
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:22.280]  citizen, or because the birth certificate was forged and false and Obama, there's no
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:29.880]  proof Obama was born in Hawaii. That was the argument. Now, the judge set a subpoena issued
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:36.200]  by one of the attorneys, Orly Tates, to have President Obama appear at the trial. And President
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:44.640]  Obama refused. Also, the attorney for Obama, a guy named Jablonski, sent a letter to the
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:51.720]  Secretary of State of Georgia asking for this hearing to be stopped. Secretary of State
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.240]  refused to stop the hearing, said that the president and his attorney were not appearing
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:04.200]  at their own risk. In fact, the judge had a motion to dismiss the case from the attorney
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.960]  from the president. The judge refused to accept that motion, said that he did not accept the
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:15.080]  legal arguments, that Obama did not have to have two U.S. citizen parents at birth. And
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.360]  when Obama didn't show up, Alex, this is in a sense a default. In other words, the judge
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.560]  was saying, well, he could just issue a default judgment immediately against the president.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:30.760]  But I think the lawyers appropriately for the plaintiffs said, we want to present testimony
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:36.120]  because now there's a court record for the first time, it's historic, both in Obama's
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.760]  case and for a U.S. sitting president, first time their eligibility has been questioned
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.440]  substantively in a court hearing. And without the president or his attorney presenting arguments,
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:53.080]  if the judge makes a decision, hopefully that decision will be on substantive grounds now,
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:59.480]  not just a default, because a substantive determination by the judge that Obama is not
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:06.160]  eligible to be on the Georgia primary presidential ballot this year would be very hard for the
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.280]  president to overturn on appeal.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.560]  This is a big deal, and we're not seeing a lot of corporate, prostitute dinosaur media
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.320]  coverage of this. They wanted to just come out with their hoax with the new birth certificate,
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:25.680]  have Bin Laden come out a week later to kind of overshadow that and just move on. But more
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.640]  and more people realize just how illegitimate Obama is.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:36.600]  Well, it shows like yours, Alex, and I think the work we're doing at wnd.com, which we've
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.640]  been writing about this for years, my book, where is the birth certificate? There's millions
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:45.980]  of Americans that know they're being lied to by the White House on Obama's eligibility.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.400]  It's never been vetted.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.800]  And notice he released that the week before your book was going to come out. I mean, they
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.460]  were scared of your book.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:57.120]  That's right. And then the bin Laden assassination or hit, whatever you want to call it, occurred
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.720]  right afterwards. So you've clearly got to wag the dog effect. And the mainstream media
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.880]  went right along with it. As soon as that April 27th, the White House released the birth
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:12.560]  certificate, the media said, OK, nothing to see here. Now let's all move on. They didn't
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:18.400]  question is this a legitimate document? Why have we waited three years to see it? Why
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:24.880]  can't we see the original documents that remain hidden away in Hawaii, the original birth
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.960]  documents? Why do we have all these contradictory reports? The governor said there was only
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:37.120]  a line item entry in the index of births in Hawaii on Obama's birth. If the governor looked
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.040]  for this long form birth certificate, why didn't the governor find it? I think increasingly
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:48.600]  the evidence is mounting. This long form birth certificate is a forged document, which means
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.920]  ultimately a felony was committed in the White House on behalf of Obama.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:59.760]  And the mainstream media is covering it up. Well, I go back to the magazine article coming
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.800]  out and saying you'd retracted, you'd discredited, you'd admitted it was a fraud. Joseph Farah
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.680]  had admitted it was a fraud and that you were offering retail back, which would bankrupt
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.040]  you on average what you probably sell a book for 35% of its retail to these big distributors
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.600]  to be on the end cap, maybe 40%. So that wouldn't just knock you out for the 100,000 or whatever
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.680]  books you'd printed, it would also hurt you in having to pay that money back.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:31.020]  That was an attempt to totally economically engage in espionage against you and that shows
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:37.000]  how scared they were. If this book was a bunch of bull and if you hadn't brought down top
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.240]  globalists before, they wouldn't have come after you. We're going to come back and cover
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.520]  that. And remember, the Kenyan government said the records of his birth have been removed,
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:50.400]  criminally destroyed. And we can show those documents. They're online.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:57.560]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:06.760]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.600]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.560]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.600]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The silver lungs generator
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:28.000]  infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.440]  the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.240]  the sale of nano silver products. You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:44.480]  with the silver lungs generator. Very easy to follow. Step by step instructions are provided
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:51.160]  making production fast and simple. Go to www dot silver lungs dot com today and learn more

[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.760]  our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.640]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:21.700]  president and Congress. And they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:27.280]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:33.260]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:38.180]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:42.080]  They're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:48.120]  today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:54.800]  of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watching

[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:57.800]  You're in a real crisis. Non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:11.840]  Jones for survivalseedbank.com I should add that Dr. Corsi has had a distinguished
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:19.400]  career after he got his PhD from Harvard University in political science in 1972. And it was done
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.680]  all sorts of interesting work. What is it for the State Department around the world
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.200]  and other things? I have State Department top secret clearance through the agency for
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:34.420]  international development. In the early 80s, I worked on hostage survival techniques for
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.200]  embassy personnel around the world. And a lot of other things you can't talk about obviously.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.280]  So you're not just some wild guy out here attacking Obama, or a crazy guy exposing the
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:48.480]  North American Union, which was official. I remember the trans Texas highway part of
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.160]  the Napda highway official government maps. Ron Paul talked about it five years ago and
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:58.720]  CNN said he was insane and it didn't exist. And they tried the same stuff with you.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.360]  Well, I spent 25 years in financial services. I worked with banks all over the world. I
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.760]  changed careers and became a journalist in 2004 after I co-authored with John O'Neill
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:15.360]  Unfit for Command, the Swift Boat book against John Kerry. And I've written I think 12 or
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:22.840]  14 books since 2004. Five New York Times bestsellers, two of them were number one New York Times
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.400]  bestsellers.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.000]  So they were scared of you. And again, that's the real evidence that it's credible. Not
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.360]  just using somebody else's social security number. Not just the government saying his
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.460]  dad basically wasn't his dad, a sham marriage. That's now come out. Not just, I think one
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:44.000]  of the biggest things is that the Bush administration quietly checked with their government and
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.640]  got the letter back.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:51.280]  And they said, well, it's been removed. Well, if something was removed from his birth, there
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.600]  wouldn't be anything to remove if he wasn't born in Kenya.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:59.800]  Well, that's right. I did extensive research in Kenya, was in Kenya, was detained in Kenya,
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:05.160]  deported from Kenya for wanting to do a press conference revealing the ties between Obama
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.520]  and Odinga, who's now the prime minister. Look, the Kenyan government has notified the
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:15.680]  US government. There's reason to believe that there was a systematic destruction of birth
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:22.200]  records in Kenya so as to remove the evidence of Obama's birth in Kenya.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.800]  And the documents are missing, not because they never existed, but the birth documents
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.960]  in Kenya are missing because the government removed them from the public files. Alex,
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:39.440]  the reason the attorney for the White House did not show up in the Georgia hearing is
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.800]  because the White House knew they would lose. If these issues were really adjudicated in
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:50.760]  a fair court or given a fair hearing to the American people, I think shows like yours
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:58.240]  would bring the truth forward. And the president can't stand the light of day on these issues.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.320]  The real documents, the original birth documents in Hawaii that are supposed to exist are still
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:09.160]  under steel. They're still secret. You can't see them. I can't see them. We have to believe
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.960]  the Xerox copies handed out by the White House and the electronic file. There was no electronic
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:21.200]  birth certificate in 1961. It's a complete forgery. It was created on a computer and
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.900]  it's a lie. And the American people, I think, are catching on to this. Barack Obama has
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:32.640]  lied about being adopted in Indonesia. It was Barry Satoro or Barry Soibarka. We have
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.240]  that information now in his mother's passport application when she removed Barry Satoro
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:45.520]  from her passport, put down Soibarka when they were in Indonesia, when Barry Obama,
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:51.360]  when Barry Satoro, what is his real name, was there from ages 6 to 10. We don't have
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:57.520]  school records. He can't get his applications to Occidental or Columbia or Harvard or whether
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:03.800]  he got foreign student loans, can't get his passport records. This is the most hidden
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.000]  president that we've ever had in American history. And it's that way for a reason because
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.120]  Barack Obama cannot stand for American people to know the truth, which is he's not a natural
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:21.120]  born citizen. He gave up his citizenship, natural born citizenship, when he was adopted
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.720]  in Indonesia. His father was Kenyan, which should have disqualified him from the beginning.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:32.720]  And he's lied about being born in Hawaii. So the entire public life of Barack Obama
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.040]  is nothing but a lie. And it has to be protected by the mainstream media because the mainstream
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:42.080]  media doesn't want the American people to know we've got a political media. The First
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.100]  Amendment is largely dead.
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:50.200]  Now I want to get any other points you've got to make on this subject and then shift
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:55.440]  gears on something you predicted more than a decade ago, this derivatives induced global
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.760]  meltdown and then also how Iran ties into this. You were on with us three, four months
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:06.040]  ago and you said, look, you're going to see more covert actions inside Iran. The war has
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.720]  already begun. Now that idea that the war is actually going on for a while is now basically
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.720]  admitted.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.440]  Yes, that's right. But just to go back to the finish off on Obama, what I want people
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:26.560]  to be aware of is not only is Georgia the state where Obama's right to be on the ballot
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:31.320]  is being contested, is not being eligible. There's like five other states. I think there's
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.860]  going to be eligibility challenges in every state. Just takes one voter in a state to
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:44.540]  challenge the eligibility. And also, Sheriff Arpaio in Maricopa County is conducting a
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:50.200]  law enforcement investigation of Obama's birth certificate and of his eligibility to be president.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.440]  And notice, as soon as that started, the feds basically rated him for human rights violations.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.160]  And the feds came down on him. And look, this entire Department of Justice in Arizona is
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:06.120]  a corrupt office. You've got a corrupt Department of Justice in Washington that's got a political
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.800]  agenda to open the border.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.240]  I got to stop you. It's not enough to call them corrupt with Fast and Furious. This is
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.400]  a group of larcenous criminals. Even CBS News admits they launched Fast and Furious
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.520]  to blame the Second Amendment. And it's killed thousands in Mexico and at least three police
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.400]  and two border patrol here.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.400]  The idea was to argue that the guns in the Mexican drug war were sold to them from the
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.720]  United States so as to limit the Second Amendment. I've got the evidence. I've written about
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:38.720]  that. The Mexican government was saying 80% of the guns are coming from the United States.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.700]  It was all a lie. That was why Fast and Furious occurred.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:47.880]  But now it's money laundering. The border is not about illegal immigrants. The border
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:55.360]  is about $2 trillion of money laundering going through the U.S. and world banks with a complete
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.440]  understanding and cooperation of the American government. I'm about to release that information.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:06.240]  But look, the Arpaio investigation, which is going to come out on Obama, I think is
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:12.400]  going to be the first law enforcement investigation. It's being done very seriously. And the sheriff
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.760]  has said we're going to have the results of that in February. So that results are coming
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.040]  forward very quickly. And that's, I think, going to be another report where the American
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.800]  people are going to get more of the truth from a genuine, honestly done law enforcement
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.800]  investigation.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:32.080]  And I'm very much anticipating what that result is going to be.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:39.480]  All right, Doc, we are too. Let's shift gears now into the economy and then segue into your
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.080]  view on where the Iran situation is going.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:46.560]  Well, as I predicted, again, you're right. I've been writing about this meltdown, my
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.000]  Red Alert newsletter at wnd.com. I've been doing everything I can to tell people that
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.120]  what we've got now is essentially an international Ponzi scheme. We're printing money. We printed
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:05.080]  trillions of dollars of money. Barack Obama's got $6 trillion in deficit. And increasingly
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.640]  I'm believing that's good for the global elite because they figured out how to steal through
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.880]  money laundering a portion of all the debt that's created. I think that's really what
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.240]  this is about.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:24.400]  Secondly, there's no way $6 trillion of debt created by Obama in three years when it took
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:30.240]  the history of the republic to get $10 trillion in debt accumulated. This is a conscious plan
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:37.080]  to undermine the economies of the world to say what we need is a one world currency,
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:43.160]  a one world bank. It's just like Europe. The Euro ought to break up. Greece ought to cause
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.360]  the first country to leave the Euro.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.680]  Instead, the globalists are pouring trillions of dollars in Euro. The Federal Reserve just
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.080]  put a trillion dollars in the Euro.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.280]  I'm using the crises they created to grandstand as the saviors and say countries are gonna
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:03.560]  waive all their rights now to this financial group. So it's an open financial dictatorship
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.400]  of the International Banking Cartel. That's exactly what Barry Goldwater said the Trilateral
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:15.040]  Commission was trying to set up in his 1970s book with no apologies.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:22.120]  That's what, again, I point to with Greece. Greece has just been told by Germany that
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:28.880]  European Union will now take sovereign control out of Greece's hands on their own budget.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.320]  And it will be the European Union that can intervene and tell Greece what it can and
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:38.560]  cannot do with its government operations. The EU is taking over Greece. And that was
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.280]  the plan from the beginning.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:45.640]  Now, the only thing is I think that the globalists are gonna finally overextend and bankrupt
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:52.480]  themselves because I don't see how this house of debt can sustain itself any longer. And
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:58.640]  the solution is not gonna be to go to a global currency or a global international monetary
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.560]  fund controlled economy worldwide. It's gonna be to break up and to go back to national
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.440]  economies and local economies.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:12.200]  The Americans have gotta understand when I wrote America for Sale and warned that the
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:17.640]  globalists were gonna create this crisis to try once and for all to get global control
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:23.440]  of the economy. And we've gotta fight it by saying, let's go back to the 10th Amendment.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:29.080]  Let's say, when government is overextending, it is no longer exerting legitimate powers.
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:33.640]  I'm expecting the United States is closer to a breakup than it's been since the Civil
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:39.080]  War. And we're gonna find, in the next four years, states saying they don't wanna participate
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:43.600]  anymore with the federal government. Use the 10th Amendment, tell the federal government
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:49.460]  to take back welfare, take back the schools. The state will run its own schools. And those
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:53.800]  states which go this path of the 10th Amendment, you know, are basically calling it a return
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:59.280]  to the 1776 nation. And I think it's the only thing that has a chance to save us from the
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.800]  globalism that will ultimately enslave every person on the planet.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:09.280]  Well, I mean, the globalists are so ridiculously transparent. I mean, they're running everything.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:14.600]  They're standardizing everything. They're attacking every form of liberty. They're taking
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.920]  over even cities inside the US and having them jack up power rates for carbon taxes
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:28.480]  and paying it to GE. Every week, it's billions of bailout money to move General Electric's
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.280]  X-ray division to China or General Motors to China or Brazil.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:38.280]  I mean, these people, they're not even just globalist. They really hate America. And they
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:44.240]  always claim, oh, we're doing it for America. No, they want to fully bankrupt this country.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.560]  Why is that, Dr. Corsi?
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.080]  Well, you gotta follow the money. Take a look at these cases like Solyndra, these other
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:57.640]  energy cases. Everybody involved knew that these were gonna be bankrupt. And if the technologies
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:02.680]  worked, China would come in and do them cheaper anyway. But the people behind these companies
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.960]  over and over again are backers of Obama, people who have indebted their whole career
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:13.480]  to the globalist elite. And they get a payday. They get a payoff. And, you know, even the
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:20.680]  banks and money laundering. You get penalties. Well, major banks reserve a couple billion
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:27.440]  dollars for paying money laundering penalties. It's the price of doing business.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:34.400]  You and I would go to jail, but Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, and of course, well-
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:39.200]  None of them are gonna go to jail. Criminal penalties are gonna get waived. They'll pay
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:44.560]  a couple billion dollars in fines, which is a cost of doing business.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.240]  But who's Wells Fargo caught with a 376 billion in launder drugs? Bloomberg reported in just
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:58.320]  two years, they paid $111 million fine. That's less than 0.3% on hundreds of billions. And
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:03.040]  look, it's Warren Buffett, who just shut down the big pipeline from Canada to bring us oil.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.200]  Bloomberg again reported, this is admitted that Buffett is now gonna make huge profits
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:14.560]  off the trains, taking it to the West Coast to ships to China. I mean, these people openly
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.520]  are waging war against our country.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.880]  That's what people gotta realize. Well, we're running trillions of dollars of deficits.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:28.200]  There's hundreds of billions of dollars being stolen by the global elite and put on the
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:35.720]  taxpayers as debt. When you get a situation where there's a major drug war going on in
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:43.520]  Mexico, $2 trillion of the Mexican drug business is no good in $100 bills. You owe us a trillion
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:50.680]  dollars of $100 bills, ways. You can't move it. You've gotta get it into the banking system.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:55.960]  The bankers provide it, the regulators allow it, the Federal Reserve is in on it. And occasionally
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.160]  they slap their wrists with-
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:01.480]  And they see everybody else just trying to live as competition, so they write laws they're
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.120]  exempt from to shut us down. It's called monopoly crony fascism.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:11.200]  You're gonna have two classes. You're gonna have those who are in on the deal or who shut
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:17.880]  up and do extremely well. And then everybody else who's gonna be facing unemployment, bankruptcy,
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:24.840]  starvation, ridicule. But if you dare oppose it, but if you dare speak out like I do, Alex,
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.840]  or like you do, then you run risk of being marginalized.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.400]  Remember the car dealerships? They said if you're a Chevy dealership, this came out in
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:38.600]  Congress. Three years ago, nobody got in trouble. If you own a car dealership and aren't a Democratic
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:44.720]  Party donor, we're taking your dealership from you, in some cases worth $3 to $5 million,
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:46.320]  and giving it to our people.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:50.160]  And people were sent letters and told, you no longer are a Chevy dealership now that
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.640]  the government owns this. We're giving this to somebody else. You still own the land.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:00.320]  You better sell some other cars now. I mean, these people are open mafia dons.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:06.120]  It's same with, okay, you're ridiculed as a birther cuz you dare ask for proof of Barack
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.360]  Obama's nativity. Well, the Democrats weren't birthers when they were questioning John McCain.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.960]  It's entirely political, a double standard. And this attempt to marginalize, who says
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:23.920]  the mainstream media controls what issues can be talked about in the public arena, and
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.040]  which cannot be talked about.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.880]  But wait a minute, this is right out of Atlas Shrugged, where in the movie, they're shutting
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.400]  down the people trying to keep the country going to give it to their monopoly buddies.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.440]  This is right out of the book, shutting the pipeline down.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:43.580]  And it's going on that way on the international scene. It's the entire Federal Reserve sending
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:49.220]  a trillion dollars to buoy up the European Union, so the globalist scheme can advance
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:56.000]  a few more months without collapsing. And it's 1984 because they rewrite history.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.880]  So now, okay, we've written, Barack Obama's entire history, starting from dreams from
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.520]  my father, is nothing but a lie. He says it's fictionalized, characters are made up. We
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.000]  get the documents, and we find out the Immigration Naturalization Service, when Barack Obama
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.400]  was born, did not believe his parents were married and did not believe Barack Obama Sr.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:17.400]  was the father.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.720]  And they say very clearly that if Anne Dunham, the mother, tries to extend Barack Obama Sr.'s
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:28.280]  supposed father's visa stay, on this basis, we're gonna investigate it and deny it.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:32.160]  And that did even come out in the mainstream news, as you know, last year. You talked about
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.240]  it before, and we had as well. But I mean, here's the thing. How do they think they're
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.600]  gonna get away with this long term? Because everybody I know is waking up. Are you seeing
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:42.880]  the same thing happen?
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.880]  Increasingly. I think, Alex, your show's never been more popular. My books have never sold
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:54.080]  better. Even the book that Esquire tried to say was repressed, and we withdrew it, a complete
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.800]  lie, White House released the birth certificate, still became a bestseller, and we still sold
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:04.880]  100,000 copies. It's still selling very well right now and will again when the further
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.880]  information, these eligibility hearings start happening state by state, when the Arpaio
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.640]  Report comes out at the end of February on the birth certificate and Obama's eligibility,
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:20.520]  the issue is not going away. The lie will not get buried, and Barack Obama's gotta realize
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.880]  that eventually the truth will out.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.400]  You're right. We're about to go to break, got a short five minute segment on the other
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.400]  side. I want to get into Iran with you. And if you can go till five after two, cuz our
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:33.920]  next guest is coming up at eight after next hour, two short little segments coming up.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:38.120]  I want to look at Iran, regardless of what side of this you're on. I'm not on any side.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:44.160]  I don't want to have war, but it's just going that direction. We're going to get your view
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.220]  on how that's going to affect things on the other side. Jerome Corsi's our guest. He writes
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:55.640]  for WorldNetDaily.com, WMD.com. We're, of course, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:05.920]  Do you use a CPAP breathing device to help treat sleep apnea and prevent snoring? If
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:09.600]  so, you should know big insurance companies and government regulations can affect the
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.360]  way you buy sleep apnea equipment. They decide what devices you receive, when you get replacement
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:18.800]  equipment and even what you pay. Why limit the quality of your treatment? Break away
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:23.600]  from institutionalized healthcare and shop where you set the sleep therapy standard.

[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:32.040]  Reuters is reporting today that India is saying they may start buying their gold in rupees.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:39.240]  They had said last week it would be in gold that they would buy oil. But now they're talking
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.640]  about using rupees to buy oil. You've got this pressure to shut off the oil exports
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.400]  of Iran. They didn't import a lot of their gas in. Iran looks like they could be breaking
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.520]  a little bit and saying, okay, we'll let the IAEA UN inspectors back in.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:59.940]  Israel says Iran's bluffing about blocking the strait. All of this is just really getting
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:05.240]  to a favorite pitch right now. And the globalist, they want a new war because that'll create
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.120]  a political diversion for them while they're setting up this economic dictatorship in Europe.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.800]  And that's not my words. That's the Financial Times of London, the big victory that Europe's
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:20.720]  agreeing to sign over all their rights to this receivership body of bankers from Goldman
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.840]  Sachs, JP Morgan, and others who engineered the collapse and who are profiting from it.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.880]  So it's basically like Bernie Madoff becoming president because he ripped people off or
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.540]  making Ken Lay your leader. But where do you see this going with Iran? And how does it
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.680]  tie into all these other factors? It looks like things are quickening everywhere.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.360]  Well, it's remarkable. I mean, since I wrote Atomic Iran in 2005, I think right now when
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:51.800]  I predicted, you know, going back to 2005 is just beginning to happen. I think we're
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:58.880]  already in a war. The war has already started between Israel and Iran. All of these assassinations
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:08.220]  of Iranian scientists, the suspicious explosions in Iranian nuclear facilities, the cyber attacks
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:15.920]  on the Iranian nuclear energy industries. This is all orchestrated out of Israel. And
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:22.880]  my guess is also with the help of US intelligence. The war has already started. It's a covert
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:27.920]  war. It's a shadow war. It's going to break out into a shooting war any day. All the signs
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:35.560]  are there. Iran is not going to be able to long sustain a real oil embargo. And the EU
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:41.680]  has said within six months, they're going to begin embargoing Iranian oil. Israel has
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:46.920]  been recently, last few days, saying they think this year there will be a nuclear weapon
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:53.720]  created in Iran and that it may quickly reach the point when it's too late to attack Iran.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:57:01.280]  These are clear signals that Israel is saying a preemptive strike now against Iran is around
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:06.640]  the corner. And the green light has to have been given by the White House. Despite Obama
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.320]  having supported, I believe, radical Islamic interests all through the-
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:13.960]  By the way, I saw the text of a Council on Foreign Relations talk that happened a few
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:21.880]  weeks ago that was an addendum to the article about the, it's time to hit Iran. And they
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.660]  were in there discussing, well, we're going to hit Iran, but we've got to be ready to
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:31.680]  absorb their counter strike and do nothing. And people were all gasping. I don't see the
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:36.160]  United States and Israel when they attack or Israel attacks when Iran responds, not
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:39.040]  responding back. I mean, that sounds delusional.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:44.680]  Alex, I've been working, people say, I'm a warmonger, I've been supported. I've been
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:51.200]  working since 2005 to try to prevent a war. I think a war is the most disastrous thing
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:59.040]  here. Iran has a right to nuclear energy technology. We've lacked a way to work with Iran. Iran
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:05.560]  is crafty. I think this recent round of new negotiations and inspections that Iran's going
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:10.960]  to offer are simply a way of Iran buying more time. Iran has wanted a nuclear weapon and
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:17.440]  they've been on loggerheads with Israel. And the war is now inevitable. When it occurs,
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:19.320]  it's going to be a regional, if not a global war.
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.560]  Hold on, we're back in one minute. I want to hear from your deep research, how you think
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:28.300]  this is going to go once the war starts, what some of the different scenarios are that run
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:31.920]  from bad to worse. We'll only have five minutes with you. We appreciate your time. He writes

[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:24.160]  Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right. You know, I even forgot
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:29.800]  we have calls on the birth certificate. Open the phones up. I am so bad from John Brennan
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:37.360]  and others. And I got Dr. Corsi on. I got into Iran briefly. What are some of the scenarios?
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.880]  How do you see this starting? And what do you see Iran doing? Well, I see almost any
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:49.520]  day now we can wake up and find out that Israel's launched a preemptive military air strike
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:55.600]  against Iran. It can happen any day now. And when it's not just going to be one strike,
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:01.600]  it's going to be an air campaign. It may even involve missiles. I would say that over a
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:08.040]  period of time, it could become nuclear on Israel's point. Israel could use some of its
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:13.960]  tactical nuclear weapons. Within hours of the first strike, Hezbollah in Lebanon will
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:20.640]  certainly launch attacks against northern Israel. Hamas in the Gaza will launch rocket
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:27.920]  attacks. Perhaps Egypt will join. You'll have a regional war within 24 hours. And the regional
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:34.560]  war will be unpredictable. There's going to be thousands of people killed because Iran
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:40.320]  has the capability of launching missiles, even conventional missiles, and killing thousands
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:45.080]  in Israel. And you're going to have sympathetic responses by people in Israel who aren't coordinated
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.560]  or under any flag. They're going to start stabbing, shooting, and blowing stuff up.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:56.680]  And you're going to have other involvement. Saudi Arabia may or may not just stand by.
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:02.400]  Russia may or may not just stand by. Russia is certainly not going to see Iran defeated
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:10.420]  by Israel without some involvement. It's unpredictable. It's like what happens in 1914, or you get
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:11.420]  a World War I...
[02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:14.800]  Yeah, that's how a lot of people describe it as a big roll of the dice. And of course,
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:18.440]  I've also read that Iran's probably got a lot of stuff under their hat that they've
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.740]  gotten from the Russians and Chinese.
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:26.520]  And don't rule out attacks in the United States. You've still got al-Qaeda elements, Hezbollah
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  elements that are active and available in the United States. It may not be a massive
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:36.600]  attack like a 9-11, but there's certainly the capability of having retaliation, terrorist
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.800]  strikes within the United States once the war in Israel, between Israel and Iran.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.200]  And to be specific, you don't mean the type of al-Qaeda Obama used in Libya. You mean
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:50.840]  people affiliated with Wahhabists. But I mean, expanding on that, the Iranian head of intelligence,
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:56.520]  as you know, a month ago, said they would launch attacks in Tel Aviv and in the US asymmetrical.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.080]  That's quite an escalation there, because now the establishment could do a false flag
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:06.560]  and blame Iran. That doesn't sound too crafty by Iran on my part. I mean, I know they are
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.440]  smart, but that doesn't sound smart.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:14.040]  Well, it's why it's unpredictable, because retaliation or a step taken by either Israel
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:22.200]  or Iran once a war starts could escalate it, because it leads to a miscalculation, a retaliation,
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:23.200]  another step.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:27.480]  But that's my point. Clearly, that was fake with the guy wanting to use car salesmen to
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:31.120]  kill the ambassador. But then you have the head of their intelligence saying, we'll do
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:36.600]  stuff like that. I mean, clearly, that would really help Obama if this war starts. That'll
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:40.960]  give him an excuse to grandstand, crack down on the general population.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.520]  No question. Freedoms will be lost in this, as they have been in every war, and that will
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.800]  be calculated. But also, people shouldn't step back and think, this is a war that Israel
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:58.440]  is just gonna automatically win. This is not a board game. It's not a computer game. It's
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:02.520]  not calculated how it's gonna turn out in any way that you can do.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.560]  The Iranians are a lot bigger threat than Iraq.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:12.400]  And the Iranians are highly intelligent, very well trained and equipped, capable of doing
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:19.280]  massive damage. Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza are gonna be coordinated. They've
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  been funded and trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard was
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.720]  causing us trouble in Iraq.
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.960]  Israel couldn't even defeat small contingents of them in Lebanon.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:36.000]  Well, it's possible. Iran's already put components of its nuclear program in Iraq, and we haven't
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.400]  known about it. It's possible that Iran has made agreements with Latin American countries
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:43.440]  that we don't know about to come to the scene.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.840]  Well, Doc, we're gonna obviously have to have you back up. This is just out of control.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.760]  And you're saying it could happen anytime?
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:53.480]  Any day. And it's unpredictable, uncontrollable. And I pray it won't happen. I've done everything
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.120]  I can. Stop it, but it's gonna happen.
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.960]  All right, you're awesome. And I apologize to the callers. Love to get them on with you
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:00.080]  next time. But I'll go to the callers with our next guest.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:05.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:10.120]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.840]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:17.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:22.920]  on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:28.400]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:33.120]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:38.440]  depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency

[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:18.520]  wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond

[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:03.660]  Got it. Others don't. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:08.460]  a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:13.280]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:18.060]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:23.120]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:27.880]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:32.900]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:36.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related images. Number
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:41.400]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:45.160]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:51.880]  my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:08:02.840]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun. So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:09.400]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:12.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:26.920]  All right, we're going to be talking to author, researcher, talk show host Alan Watt here
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:32.680]  in a moment. Here's some of the breaking world news. European leaders adopt treaty pledging
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:37.560]  debt reduction. But when you actually read deeper into it, it says that the countries
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:43.800]  are agreeing to waive what rights they have left and promise to raise taxes and pay basically
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:47.760]  almost everything to the private mega banks that engineered the collapse.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:52.120]  And they're calling it a victory for Merkel over fiscal treaty. So that transfer of power
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:58.600]  looks like they're agreeing to it. Senate bill will force radiation testing of TSA scanners.
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:02.920]  TSA has been caught lying about radiation levels and claiming they've been tested. They
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.000]  violate federal law already, so they're having a new law, and they've got to follow the law.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.040]  How about you? See, that's what happens when agencies are out of control. That article's
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:17.160]  at info.wars.com and prisonplanet.com. Very important to get that out.
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:21.840]  Obama confirms US drone strikes in Pakistan. That'll just make the so-called ally that
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.320]  much more angry with their 100-plus notes. Opposition leader wants Syrian president and
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.400]  his family sodomized and murdered. And I guess they did do that with Gaddafi, so that's what
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.600]  the Al Qaeda forces do. The Al Qaeda admitted Al Qaeda group leader has said that and is
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:38.040]  funded by the West.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:42.480]  We've gotta give all our rights up cuz Al Qaeda might attack us any minute. EU to spend
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:47.080]  3 million euros promoting insects as alternative source of protein. And they're telling school
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:55.460]  kids you won't be able to eat meat in the future. Continuing, Haratz is reporting, Perez
[02:09:55.460 --> 02:10:01.320]  says Iran's evil leaders must not be allowed to gain nuclear weapons. And Israel barreling
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.120]  towards a new war, currency warfare.
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:10.680]  What are the real targets of the EU oil embargo against Iran? That is just some of the news
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:15.520]  we have on that front, and I wanna get our guest take on that. And I know that I said
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.400]  I'd take calls earlier with the last guest. He had a connection problem. We got him on
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.480]  about 15 minutes late, so we never had time to get to your calls. I will take calls, some
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:25.480]  for Alan.
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:30.040]  What, your questions, your comments, the toll free number to join us. I see James is holding
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:37.200]  that the phones were opening the phone system back up, 800-259-9231. And one more thing,
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.560]  we're gonna end tomorrow, the yearly early bird special to watch the nightly news, to
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:47.400]  see all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, the podcast, the video podcast, commercial
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:48.400]  free, all of it there.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:54.400]  The special events, everything at prisonplanet.tv or infowarsnews.com. Both URLs will take you
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:11:01.360]  there. You can get 44% off on a yearly membership now, but that is gonna end sometime tomorrow.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.920]  So if you haven't used that, but we'll continue the 15-day free trial at prisonplanet.tv and
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.920]  we couldn't build this infrastructure and do any of this without your support. We wanna
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:11.920]  thank you so much.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:21.720]  All right, his website is cutintothematrix.com. And he is a musician, researcher, and just
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:27.680]  has an incredible grasp on all things inside this global New World Order system. Really,
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:33.820]  this attempt to construct a alternative technological system for the elite and to insert us more
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:39.080]  and more into an artificial habitat where every facet of our lives are controlled.
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:44.360]  Drugs and chemicals added to the food and water, GMO, forced on us. Like I was covering
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:49.460]  earlier, New Jersey and Arkansas passed laws to forcibly inoculate. Well, California's
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:54.280]  passed a law to inject your kids without your consent. This is to forcibly inoculate our
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:12:00.640]  bloodstream with the deadly sodium fluoride on record that they know is killing people.
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.720]  So when you start getting control of your cities and saying no, they're coming and saying
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.800]  we're gonna force it on you. And they're now, the American Medical Association came out
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.000]  last week and said, we wanna forcibly inoculate the public as well.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.160]  So they're really taking the velvet glove off the iron fist. Alan, I didn't talk to
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:21.560]  you before you came on with us. I got a lot of stuff I wanna ask you. But out of the gates,
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.040]  what is front and center on your radar screen?
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:32.760]  Well, we're definitely going to war with Syria and Iran in whatever order they choose, maybe
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:38.720]  at the same time, in fact. And of course, at the same time at home, we're going into
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.880]  massive austerity, which is to be the world's system from now on. And even the Federal Reserve
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:52.440]  head man there said that you're going to see inflation for 20 years inside the U.S., gradual
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.120]  inflation. And so that means at the end of 20 years, everything's gonna be double the
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.840]  price or more.
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:03.840]  So we're going into a planned, a planned long goal, by the way, planned austerity for the
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:11.560]  whole world while your disposable income goes to taxes and fees to fight wars and to redistribute
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:17.840]  the wealth across the world. The Marxian concept is here and implemented. And of course, everyone
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.120]  thinks that Marxism was completely opposed to capitalism and nothing is further from
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:28.840]  the truth. Capitalism and communism are set up by the same boys. It's a dialectic process.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.720]  So they're bringing together their plan exactly as Lenin said they would be. Lenin said that
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:41.040]  the communist system would eventually after a generation, about 70 years or so, change
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:44.840]  and stop being so insular in Russia.
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:48.520]  And then it would spread into the West and the two would merge and become something in
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:54.800]  between capitalism and communism. Well, this is it folks, you're here already. And it was
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:14:00.440]  planned long before you were born. These guys make long, long term plans, and they always
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.440]  pull them off.
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:07.160]  And by the way, you're not just saying this, they admit it's beautiful to have a post industrial
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.260]  world. We're going to shut you down so you can't afford to have children. We're going
[02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:17.320]  to force drug you. I mean, in Austin, they've announced carbon taxes, 80% increase in power
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  bills.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:23.600]  And they said it's for the earth, and we're gonna pay it to a foreign company. I mean,
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:28.840]  it's just we're doing this because we want to, and we've gotten leaks out of Bilderberg
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:33.280]  and other groups where they say people are too uppity, we wanna make you poor. Isn't
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:35.040]  that just feudalism?
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:39.480]  It is feudalism. But again, we were told this by the historian for the group that created
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:46.400]  capitalism and communism, Carol Quigley, he said that this new feudal system would be
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:52.360]  the new feudal overlords and the feudal system of the world would be the CEOs of the international
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:57.480]  corporations working with government. And that's what you have. It's already here. It's
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:03.720]  been here for quite some time. And we see that with the big banking companies across
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:12.280]  the world just plundering and taking everything over into every country in the world. Literally,
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:18.840]  it's a private organization that runs the world. And democracy is simply a front to
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:25.160]  get the radical groups, which they pay, by the way, the NGOs, to protest and demand that
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:31.600]  we go into the system even quicker and faster into the same utopia where we share our wealth
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:37.760]  with the whole planet, basically. So there's been no favorites in this new world order.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:43.320]  Every country's be leveled to the same extent pretty well. We see the same thing happening
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:50.040]  with your medical system in the US. The Rand Corporation was hired to do a study to see
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:55.120]  what Obama's care would be like. Who should they choose as a model to copy? They copied
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.680]  Britain. Britain's national health service is in utter disgrace. You can't get cataracts
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:03.200]  treated nowadays. You have to go elsewhere to get them done. Can't get any operations
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.560]  done, things like that. And yet the US has to copy that, and they're closing down wards
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:13.320]  in hospitals across the US right now, and it's been kept very quiet. So you're really
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:18.240]  going into a state where you'll be at the level of the Philippines eventually once they're
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:19.240]  finished.
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:20.240]  Continue.
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:28.400]  Well, the CFR, people keep missing the Council on Foreign Relations, which is just one branch
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:33.440]  of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is the big world order system. They
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:38.520]  connect all the corporations together. They have their members in IBM right across the
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:43.840]  board and all the big banking systems. And they also have all their members staffing
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.760]  the Bank for International Settlements, which is the bank which oversees all central banking
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:54.680]  for every country. And they own all the media. And they tell us where they're taking us and
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.440]  how fast they're going, and they even give you time levels for implementations of different
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:06.920]  parts of this big agenda. And they're all for carbon taxes, for austerity, and they
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:13.000]  have no problems at all about literally eliminating what's left of what's called the middle classes.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.560]  And you're already replaced. We had to all replace the middle class, really, by technocracy.
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:23.760]  Technocrats really are running this show. They'll be kind of semi-important, but the
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:28.360]  general middle classes are gone. If you go back even further to a high member of the
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:33.480]  same organization, Margaret Thatcher, she said that eventually, she says, we'll eliminate
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:38.080]  all small private businesses. It'll be only international corporations, and that's the
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:42.760]  way it'll be. And she made it almost impossible to run a small business because half the day
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:47.280]  you were doing paperwork for the government. So it's the same in the States right now,
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:51.560]  Canada, elsewhere across the world. We're also seeing countries selling off their national
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:57.080]  assets. Greece and New Zealand is doing it too. Other countries are following. Rothschild
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:02.480]  himself put forward the bill in Britain last year to sell off the British roads to private
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:07.720]  international corporations. So we're interdependent. In other words, there are no real nations
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:12.160]  anymore, as Von Rompuy said in his speech.
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:16.280]  And just to insert something here, backing up what you're saying again, I remember a
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:21.720]  decade ago, and then a few years ago, and again, just last week. In the US, Europe,
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.280]  and England, Australia, New Zealand as well, they've cut the white collar crime and the
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:32.720]  investigators for tax evasion for billionaires. They don't exist, and they've put them on
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:34.000]  small businesses.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.200]  And now they announced last year, they're gonna focus on blue collar who almost pay
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.640]  no income tax just so there's no enforcement. And it turns out all the rich guys pay almost
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:51.120]  no taxes. Then they double back and say raise taxes on the rich, it's not fair, but the
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:57.400]  proposal only raises it on the middle class. I mean, it is so diabolical. They are harassing,
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:02.840]  IRS tells small businesses, we don't like you, we like big companies, we're gonna shut
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:03.840]  you down.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:09.280]  Yeah, and they are shutting them down too, and really going after them in every single
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:14.280]  country, there's no exception. Cuz the world order, people think, well, it can be the whole
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:19.000]  world. Yes, it is the whole world. It's our world order. And every country signed on to
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.400]  this world order at the end of World War II, when they signed the charter and the treaties
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:31.520]  at the United Nations in San Francisco. So this is all part of this ongoing new world
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:37.880]  order, a form of Marxism, basically, for the people. And Britain, as you know, Britain
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:46.920]  is the big flagship for testing communitarianism. Where literally, you displace your local councils,
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:53.320]  elected councils, and you now have appointed technocrats, basically, that already belong
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:54.320]  to the-
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:58.560]  Let's explain that. Let's explain that, Alan, on the other side, and get into the super
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.480]  flu, SOPA, and more.

[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:07.880]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:12.200]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:17.000]  is home watching television with Fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.880]  makes the same light as a real television. So from outside, it looks like someone is
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:25.820]  home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:31.120]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:35.400]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your Fake

[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:01.360]  deterrent.

[02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:14.120]  fastest outdoor fire. Think about the magnitude of all over the world now trying to forcibly
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:19.480]  inoculate and forcibly fluoridate water as cities, states and counties and sub-states
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:26.960]  and jurisdictions wake up to it. Think of how horrible it is they're trying to do all
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:32.320]  these home and farm inspections now with this new bureaucratic class to eat out people's
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:33.320]  sustenance.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:42.780]  I remember reading an article in the Austin American Statesman about 15 years ago where
[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:49.160]  Tyson Chicken had thousands of violations at one plant alone, but a smaller plant had
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:54.760]  one violation and got shut down. And that's even in an establishment publication they
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:59.300]  admit that. That's what this is all about, shutting everything down. And what's out of
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:04.420]  control is they wanna shut it down to get you impoverished so you're on welfare, living
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:09.640]  at subsistence levels so they can force vaccines and things on you.
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.800]  They force those on people to get their welfare so they can basically soft kill you. And Alan,
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.620]  they've got a problem though. More and more it's coming out that they've got cures for
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:22.940]  cancer but won't let people have it, that the vaccines are killing people. People are
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:25.000]  waking up to the global banksters.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.940]  I'm seeing all sorts of awakenings happening. And I know you're usually a little pessimistic
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:37.320]  as you realize how organized this is, but I do see a challenge of these globalist.
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.640]  Well the thing is though, you can remember at all times, everything that you're experiencing
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:48.480]  now because of the agendas going forward forth and released into the news. Everything was
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.120]  planned many, many years ago, including, I mean they have a thousand think tanks working
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:58.280]  on every aspect of society, including how we'll react to the news 10 years down the
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:03.240]  road when they release something. And they go through it like a chess game. Okay, they'll
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:07.700]  react this way. How can we counter that? They work it all out abstractly before they actually
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:13.280]  go into action and do it. And so they've got pretty well everything figured out. And we
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:18.360]  are easily distracted as well. And to be honest with you, these guys are not gonna give up
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:24.040]  after working at this for well over 100 years in the open.
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.040]  That's called the open conspiracy according to H.G. Wells, well over 100 years. They're
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.520]  gonna give up because people start to protest. They've been building internal armies up in
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:33.520]  every major country.
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:37.520]  Well no, speaking of H.G. Wells, he said there's gonna be a lot of beautiful, well-meaning
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:39.580]  people. We're gonna have to kill for the new world order.
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:44.000]  That's right. It's as many decent people will die protesting this new world order,
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.880]  die in vain. That's what he said, so-
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.440]  And you're right, they're militarizing. The TSA is there to train you, to let us grab
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:55.920]  your children's crotch in front of you. It just totally break your will. It's absolutely
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:57.640]  criminal, but they just do it.
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:02.720]  Yeah, and also too, he talked about they would make up a military class. And of course, we
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.800]  have a military class now. It's so easy to get young guys and indoctrinate them into
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:13.080]  being separate from the general public as old techniques of course, but very, very effective.
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:18.540]  And in Britain, they're training the paratroopers who are shock troops to deal with the next
[02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:20.480]  demonstrations in Britain.
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.200]  And remember, before they wanted to announce all this, we were conspiracy theorists to
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:28.320]  get the documents. Now it's just, yeah, the Marines are trying to take your guns and kill
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:29.320]  you.
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:34.220]  We'll secretly arrest you. Yeah, the paratroopers, BBC, are preparing to, and it shows them searching
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:39.320]  women on the side of the street. Yeah, the TSA is gonna stop you at checkpoints. And
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:43.200]  they take these young men, tell them you're part of the elite. They're hiring all the
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:47.680]  Boy Scout, Explorer Scouts in the news, and they're training to kill veterans.
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:53.360]  Yes, there's no doubt about it. And they're quite open with everything. Most folk, of
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:28:01.760]  course, most people who are outside, say Patriot Radio, they go into disbelief. They hear it,
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:06.200]  but it is not real to them. They can't imagine, it's unreal. And so they dismiss it.
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:11.480]  Let me stop you again. When it came out about five years ago, they were trained Explorer
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:16.640]  Scouts in every drill to take on gun owners, farmers, people dressed up literally in John
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:22.800]  Deere outfits and overalls. I would have Explorer Scout people call me going, we are trying
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:25.560]  to take on extremists, but you're anti-scout.
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.240]  So I'm right about this, but I'm still bad. Or it can't be true, and then when it came
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.760]  out, well, it's okay. And then now it's in the New York Times and other publications,
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:40.840]  it shows little boys training to kill veterans and training to kill guys dressed up in John
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:46.000]  Deere outfits. I mean, they train them to kill farmers. If you're into freedom and self-sufficient,
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.320]  they're training giant armies of children who are now many of 19 from the first wave
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.080]  of training to kill you.
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:58.440]  Yes, and again, this technique was intensely studied by the West, of course, that worked
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:02.960]  with the Soviets. And the Soviets always say that you go for the child first and you make
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:07.080]  sure they're yours. It's quite easy, again, to indoctrinate a child, and they are yours
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:08.080]  for life.
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:13.480]  I've got the old newscast where it showed the tax police are orphans, and they train
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:18.040]  kids from age five up to 20 to beat people up for the tax money.
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:24.440]  Yes, and also the CIA, of course, were instigating in Cambodia. And we know what they did there.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:28.200]  They trained, it was the young children that gave the machine guns to blast the-
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:33.960]  Let's talk about that when we come back. Yeah, just the boy scouts are being taken over.
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:38.520]  Guys type in during the break, girl scouts and brownies trained to fight terrorists.
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:43.440]  And then the little girls are trained to spy on mommy now. But it's for the homeland after
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:50.760]  all. It's for Uncle Chertoff and Mr. Napolitano.
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:30:02.320]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:07.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.360]  opportunity, and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:16.680]  can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are
[02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:21.720]  triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable
[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:28.040]  and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials. Your
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:34.280]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:38.180]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never
[02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:42.140]  had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:07.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:12.480]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:17.440]  from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our president and
[02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:23.960]  congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:29.280]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:34.840]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:38.880]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:43.000]  matches and the congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today it seems like
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.600]  nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic. Get

[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:30.540]  craziness there's only one thing you can control, your greatest dependency, your food supply.

[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:32.320]  My friends, we have the partnership announced a few years ago with the Girl Scouts and Homeland
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:38.920]  Security and Preparedness Patch. And then if you read deeper into it, you then discover
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:43.340]  it's spot terrorists and trained to fight terrorists, but the girls are mainly the good
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:44.340]  little spies.
[02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:49.260]  And of course, then I have footage from 1998 in Hebron, Maryland and other places in Police
[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:55.080]  State 2000 of young children training to go in their parents' houses can come back and
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:00.400]  report to regular Marine Corps. This is on video, what guns they own. And since then
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:06.600]  we've seen drills in Arcadia, Iowa, you name it, that literally have mind control in them.
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:12.700]  The article says they're training with a local gun shop owner with a 670 something residents
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:18.600]  to go door to door looking for guns they're gonna pre-hide in a drill for civil emergency.
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:30.040]  And for domestic operations. Then they have the drill, I talk badly of it. And they say
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:33.240]  in the news, I'm a conspiracy theorist cuz I don't like it.
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:37.800]  Alan Watt, that's the new level of control where they admit we're right, but then say
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:40.480]  we're a conspiracy theorist for not liking it.
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:45.800]  Yeah, they're using a herd instinct and they talk about this too, how the most folk want
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:54.360]  to comply with government. Most people do, unfortunately. And for those who comply, whatever
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:58.720]  you do that's against government is therefore bad, naturally. So goody two shoes, they're
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:02.040]  all trained to be goody two shoes. They're trained at school, of course, in group thing
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:07.360]  too, where there's no dissension, you almost come to a common agreement. And so everyone
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:12.480]  wants to be the same as everyone else. And government is good. They've watched all the
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:17.640]  movies. How many movies are out there to do with Homeland Security, stopping spies, all
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:21.360]  fast paced dramas, Eagle Eye, all these kind of things.
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:26.760]  And they think this is fantastic, youngsters. And apart from that, there's a lot of pre-programming
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:32.760]  with unpredictable programming. Even in the 90s in Canada, you had a series here where
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.520]  young youngsters got together and formed their own spy group and spied all their neighbors
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:38.520]  and appearance.
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:43.800]  So when I go to the toy store, like have the toys that are spies and spy on your parents,
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.680]  it's fun, you're a secret agent. And this is the same technique that they use again.
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:52.880]  By the way, almost all the toys, I never see them that say USA or anything, it's always
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:58.480]  UN Defense Force. But the GI Joe guys don't have smiles on their faces now, they've all
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:01.240]  got like, ugh, yucks.
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:06.960]  Well, Plato said it, he said that if something works in a generation, whatever formula works
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:10.860]  to make the culture go one way, as long as you know the formula, you can reintroduce
[02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:13.580]  it down the road, it will always work again.
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:17.160]  This is the same techniques the Soviets used with the Young Communist League, where parents
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:22.360]  didn't say anything in front of their children, wearing their own communist uniforms.
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:28.560]  Same in the Nazi system, parents were terrified when their children joined the Hitler Youth,
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:31.800]  and they were told to spy on their parents and turn them in.
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:36.600]  It will always work with children. And they know this at the top, they're the masters
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:42.760]  of war, they've been doing this for centuries. So it's a very dangerous time for everyone.
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:46.640]  I mean, I've had parents, you've probably had it too, who've called me and have actually
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.880]  said that they're afraid of their child.
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:55.760]  Oh, that's the system, and then they come in their black uniforms and sit around the
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:59.520]  kitchen table. I've read about this in every culture, and the parents grovel, and the kids
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.600]  get off on it, and kids now are told, I can report you for spanking me, I can report you
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:10.400]  for what you said. I saw a case a few years ago, where they took a guy's kids, because
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:13.480]  he said, don't trust the police in Round Rock.
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:17.780]  Don't trust the government, and don't take shots if they tell you to. And it was on the
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:23.440]  news that, well, CPS is taking the children, because the police say, he said, don't trust
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:28.640]  them. I mean, that was on the news, and boy, I later heard those kids were absolutely in
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:29.640]  hell.
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.860]  Because once they were with the little pedophile rapers, they found out, people find out once
[02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:37.280]  they get in the clutches. You thought mommy and daddy were bad? Now you're going to meet
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.840]  a pot-bellied rapist.
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:44.840]  Yes, and George Orwell also put this in 1984, his book and a movie, where the youngsters
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:49.520]  are dressed up with little outfits. And they're maybe around seven years old, and they're
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:53.640]  saying to Winston, oh, you're a thought criminal. You're a thought criminal, aren't you? They're
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:55.440]  going to report you.
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:00.240]  And so they've surely gone around to terrifying everyone who's an adult. And this is the way
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:08.600]  they're getting raised in school. And so America itself, and every other country too, is divided
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:15.760]  in many different sections. And part of it is between young children and even older children,
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:16.760]  they've got different indoctrination.
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:22.060]  So there's three or four indoctrinations on the go at the same time with different generations.
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:25.360]  And that's part of the problem. But it's been orchestrated this way, and it's all managed
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:28.480]  this way by those who oversee the whole system.
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.720]  Well, take the TSA pedophile training force. I mean, all these psychologists have come
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:37.640]  out and said, it's training kids. That's how a pedophile will touch to test to see if the
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:42.040]  kid will go along with it. This is totally screwing kids up. They're grabbing the women's
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:47.400]  breasts, going in the pants, radiating everybody. And of course, we knew this was the plan,
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:49.560]  but now they're going on the streets, the highways.
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:55.100]  It's clearly a program to train us. We have absolutely no rights, and the state's going
[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:59.560]  to put their hands on us. And now the cops take the blood, that's training them for medicalization.
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:03.900]  I remember a decade ago, they couldn't get the cops to carry out forced inoculation.
[02:39:03.900 --> 02:39:08.200]  So they said, we'll get them to do other medical stuff first to create that. So now they're
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:11.040]  going to be medical enforcement officers.
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:15.180]  Yes. And they've even had that in science fiction movies for the last four or two years
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:18.800]  this would come. Because these guys are all picked, of course, for predictive programming
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:24.680]  too. But we're in it now. And you're under martial law, and they're training the public,
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:29.560]  that's training the public, that's all it is, into complete obeyance and fear, fear
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.320]  of reprisal if you don't comply.
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:37.520]  It's incredible, even in situations in the main stations, the train stations in New York,
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:42.760]  places like that, with the screens everywhere, running these little promos about Homeland
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.320]  Security. And we have 200 agents right now amongst you right now in this place.
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:55.040]  And only trust government, only tell us screens at Walmart and Mall of America and town squares
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:00.160]  like out of a dystopic nightmare science fiction movie. Watch everyone, only trust us. What's
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:04.640]  your neighbor doing, your children being trained, little discount credit cards given to them.
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.840]  No, report on your parents, and I have those promos, I've played them. And they're doing
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:15.160]  it all with a completely, totally straight face to everybody.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:20.480]  It is so incredibly diabolical, and they're pushing it into overdrive right now. Why is
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:21.480]  that?
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:25.400]  They're pushing it overdrive because they have talked about more riots, but they have
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:32.360]  to put their plans to crashes again economically. And to get us down to the proper level of
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:36.440]  austerity, you see. You still have it too good right now, you can still afford an ice
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:37.940]  cream once in a while.
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:43.700]  So you got to come down much further because they want all that extra cash that you spend
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:45.260]  on yourself.
[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:50.440]  But more importantly, they can buy you. Once you're totally broke back in your hierarchy
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:54.360]  of needs and are starving, you'll do whatever you're told.
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:58.680]  Food is a weapon, of course, and I've said that at the Ministry of Agriculture, the United
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:02.720]  Nations that they're willing to use. Actually, the UN has used food as a weapon. That's what
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:03.720]  them bar goes on.
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.440]  That's memorandum 200. The Onion came out this week and said, it's great, let's kill
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:12.460]  billions of people. And let's mow down Africans. But in the real world, the New York Times
[02:41:12.460 --> 02:41:16.920]  is reporting, hey, the UN's mowing down people for their land. It's for the Earth, maybe
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:17.920]  it's good.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:18.920]  That's right.
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:19.920]  Mowing down, it's less trendy.
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:24.840]  They're really going after the farmers, small farmers. There's very few small farmers left
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:30.860]  really. It's all big agri-farm, five corporations around the world, all the food supply. And
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:36.120]  in Australia, they can't even allow them. They're creating national parks and they're
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:40.600]  telling the farmers to get their cattle off them. So there's going to be no meat for the
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:43.680]  ordinary folk in the future. That is the plan too, is vegetarian society.
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:46.840]  Oh no, I have a news out of England today where they're teaching kids they're going
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:48.400]  to eat bugs for protein.
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:52.720]  That's right. Oh yeah, they've been doing that for four or five years. And the EU has
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:57.760]  allocated the 3 billion euros to the study of it, or 3 million euros to the study of
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:02.120]  eating crickets and things. And then you have the Hollywood stars. There's one major Hollywood
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:07.760]  star who says her children just love these cricket sandwiches. They always find someone
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:13.400]  because the people follow the stars, right? So this is the future, is complete and utter
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:17.920]  austerity. And then you go back two or three years and you find the head of the Green Party
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:23.280]  who said, oh, you know, everybody obeyed in World War II. They had very little money.
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.280]  They didn't mind-
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:27.520]  They're going to have carbon rationing guards and now they're announcing them.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:32.240]  That's it. So I said this in 2001. That's what you'll see. Everything that goes with
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.880]  warfare you will see at home, including refugees eventually being moved around the country.
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:37.880]  Yeah.
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:41.040]  Yeah. And it'll be, oh, we got to put these homeless people in the sports stadium that's
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:47.800]  already begun in Tampa and in Northern California, Central California, in Sacramento. You can't
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:53.400]  have homeless out at night. They got to be locked up. And oh, we got to arrest the dissenters.
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:54.720]  They're causing problems.
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:43:02.000]  Yes. And so they are ready for, it's not really a planned rebellions they're ready for. They
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.440]  don't believe they're going to be a planned rebellion, but they do believe there'll be
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:09.600]  a spontaneous riots as people get to go who are at the bottom of the ladder get hit even
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.600]  harder.
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:13.560]  And then they'll use them to say, see, we got to raise the taxes on the rich. That means
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:18.520]  somebody making 50,000 a year or 100,000 to pay them. And then all the money siphoned
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:23.400]  off the foreign banks. But the unwashed masses don't know because they literally, I've talked
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:28.160]  to some of the general public, they can't talk now. The language is gone. And if you
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:33.000]  bring up a serious issue, they begin to laugh at you with a pre-programmed response.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.960]  That's right. Every response that you see from anyone out there has been either a comedy
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:41.680]  or a movie or some soap or whatever.
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:45.440]  No, they're not their own person. They live in a playland of arrested development that
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:49.600]  the psych warfare chief talk about. And they'll repeat something that they think makes them
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:55.200]  look blingy. Instead of actually being intelligent, it's just all a big fake. And like the yuppies
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:01.040]  watch the news that's propaganda and repeat it like they're real smart. Ooh, yes, ooh.
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:06.560]  Well, that's what Brzezinski said, the public will be unable to reason for themselves. All
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:11.080]  they'll be able to do is to repeat last night's news to each other. And that was in the 70s,
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.360]  he said that. So we're here, we've been here for a while.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:17.840]  And men try to impress each other on talk radio about how upset they get for their team.
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:22.900]  And they just sit around like men 5,000 years ago would talk about defending their village
[02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:28.200]  with the same concern against marauders. It's just like, yeah, man, I tell you, we gotta
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:32.600]  have the Giants win or I don't know what I'll do. Meanwhile, their kids being fed GMO, they're
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:38.280]  gonna be sterile. They're gonna get cancer at age 17 probably, total death and the numbers
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:39.280]  are increasing.
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.460]  We're being murdered. And you talk to that man, they'll look at you and just laugh cuz
[02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:47.480]  you're not manly. You're not manly, Alan Watt. You don't know how to stand around and go,
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:52.720]  ooh, football, ooh, 12, ooh, ooh. While poison's putting our water and food. I mean, you're
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:53.720]  just not a man.
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:59.080]  That's it. That's it. They're all conditioned, but they will obey government. They will obey
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:00.080]  government.
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:04.440]  Oh, these guys will bug their eyes out at you and have their shirts cut off. And I'm
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:07.320]  not saying there's anything wrong with that, folks. The one is, you see them in the grocery
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:10.120]  store or whatever, walking around here and act all sinister. You see these tough guys
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:16.440]  when they see a cop, they look like a dog, like groveling, almost rolling, they're just
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:17.440]  total cowards.
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:24.560]  Yeah, they are. And again, they can only act as a mob. So the problem is, as I say though,
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.280]  that the big boys are ready for all of this. They've planned it. They probably will even
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:33.360]  set off the riots themselves, but them often it's time. And that's the usual thing. They
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:36.520]  don't wait until people do something. They generally do it because they have the plans
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:38.360]  and timetables.
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:41.240]  And then of course they'll turn around and say, see, there are crazy folk amongst you
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:44.760]  out there who are going to riot. And so we need even more security.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:49.200]  Well, in England, which we'd all predicted, the police stood down. It turned out a lot
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:52.280]  of those riots were organized, pushed by the media.
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:59.820]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And mind you too, every organization is infiltrated. And every area,
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:03.920]  they have their instigators living amongst them, by the way. And they go out and drink
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.920]  with them, all these young guys.
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:08.200]  Hey, before I knew how bad it was, I don't know, six, seven, eight, nine years ago, a
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:12.640]  few times I worked with a few people locally who later I found out were sabotaging, lying,
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:18.200]  doing everything you could imagine. And it had to be professionally being done. And you're
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:20.440]  just like, my God, you people are everywhere.
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:26.600]  Well, one case came up in Montreal recently. It was a policeman, but he was one of the
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.400]  three who had access to all the informers to do with what they call the local mafia
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:37.840]  in Montreal. It's not an Italian mafia, but it is a mafia. And he was going to turn over
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:45.480]  2,000 informant spies in Montreal alone to the mafia, 2,000. And I've told people for
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:49.360]  years, you don't realize that since the 50s that had these people placed-
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:55.320]  It's now admitted, the cable person, the phone person, everyone. And I've noticed this, usually
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:58.720]  they end up being a listener, but a lot of times you can just tell when the person doesn't
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:01.880]  know whose house they're at and I get home late or whatever. And I mean, you can just
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:06.040]  see that whoever's in your house, they're casing it, they're looking at things.
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:10.760]  You can see it's a power trip that they're watching you. And it's on record they are,
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:15.440]  but I mean, nurses at hospitals, everywhere, they get off on the little informer-ness and
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:18.120]  they get little cuts of juicy too. They get a little money.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:24.360]  That's right, promotion at work or something. But as I say, this technique is very old and
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:29.280]  it works very, very well. They know how to bring countries down. They did it with East
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:34.080]  Germany too. They've had so much experience and everything's documented as a massive laboratory
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:35.080]  when they do these experiments.
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:40.880]  Well, no, Disney World, I was reading, now calls its parks a laboratory. And it turns
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:44.520]  out they taught the Department of Defense how to lock a city down. Because think about
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:48.000]  it, you're getting in, you're being scanned, you're being controlled, you're being surveilled.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.360]  Disney systems are the model of actual what'll be gulags.
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:56.160]  Yes, and they had to remember the wristbands with the chips in them to get inside.
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:01.080]  Biometric scanning and you're under laboratory scanning. Let's go to a phone call. James
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:06.320]  in Minnesota, then Tara, JD, Noah, and CJ. Go ahead, James.
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:07.320]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:08.320]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:14.200]  Do you hear me? Yeah, I wanted to talk about a, and of course I want to say what a pleasure
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:20.480]  it is to be on with you. I wanted to talk about a misunderstood subject, which is the
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:27.840]  separation of powers doctrine, the 10th article and amendments. And what I see is that prior
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:34.160]  to 39, it was unlawful for the federal government to come in and tax the state employees.
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:39.320]  And likewise, it was unlawful for the federal government to tax the state employees.
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:45.560]  Yeah, the income tax wasn't even really used until 51. It doesn't run the country and it's
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:48.720]  all paid to the private offshore banks. Do you have a question for Ellen Watt?
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:57.360]  Well, this gets into the matter of visitation, okay? And the fact of the matter is, is that
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:01.160]  when they passed the Public Salaries Tax Act, that provided for agreements where in any
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:04.480]  state that entered into an agreement with the federal government, the federal government
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:09.920]  can now tax their state employees. And likewise, the states could then tax the federal employees
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:13.960]  and it was constitutional because it only applied to the government employees.
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:17.800]  That's right. Listen, I got to jump here because we just got limited time with our guests.
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.120]  What's your questions for Ellen Watt getting into technical vagaries? Bottom line, the
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:26.780]  feds are completely criminal, out of control, federalizing everything. I mean, they're really
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:28.280]  coming out in the open, Alan.
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:37.400]  Well, they don't care about constitution or laws. Power is law, that's it, yeah.
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:41.120]  Let's talk to CJ in Michigan. You're on the air, CJ.
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:49.780]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Alan. Yeah, calling from the prison state of Michigan. I want to ask your
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:55.320]  guests, I heard you talk about Alex, about the hope and not giving up. I definitely want
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:58.240]  to tell you that I am not, I'm very optimistic.
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:04.440]  Professor Muhammad said, if you see the end of the world coming and you have a sapling
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:10.080]  to plan it, that just, that means, you know, keep going to the end. But it's, I talk to
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:15.600]  people and I get kind of everyone's soul, like, you know, I don't know, forehead head
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:24.600]  or whatever, but it's hard to be optimistic. Can you point us to some, to some hope?
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:32.320]  Hope comes from each individual that understands what's happening. The problems occur where
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:37.780]  you join groups that are pre-made for you to join. That's an order infiltrated immediately
[02:50:37.780 --> 02:50:45.600]  and it gets spun off into another diversion. Individuality can do so much, like that guy
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:51.160]  who refused to vote the White House, the sports player. He is an individual who stood up and
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:55.520]  he said that I speak as an individual. If the government is out of control, I will not
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:51:24.760]  attend this function. Individuals count. Stay there. That's right. Individuals count. We'll
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:41.960]  get them out of control, you know?

[02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:10.440]  Don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:54:11.580 --> 02:54:18.740]  Okay, the official radio show will be over in five minutes. Well this hour will be and then I'll be back tonight seven o'clock
[02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:26.180]  Look the caller asked a very very serious question, but I'll do a little bit of overdrive to finish these callers with Alan want
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:32.740]  You know the caller asks. How do we have hope look you're in this situation and so even though it's overwhelming and scientific
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:35.260]  And been very well calculated
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:37.140]  You now know about it
[02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:41.100]  And so I think the most important thing is to fully wake up out of the trance
[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:46.160]  That we have been inserted in a planned economy a more and more planned habitat
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:53.440]  They're trying to force us into artificial habitats controlled compact cities. I live in the country Alan lives in the country
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:58.760]  That's the first instinct and to try to get to know locals who you can trust to work together
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:03.500]  to move forward and expose the people that it's it's
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:09.360]  Beyond what you can even imagine when you first realize it and and and and how cold-blooded it is
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:12.160]  And I think the fact that the system so over-the-top
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:17.480]  They're able to hide in plain view, but that can also boomerang back against them Alan what?
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:21.480]  Yeah, I mean the ventral treated right down to the local county level
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:29.880]  There's organizations. I've mentioned them on the air to work where they graft themselves on to your local council
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:32.960]  They just turn up and graft themselves on cleaning their
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:36.880]  Environmentalists and that no one votes them in they're just there next thing
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:39.600]  You know they're writing the laws on what you can do on your land
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:44.440]  And they've got the money of the globalist and they are basically the red terror
[02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:51.640]  Vanguard investigation agents oh yes, and many of them are actually retired early retirement
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:59.280]  Bureaucrats, so this is where they go to given jobs and their full salaries and sell yourself down in a village here or a town there
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:02.600]  And start up a little oh, we've had that happen everywhere
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:07.080]  It's always a retired colonel or a required bureaucrat
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:12.520]  And they literally are spying and harassing everyone and then everybody kisses their hind end. I'll leave us alone
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:16.760]  We'll put you in power, and then they take over their parasites scum
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:22.760]  Yes, that's right, and so we've got to know who they are and their names are out there their organizations are out there
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:24.800]  But we're also into this age of technocracy
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:27.360]  understand
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:31.440]  The council on foreign relations to see the big branch that helps run the world
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:36.480]  At the day they said that they would build a structure around everybody's
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:40.920]  Constitution and which they have to bypass it all and overlapped it
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.920]  Yeah, they build these bureaucracies and then sign the authority over to that incrementally yes, and then the next step was to
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:55.600]  Do international treaties binding treaties that would bring them together take the new internet treaty couldn't get SOPA through just make it a treaty
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:01.720]  Make it a treaty and then of course they make supranational governmental bodies well no personal
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:08.720]  Individual has had a vote on the creation of the g20 for instance take the take the real euro bureaucracy
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:11.700]  They have a parliament, but it has no authority the bureaucrats run it
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:14.620]  Let's jam another call JT in Texas you're on the air with Alan Watt
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:21.320]  Boom he's gone Tara in Virginia. You're on the air. Can you hear me? Yes?
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:25.400]  I Alex hi Alan hi. I wanted to say
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:30.320]  I'm officially awake December 24th, so I'm on a real big learning curve I
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:37.160]  And I really enjoy everything that you talk about Alan. You're a great inspiration
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:43.780]  I've got an off-topic comment from your know me Prince interview yesterday
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:47.840]  You know the comment where she said that they're gonna start focusing on South America
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:52.400]  Mitt Romney was talking about that in a campaign speech yesterday in Florida
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:57.520]  And it just blew my mind how on spot. She was cheap and also
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:00.880]  That Chris Hedges interview was awesome
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:02.880]  And it goes a long way to try and bring
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:08.800]  Progressive over to listening to your to what you've got to say and getting over the whole conspiracy theory thing
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:10.760]  They have a hard time with that well
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:15.400]  It's a global corporate program, and it is a conspiracy and when we expose them
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:21.260]  They just say it's a theory, but there's no theory. It's just an open conspiracy. It is open. Yeah, it's open
[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:25.640]  It's taught in schools now that the world that they're told in the youngsters are at the five years of age
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:28.200]  They're told what kind of world that are going to grow up in
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:35.500]  Interdependence yeah, and then they got fake environmentalists to cover up the real environmental degradation. We're not saying environmentalists are bad period

[03:01:09.220 --> 03:01:14.460]  You won't be able to live without them. That's why Forbes said why is there a war against lemonade stands?
[03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:18.380]  Why is there a war against people selling pecans because it's all getting shut down
[03:01:18.380 --> 03:01:24.260]  And I watch people in public places when cops are bugging their eyes out or security guards the people get off on
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:27.260]  Graveling and the cops get off on it, and it's just pathetic
[03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:31.900]  This isn't America. This isn't England. This isn't Europe. This isn't anywhere
[03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:36.940]  Yeah, and plus because we live in an era of electronic
[03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:40.300]  media basically and
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:44.460]  incredible amounts of entertainment science fiction so the general public
[03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:48.660]  Everything's a blur to them when they come home from night. They just sit there and
[03:01:49.780 --> 03:01:55.380]  People all the time say I like your show, but you got this from this movie, and I'm like no that movie is
[03:01:55.940 --> 03:01:57.260]  fictionalizing what's really happening
[03:01:57.260 --> 03:02:02.940]  So you can't differentiate all realizes is showing you what the next step so that it's familiar to you
[03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:06.020]  And you go along with it. Just like the people every science fiction movie
[03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:11.340]  I see now explains that you're not allowed to have children in the future a lot of special license absolutely
[03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:14.780]  the so many like that to hear that a
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:20.620]  Virus comes along and sterilizes all you know what Alan I meant to get into this with you, and it's so important
[03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:22.660]  We're going to have you back up very soon
[03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:28.020]  They're really hyping all these weaponized viruses. They've got now that they're saying are just going to get out on accident
[03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:29.780]  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
[03:02:29.780 --> 03:02:34.880]  They'll do it when it's necessary remember remember to rock a fella at the last lucky jeans club
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:40.920]  That meeting they had he says we've been doing a steady March for depopulation by
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:46.520]  Abortions and sterilization it says, but now we must go in to and ramp it up
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:50.320]  He says we've got to create massive massive death yeah, and by the way
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:55.040]  I have the article I meant to get to today London Times billionaire club and bid to curb over population
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:03:00.760]  Says they met in secret David Rockefeller Warren Buffett and others at the Rockefeller University
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:05.280]  To try to with Bill Gates to figure out ways to reduce population faster
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:08.640]  Did you know the London Times you can't find this they pulled it?
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:13.360]  Yeah, they don't want you know it because we're supposed to be told Bill Gates wants to help us
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:18.140]  Well, he's trying to help the people people in Africa not to get sick. He loves them
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:26.600]  Yeah, he likes him a lot too doesn't he well again Minova Kissinger said about them back in the 70s when he brought his bill
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:27.400]  out
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:33.640]  And about the dangers of the third world exploding in population memorandum 200. We got to kill him
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:36.000]  Yeah, that's right, and so they're going ahead with the whole agenda
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:40.600]  We're living everything we're living through right now as I say was put on the table and planned
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:46.560]  3040 but that's an ace in the hole the fact that the old timers warned about all this people thought oh
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:51.240]  That's a conspiracy and now it's happening light bulbs are going off everywhere and people are going wait a minute
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:54.600]  I was told exactly this was gonna happen 30 years ago. I
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:01.320]  I mean I think that that's our real ace in the hole Alan is that people would been there for so long exposing this
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:03.720]  That's right and again, too
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:08.840]  It's a matter of teaching the younger ones and understanding the other ones of a hard time
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:16.260]  With holding a concept for any length of time because their attention span has been brought down to such a minimalistic level
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:21.400]  So you have to find a way to get things across almost in bits and bytes, and we got to do it quick
[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:26.680]  You're right because they've reduced the language so far down as young people are either awake, or they can't speak yes
[03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:32.200]  Yes, and I could seen as trendy to not be able to talk now and they've been trained you see even from cartoons
[03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:35.320]  Three-second bites for promo from movements in a cartoon
[03:04:35.720 --> 03:04:41.280]  Otherwise the child who's in loses interest now have been trained that that's the way it is and that's where most the propaganda is is
[03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:48.640]  In TV cartoons and fiction that's where they're bombarding you sorry to the other callers from Canada cliff and dusting it to you next time
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:54.360]  That's it for this segment of the transmission Alan watt. Thank you so much my friend
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:58.480]  It's been a pleasure Alex all right been a pleasure having you on coming up force fluoridation
[03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:25.120]  fluoridation forced bone cancer
