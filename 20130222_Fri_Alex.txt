[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:41.120]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:41.120 --> 00:48.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't believe it's already Friday. And we're going to be here
[00:48.120 --> 00:56.840]  live for the next three hours on this 22nd day of February 2013. And I will attempt to
[00:56.840 --> 01:02.560]  be calm today and go over all of the off the charts news and information that we're going
[01:02.560 --> 01:04.040]  to be covering.
[01:04.040 --> 01:12.240]  Now, I told you this was coming, but now it's official. The ATF is just going to make rules
[01:12.240 --> 01:18.480]  outside of law to start banning semiautomatic firearms. And the federal government, without
[01:18.480 --> 01:26.840]  a judge or jury or even doctor's designation, is going to declare most vets mentally incompetent
[01:26.840 --> 01:34.160]  and mail you a letter. And one lawyer alone knows of hundreds of vets that are coming
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.520]  to him getting this letter.
[01:38.520 --> 01:45.260]  And so we're going to be going over this report that's up at infowars.com. Federal government
[01:45.260 --> 01:52.760]  moves to disarm veterans. And Kurt Nemo has added the Department of Veterans Affairs official
[01:52.760 --> 02:00.480]  letter. That states a determination of incompetency will prohibit you from purchasing, possessing,
[02:00.480 --> 02:03.080]  receiving or transporting a firearm or ammunition.
[02:03.080 --> 02:07.980]  If you knowingly violate any of these prohibitions, you may be fined, imprisoned, or both pursuant
[02:07.980 --> 02:15.840]  to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Public document number 103-159 as implemented
[02:15.840 --> 02:30.960]  in 18 United States Code 924A2. And drugsreport.com has the original story on this with a breakdown
[02:30.960 --> 02:32.480]  report.
[02:32.480 --> 02:41.480]  Feds send letters to vets from VA prohibiting ownership or purchase of firearms or even
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.200]  shooting them. And they have the area excised and it's from a lawyer at Red Flag News. Now,
[02:47.200 --> 02:53.600]  I'm already aware of this information so I can confirm this is going on, but it's intensifying.
[02:53.600 --> 02:59.240]  Clinton when he left office tried this. About 89,000 vets just suddenly were told they couldn't
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.260]  own guns anymore, but it became a big court issue and they had to back off.
[03:03.260 --> 03:09.980]  This is dwarfing that right now. And this isn't where a court finds you incompetent
[03:09.980 --> 03:15.040]  and so you're put in the nut house. You're in the nut house now, you're in the nut house
[03:15.040 --> 03:22.160]  now. And I'm gonna take off on the Johnny Cash song, you're in the jailhouse now. And
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.360]  this is just completely arbitrary, it's what the Soviets did.
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.480]  It's what so many historians have pointed out and talked about, about tyranny coming
[03:31.480 --> 03:38.700]  in a medical form. And not that this globalism is so much a Soviet system, they use Soviet
[03:38.700 --> 03:46.040]  models of control and Soviet collectivism at the grassroots to control and redistribute
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.040]  wealth.
[03:47.040 --> 03:54.560]  But then it's done in a fascist way, as it always is, only redistributed to key select
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.720]  combines for political control. And then you have the globalist offshore who are exempt
[03:58.720 --> 04:05.240]  from all that. Pretty devastating info. The reason the Kurt Nemo article is important,
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.400]  this is originally in red flag news and the gateway pundit.com via drudgereport.com.
[04:10.400 --> 04:19.160]  The reason this is so important is that we've been on this for 17 years, but hardcore for
[04:19.160 --> 04:27.120]  11 plus. That it's not al-Qaeda that Homeland Security is for, it's for gut owners, conservatives,
[04:27.120 --> 04:34.020]  libertarians, constitutionalist, you name it. And that the liberals have all this liberal
[04:34.020 --> 04:39.400]  talk on the surface, a lot of which I actually agree with, but they don't follow through
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.400]  with it.
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.240]  It's all oppressive. They're the real authoritarians. They are the authoritarians. They say a lot
[04:46.240 --> 04:52.560]  of great stuff about equality and the rest of it, but it's all talk. It's camouflage.
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.060]  They are the most dangerous authoritarian party. And the Republicans are their kiss
[04:56.060 --> 05:00.840]  and cousins at the leadership level. We'll be right back with this incredible news.
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.560]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.320]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When

[07:04.440 --> 07:09.360]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[07:09.360 --> 07:14.600]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as
[07:14.600 --> 07:20.000]  one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.800]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes
[07:25.800 --> 07:30.560]  how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.160]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[07:35.160 --> 07:40.720]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.680]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[07:45.680 --> 07:51.800]  of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[08:03.200 --> 08:10.000]  I was trained in firearms. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody
[08:10.000 --> 08:18.960]  was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me. If I could have gotten
[08:18.960 --> 08:26.200]  51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one
[08:26.200 --> 08:34.000]  of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it. Defending the republic
[08:34.000 --> 08:44.000]  from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[08:44.000 --> 08:53.200]  It's all happening day by day, grain by grain, the hourglass runs dry, our liberties spilling
[08:53.200 --> 09:03.960]  into the dark void of tyranny. It is Friday, the 22nd day of February, 2013, and we see
[09:03.960 --> 09:10.720]  stand here at a crossroads in a conundrum in a paradox. Never have there been more people
[09:10.720 --> 09:13.040]  awake worldwide to tyranny.
[09:13.040 --> 09:17.420]  The Council on Foreign Relations bemoans that. Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the top global
[09:17.420 --> 09:24.840]  tacticians bemoans that. But also never before has there been greater technological systems
[09:24.840 --> 09:30.820]  of domination, surveillance and social control pointed at free humanity. And never have we
[09:30.820 --> 09:42.960]  had a more decentralized tyranny that basically load balances in a plausible deniability algorithm
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.080]  to where it's very hard to cut a hydra's head off.
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.600]  Because these globalists couch all their policies and rules and laws and frauds in different
[09:53.600 --> 10:02.120]  committees and waivers and certifications so that the bureaucracy is so deep that no
[10:02.120 --> 10:08.240]  one can ever point a finger at just one person. And that's why the tyrants can get away with
[10:08.240 --> 10:13.640]  so much. There have been many cases in history where you have an oligarchy, a small ruling
[10:13.640 --> 10:17.680]  elite or a royal dynasty or one emperor for that matter.
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.960]  And they will actually be egomaniacs who want big public work projects and aqueducts
[10:22.960 --> 10:27.680]  and want the population educated so they can dominate their neighbors and have a better
[10:27.680 --> 10:37.280]  military and a better economic system. Domination through trade. You've heard of the philosopher
[10:37.280 --> 10:51.040]  king, you can actually get golden ages out of the benevolent dictator.
[10:51.040 --> 11:00.880]  The problem is those are very rare, A, and B, once the centralization is set up, you
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.280]  can be assured that when that emperor is killed or that emperor dies, you're going to get
[11:06.280 --> 11:12.680]  a psychopathic demon in their place. Or maybe just somebody who's a little bit of a tyrant.
[11:12.680 --> 11:19.900]  But down the road, you will get a absolute out of control, psychopathic control freak
[11:19.900 --> 11:30.720]  in there, and then all hell will be released. I've studied the psychopathic mindset and
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.440]  the different dictatorial mindsets, the different variants throughout history.
[11:34.440 --> 11:37.960]  A, because I want to understand the present. To know the present, you have to know the
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.080]  past. To know the future, you need to know the past and the present. That's all important.
[11:43.080 --> 11:46.520]  That's what the globalists obsess on all day. That's what their Google and NSA spying is
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.800]  all about. It's what all their smart houses and smart meters and all these surveillance
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.280]  bots hiding in plain view in our homes are doing.
[11:54.280 --> 12:04.040]  But again, they lack the general, deeper, loving, kind-eyed, kind-souled understanding
[12:04.040 --> 12:12.440]  of their own human nature to be able to wield this power. And they are arrogant and they
[12:12.440 --> 12:19.600]  are basically like a diver who goes down below 150 feet, starts getting, what is it, the
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.080]  nitrogen psychosis.
[12:23.080 --> 12:29.560]  And starts getting higher than a kite and feeling incredibly confident. And then you
[12:29.560 --> 12:33.520]  swim into that old wreck, even though you're almost out of oxygen, feeling confident, you
[12:33.520 --> 12:42.040]  get caught up. It cuts your air hose and you drowned. And tyrants up in those upper latitudes
[12:42.040 --> 12:50.240]  of power, if they're narcissists slash sadists, control freaks, or whatever variant of that,
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.920]  they get the opposite of the megalomania up top.
[12:54.920 --> 13:02.960]  And then start hating everyone below them and engaging in absolute oppression and domination.
[13:02.960 --> 13:08.200]  And anything left standing has to be pulled down because it's a threat to them. Yertle
[13:08.200 --> 13:14.320]  the Turtle has to be up on top. And so higher, higher, build me up higher. I have to be higher
[13:14.320 --> 13:20.800]  than the birds, I have to be higher than the clouds, I have to be higher than the sun.
[13:20.800 --> 13:27.560]  The old story of Yertle the Turtle, Dr. Seuss. And here we are at that point. There is no
[13:27.560 --> 13:36.760]  doubt that the establishment has decided to go the way of premeditated oppression. The
[13:36.760 --> 13:42.300]  Republicans have been told, get in line. They're running the hoax that the Realty Party, not
[13:42.300 --> 13:44.780]  the neo-con variant, has been discredited.
[13:44.780 --> 13:49.160]  Because even though it's not perfect, it holds the seeds of the Republic, private property,
[13:49.160 --> 13:55.600]  the family, Second Amendment, right to life, things like that in its guts. And so it must
[13:55.600 --> 14:00.600]  be destroyed. And so they're running the hoax that the states are discredited and there's
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.400]  no rights there. And there's no rights in the individuals and gun owners are collectively
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.160]  guilty for the violence in Mexico, even though our government helped set that up with Fast
[14:10.160 --> 14:11.160]  and Furious.
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.960]  And we're guilty for Sandy Hook and we're collectively terrorist and we're collectively
[14:14.960 --> 14:23.760]  bad. And racial division, creating a race connection. If you don't like socialist healthcare
[14:23.760 --> 14:29.280]  written by the insurance companies to bankrupt the country and consolidate power. Completely
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.080]  fascist but they sell it as some socialist freebie.
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.840]  Now you must be racist then, you're like, what does that have to do with common sense?
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.560]  It's a non-starter, it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense. Because everything is
[14:42.560 --> 14:53.360]  debased down to a bunch of bleeding and shouting. Or emails and comments I see going, I like
[14:53.360 --> 14:59.280]  Newt Gingrich, that's a real conservative. They don't know he's a globalist picked as
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.580]  a university professor cuz he wrote publications calling for world government.
[15:03.580 --> 15:07.920]  Calling for a one world planetary regime, hanging out at Bilderberg group meetings and
[15:07.920 --> 15:14.120]  stuff, they don't know. And I listen to talk radio callers on other shows, they're so helpless
[15:14.120 --> 15:20.680]  most of them. And that's a more informed group on average, they have no idea. It just doesn't
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.040]  make sense, the government shouldn't raise taxes, the government shouldn't do that.
[15:26.040 --> 15:34.160]  It's gonna make the economy shut down, they're so stupid. They're not stupid ladies and gentlemen,
[15:34.160 --> 15:41.880]  they are financially debasing you. Now here's the deal, I'm gonna be getting into the economy,
[15:41.880 --> 15:46.200]  I've got to today, it's so important, covered it some yesterday but not one-tenth of what
[15:46.200 --> 15:47.200]  I should.
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.880]  A bunch of medical news, now people are finally listening about MSG, doesn't just make you
[15:51.880 --> 15:57.400]  sick, it brain damages you, okay? Don't eat MSG, we've got to eradicate it. Aspartame
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.880]  now it's coming out, it's giving people type 2 diabetes. As I told you 17 years ago, they
[16:02.880 --> 16:08.320]  knew day one, they couldn't get it approved in the 60s and 70s folks, it killed the monkeys
[16:08.320 --> 16:13.180]  they fed it to, killed them, go look it up.
[16:13.180 --> 16:17.660]  That's finally in CBS news and finally, but they're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[16:17.660 --> 16:22.960]  on purpose, remember. But even if people are weak minded and can't admit that cuz that's
[16:22.960 --> 16:30.280]  scary, even if you deny it, it's still going on. The point is it's hurting you, so we've
[16:30.280 --> 16:31.320]  got some news on that.
[16:31.320 --> 16:35.040]  The shocking truth about organic foods grown in the world's worst environmental cesspool
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.900]  China being flown in, it's not just horse meat. Horse meat, it's what's for dinner,
[16:40.900 --> 16:47.600]  it's not just fake fish, chicken they texturize and put chemicals in to give it a fishy taste
[16:47.600 --> 16:52.920]  and they put it through different machinery and re-cost it to look like fish, extruding
[16:52.920 --> 16:59.000]  it out of molds, they do it with pork.
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.880]  All this is coming out that the food's fake, the water's fake, fake, fake, fake, that's
[17:03.880 --> 17:12.160]  part of living under a tyranny. And it's part of living in a society where there's no lying
[17:12.160 --> 17:19.240]  going on or I don't care if the government lies to me. Well, when you don't care if the
[17:19.240 --> 17:24.600]  government's lying to you, or if you don't care if corporations are lying to you, and
[17:24.600 --> 17:32.040]  if you just kinda unplug from reality and just go with it, very bad things happen.
[17:32.040 --> 17:40.920]  See, everybody's been taught it's an attribute to be silly, to be foolish, to not care, to
[17:40.920 --> 17:47.800]  say to hell with it, but it's not, ladies and gentlemen, it just makes things worse.
[17:47.800 --> 17:55.760]  Now that said, I'm gonna cover our top story when it ties into the other Second Amendment
[17:55.760 --> 18:01.240]  news and the TSA news on the other side of this break. And I knew this was already being
[18:01.240 --> 18:08.800]  tested, I knew this was coming, but it really freaks me out because it's so over the top
[18:08.800 --> 18:15.760]  brazen. And I want you to call all your friends and family, whether they have an iPhone, they
[18:15.760 --> 18:17.960]  can go download the free iPhone app.
[18:17.960 --> 18:25.220]  It's linked to mfallwars.com or prisonplanet.com in the listen page area, or just Google free
[18:25.220 --> 18:29.760]  mfallwars iPhone app, or there's a free Android apps, all of them. Or you can listen on your
[18:29.760 --> 18:40.700]  local AM or FM station, XM 166 picks up the second and third hour. But tell your friends
[18:40.700 --> 18:43.840]  and family to tune in right now.
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.540]  Tell them to tune in right now, email them, call them, tell your co-workers if you're
[18:48.540 --> 18:55.380]  on lunch, you need to hear this. Because the system plans on just putting this out there,
[18:55.380 --> 18:59.600]  and maybe they have a congressional hearing and then debate it, and then nothing happens.
[18:59.600 --> 19:08.320]  This is the end of due process. It's really a cherry on top of everything. And it confirms
[19:08.320 --> 19:12.720]  everything else, all the documents, all the training manuals, all my law enforcement sources
[19:12.720 --> 19:21.760]  in FBI, in ATF, in federal marshals, in state police, in local police.
[19:21.760 --> 19:26.560]  I told you years ago they're trying to confiscate veterans guns in mass. I told you years ago
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.640]  they're gonna send a letter to veterans saying come turn your guns in. They're gonna tell
[19:31.640 --> 19:35.640]  generals to turn their guns in, just like the Soviets did. They'd only captured part
[19:35.640 --> 19:40.640]  of Moscow, they ordered the military to turn their guns in, and they did it. They promised
[19:40.640 --> 19:41.640]  an amnesty if they did.
[19:41.640 --> 19:46.800]  I mean, this has happened everywhere else, and we just can't believe it's happening here.
[19:46.800 --> 19:52.320]  They really are gonna have a hot coup takeover, a purge, a mass arrest. They really are planning
[19:52.320 --> 19:56.800]  that, okay? That's not rhetoric. We've gotta defend the Republic, we've gotta defeat these
[19:56.800 --> 20:00.640]  globalist tyrants. We'll be right back, stay with us.

[22:33.460 --> 22:38.560]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[22:38.560 --> 22:43.240]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet

[23:09.200 --> 23:13.400]  family and his friends and his patients. My dad was a family physician, he was a medical
[23:13.400 --> 23:14.200]  doctor.
[23:14.200 --> 23:19.120]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone. Amazing product, amazing results.
[23:19.120 --> 23:25.000]  Like an amazing thing, having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.360]  the Carnivora that did it.
[23:26.360 --> 23:32.840]  And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.

[23:58.520 --> 24:20.040]  Okay, let me get into our top stories, ladies and gentlemen. First off, federal government
[24:20.040 --> 24:25.280]  moves to disarm veterans. No judge, no jury. They just say, well, you're a combat vet.
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.800]  You're not allowed to have guns anymore. We can't trust you, cuz it's a foreign takeover.
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.780]  We have the official Department of Veterans Affairs saying, here is your letter. You can't
[24:33.780 --> 24:39.300]  own guns anymore. No judge, no jury. It's like a no-fly list. As Rahm Emanuel said back
[24:39.300 --> 24:43.180]  when he was White House Chief of Staff, he said, we're just gonna put you on a no gun
[24:43.180 --> 24:48.240]  buy list, whoever we want, because we think maybe you might be a possible terrorist.
[24:48.240 --> 24:53.520]  We're gonna be going over that, going over the actual documents that we have linked up
[24:53.520 --> 24:58.480]  at infowars.com, where it's all broken down. We're gonna get the constitutional lawyer
[24:58.480 --> 25:08.000]  on who's representing these clients. So that is all coming up. Sincerely yours, Kay Kalama,
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.640]  Veterans Service Center, Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs. That's just this letter.
[25:12.640 --> 25:18.320]  No judge, no jury, no nothing. It's kinda like when LA sends me a bill for $1,200 saying,
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.320]  somebody put it infowars.com, sign up. And so you owe us this or we're gonna arrest you.
[25:23.320 --> 25:29.240]  No citation, no judge, no jury, no statutory law. Just we have men with guns. We will sue
[25:29.240 --> 25:35.040]  you. We will put a warrant out and Texas reciprocates. They are going to arrest you. The state police
[25:35.040 --> 25:42.120]  are going to arrest you. $1,200 scum. Veterans, there is no law. We are red codes. We're coming
[25:42.120 --> 25:44.280]  for your guns.
[25:44.280 --> 25:48.440]  We have SWAT teams ready. Of course, they'll take their guns later too, but they'll love
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.960]  it. I mean, the vets don't turn their guns and they'll burn them up like Dorner. Federal
[25:52.960 --> 25:59.520]  government moves to disarm veterans, boom. DHS contractor apologizes for selling shooting
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.520]  targets of children. Now, we put it out. We put the story out. We broke it on Monday.
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.640]  People couldn't believe it. The company responded. DHS spent 2 million requesting targets of
[26:09.640 --> 26:15.240]  children to shoot and pregnant women. And now they've responded apologizing saying they
[26:15.240 --> 26:20.800]  won't sell them to the public anymore. That was their mistake. They were supposed to just
[26:20.800 --> 26:26.800]  sell those to DHS and keep that training with the 2 billion bullets quiet.
[26:26.800 --> 26:32.480]  So that's now official. And Michael Moore, who has bodyguards that I've personally been
[26:32.480 --> 26:38.440]  shoved around by for no reason, tried to ask him a question in the New York streets politely.
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.880]  You could see they all had bulges under their jackets carrying firearms. His bodyguards
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.020]  have been arrested before carrying firearms in illegal areas like the airport. But he
[26:49.020 --> 26:53.800]  has guns, by the way, and he has bodyguards. He says, you, we have the video, he says get
[26:53.800 --> 27:01.800]  a dog. You're not worth $80 million like Michael Moore or my old friend Charlie Sheen, who's
[27:01.800 --> 27:08.560]  being politically correct now, I guess, saying, well, I've got bodyguards, so you don't need
[27:08.560 --> 27:09.560]  a gun.
[27:09.560 --> 27:17.400]  Well, Charlie, we don't all make $3 million a week like you. We don't all own a block
[27:17.400 --> 27:24.320]  of the Hollywood Hills. What, four houses on the same block, bro? Here, let's go over
[27:24.320 --> 27:31.480]  to this giant palace house with swimming pools, and it's the disconnect, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:31.480 --> 27:41.080]  And I'm not, I like Charlie, I've known him a long time. I can't even bring myself to
[27:41.080 --> 27:48.320]  call him and criticize him. I don't even know what to do anymore, I gotta call him.
[27:48.320 --> 27:51.320]  Speaking of talking to people, I'm gonna come back in a longer segment and get into the
[27:51.320 --> 27:58.920]  magnitude of the officially, no judge, no jury, no designation, no nothing. Mainly how
[27:58.920 --> 28:02.080]  they're doing is you go into the VA and they ask you, how you feeling, Bob?
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.720]  Been a little angry lately after you had to have that leg amputated as a diabetes? Yeah,
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.240]  that's really making me angry. Okay, have fun going home. And you get home and the CPS
[28:12.240 --> 28:18.160]  is taking your kids and your guns have been taken forever. Yeah, they're not just gonna
[28:18.160 --> 28:20.440]  take your guns, they're gonna take your kids, I forgot that part.
[28:20.440 --> 28:25.920]  That's all over the news. They even have veterans organizations now. Yeah, you go watch Zero
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.480]  Dark Thirty and it's all the Navy SEALs and they're real men and we're gonna be replaced
[28:30.480 --> 28:39.280]  with robots very soon. The Air Force already is. That's how much the system loves the troops.
[28:39.280 --> 28:45.920]  They hate you. Let me show some TV viewers this card. Rob Jacobson gave this to me for
[28:45.920 --> 28:48.440]  my birthday on February 11th as a joke.
[28:48.440 --> 28:54.320]  It's Bill and Hillary Clinton. And that's back when they were CIA operatives in the
[28:54.320 --> 28:59.600]  late 60s. And they were over in London under a famous CIA section chief. Yeah, they're
[28:59.600 --> 29:05.680]  CIA just like Anderson Cooper. And when you're CIA, that's foreign banks that took over through
[29:05.680 --> 29:14.300]  skull and bones that founded the CIA under OSS in 41 and the CIA in 47. This is the foreign
[29:14.300 --> 29:15.380]  takeover group.
[29:15.380 --> 29:19.640]  This is the monopoly group and this is who rules us. These are the people that run our
[29:19.640 --> 29:26.520]  country today. About as high as it gets are Hillary and Clinton as top level minions of
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.360]  the actual owners. And look at them, I wanna show people this. This is who we're gonna
[29:30.360 --> 29:35.040]  bow to. We're gonna take forced inoculations cuz they say. We're gonna turn our guns in
[29:35.040 --> 29:36.040]  cuz we say.
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.080]  And they're gonna take the veterans kids cuz they say. And they're gonna put us in reeducation
[29:40.080 --> 29:43.960]  camps cuz they say. And look how weak and pathetic they are. But because they're weak
[29:43.960 --> 29:49.920]  and pathetic laughing at us, we'll let them run our lives because we love to be slaves.
[29:49.920 --> 30:01.120]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.120 --> 30:05.300]  Your freedoms are on the line. The second amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[30:05.300 --> 30:10.160]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[30:10.160 --> 30:16.040]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[30:16.040 --> 30:20.400]  All governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[30:20.400 --> 30:24.880]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you
[30:24.880 --> 30:30.080]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[33:00.940 --> 33:04.380]  You've heard it here. I'm on television so everybody knows it. I believe in the Second
[33:04.380 --> 33:08.420]  Amendment. I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[33:08.420 --> 33:14.860]  We're going to find the people who are doing this, take them out and shoot them. You take
[33:14.860 --> 33:19.900]  them out, they are traitors of this country and shoot them. Shoot them dead. I'll pay
[33:19.900 --> 33:24.700]  for the bullet. Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic
[33:24.700 --> 33:35.580]  that you got in Glee Goys and pop them. I'd love to see that. In uniform.
[33:35.580 --> 33:43.380]  I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I won't take your
[33:43.380 --> 33:54.980]  gun away. Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[33:54.980 --> 34:02.340]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live and we have a lot of new listeners today. Let
[34:02.340 --> 34:07.100]  me explain what's happened. Foreign mega banks have taken over most of the world because
[34:07.100 --> 34:13.100]  they can issue unlimited currency and credit and then pay our governments off to sign on
[34:13.100 --> 34:19.500]  to that fraudulent derivative debt. Because that fake paper, once it's invested and once
[34:19.500 --> 34:26.060]  it infects the 401ks, the pension funds, the bond markets, now is basically holding us
[34:26.060 --> 34:27.900]  all hostage.
[34:27.900 --> 34:34.740]  And this is how they're consolidating the economy into a top-down, organized, managed
[34:34.740 --> 34:42.200]  command and control system. And they have basically hobbled the public's mind by only
[34:42.200 --> 34:48.300]  teaching you about leftism and right-wingism or fascism on the right, communism on the
[34:48.300 --> 34:53.780]  left. And which you know fascism always becomes authoritarian, communism becomes authoritarian
[34:53.780 --> 35:00.480]  because they're authoritarian systems designed by the robber barons starting in the 1870s
[35:00.480 --> 35:01.480]  on record.
[35:01.480 --> 35:07.100]  I mean, they've had the congressional hearings on this. There have been countless white papers
[35:07.100 --> 35:13.460]  and books written by Helmut Schmidt, Men in Powers, a political retrospective, Carol Quigley's
[35:13.460 --> 35:17.460]  Tragedy and Hope. I don't know, four or five books, I've read three of them by Zbigniew
[35:17.460 --> 35:24.940]  Brzezinski, all of it. And they sell it to every audience, they sell it to libertarians
[35:24.940 --> 35:26.980]  one way, they're Peter Thiel.
[35:26.980 --> 35:30.380]  They sell it to liberals another way, they sell it to right-wingers another way. But
[35:30.380 --> 35:36.620]  really it's all the same poison labeled with different flavors. It's grape, it's cherry,
[35:36.620 --> 35:43.100]  it's coconut, it's strawberry, it's orange, it's lime, it's lemon lime. It's all those
[35:43.100 --> 35:49.540]  flavors, it's raspberry Kool-Aid, but it's all the same base poison cyanide.
[35:49.540 --> 35:53.220]  Jim Jones handed out a bunch of different flavors there in Guyana, but it was all the
[35:53.220 --> 36:00.340]  same thing at the rock bottom, at the rock bottom. And they are trying to create literally
[36:00.340 --> 36:05.300]  a false political reality with a dumbed down population so that the globalists, let's look
[36:05.300 --> 36:11.780]  at motive, get the life extension technologies and can have their progeny enjoy the resources
[36:11.780 --> 36:15.700]  of the Earth and the advanced human development for themselves.
[36:15.700 --> 36:22.920]  It is the ultimate act of total domination. The culmination of British royalty funding
[36:22.920 --> 36:30.420]  scientists in the 1850s beginning for a political system of total control to end the species
[36:30.420 --> 36:38.500]  as it has been known to artificialize it, to hobble it, to binary damage it with a poison
[36:38.500 --> 36:44.460]  in the culture of artificial degeneration so that the power structure has to be the
[36:44.460 --> 36:53.020]  artificial gravitational girder or center of the wheel system to unify and control it.
[36:53.020 --> 36:58.380]  Everything is about making us dependent on them, getting us in the judicial system, getting
[36:58.380 --> 37:02.980]  us in the psychiatric system, getting us into the criminal justice system, getting us into
[37:02.980 --> 37:09.860]  the fraternity, into the cult, into the guild, into the right wing and the liberal, the gay,
[37:09.860 --> 37:16.100]  the straight, the black, the white, the raza, the matcha, the clan.
[37:16.100 --> 37:21.060]  Getting you into your group then with key globalist over it at each point in Rothkop
[37:21.060 --> 37:25.580]  and the Kissinger groups superclass model. I had Rothkop head of the Kissinger group
[37:25.580 --> 37:29.940]  at the time who wrote superclass five years ago. I talk about it so much because I'm like,
[37:29.940 --> 37:32.820]  why did you come on the show when I saw your book in the Washington Post?
[37:32.820 --> 37:37.820]  He goes, well, I know it's a good size show. And I said, did you think I was Alex S. Jones,
[37:37.820 --> 37:41.020]  the head of the Shorenstein Center and the former head of the New York Times? He goes,
[37:41.020 --> 37:45.520]  no, I knew you were Alex E. Jones. He goes, I wanted to have you on and try to convince
[37:45.520 --> 37:51.380]  you globalism is good. I was talking to him during the few breaks. He was on for 30 minutes,
[37:51.380 --> 37:52.380]  maybe it was an hour.
[37:52.380 --> 37:56.420]  You can go pull up that interview out there. And after that, we've called him. He said,
[37:56.420 --> 38:00.940]  no, I couldn't convince you. You don't understand. I don't want to come back on. I'm too busy.
[38:00.940 --> 38:04.580]  But during the breaks, he's like, well, you're part of the superclass. You're like a leader
[38:04.580 --> 38:09.960]  of the Patriots. I mean, that's how this works. I was like, oh, I can still be a patriot and
[38:09.960 --> 38:13.340]  be Mr. Libertarian, but then I can kind of do a little favors.
[38:13.340 --> 38:18.860]  He's like, well, that's not how it works. This is during the break talking to him, but
[38:18.860 --> 38:25.860]  he's like, it's not as bad as you say. It's the way it's always been. It's no big deal.
[38:25.860 --> 38:33.260]  It's warm inside. Come on inside, Alex. But see, that's only the cover story, folks. It's
[38:33.260 --> 38:36.900]  very dark on the inside of this thing.
[38:36.900 --> 38:44.080]  And I'm not bragging about myself. I'm not bragging about Alex Jones here. I'm saying
[38:44.080 --> 38:48.340]  that I've had top national radio executives try to get me to sell out to the New World
[38:48.340 --> 38:53.140]  Order. And it's the same thing. Globalism's the future. You can't stop it, Alex. You're
[38:53.140 --> 38:55.700]  gonna be a star or be on this crusade and go nowhere.
[38:55.700 --> 39:01.100]  I've been giving that speech like four times by four different radio executives. Rothkop
[39:01.100 --> 39:09.340]  was giving me the speech during three minute breaks. Don't you understand, folks? This
[39:09.340 --> 39:16.340]  is not my opinion about this New World Order. But I'll tell you what I found. When everybody
[39:16.340 --> 39:19.180]  sold out, and I never did this on purpose.
[39:19.180 --> 39:25.740]  But when everybody sold out, it's lesser and lesser returns to sell out. I never sold out
[39:25.740 --> 39:29.620]  because I'm not signing on to corruption and evil and death instruction. I have goodwill
[39:29.620 --> 39:33.860]  for people. But I'll use an analogy that I've read in the Wall Street Journal and other
[39:33.860 --> 39:35.780]  places about porn.
[39:35.780 --> 39:40.700]  30 years ago, a top porn actress might get paid two, $3 million a year, half a million
[39:40.700 --> 39:46.460]  dollars per picture. Now, the quality of women is off the charts, supermodel level, and they're
[39:46.460 --> 39:52.320]  getting paid $500. Because there's such a glut, every young woman wants to be a star.
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.260]  The only place you get called a star, a mind control event. You're a star being a cop.
[39:57.260 --> 40:01.460]  You're a star being a bureaucrat. You're a star when you're the manager at McDonald's.
[40:01.460 --> 40:07.820]  You have power, like a TSA says, I have power, I have power. Now the women are paid $500,
[40:07.820 --> 40:15.980]  top stars $2,000, $3,000. And they've got to do more and more horrible things.
[40:15.980 --> 40:20.260]  And I've read where the porn directors and people brag, it's been my mission to destroy
[40:20.260 --> 40:27.900]  society and Christianity. And of course, they're just cogs too. The top scientific technocrats,
[40:27.900 --> 40:32.660]  they've got their God, they've got what they believe in. But it's about debasing you so
[40:32.660 --> 40:37.780]  you have no human empathy, so that when you're being abused next, your neighbors won't help
[40:37.780 --> 40:38.780]  you.
[40:38.780 --> 40:42.660]  Because they've lost their empathy. In fact, I'm gonna get to the top story here in a moment.
[40:42.660 --> 40:52.000]  But yesterday I was driving home, and I never do this. And I said, you know what? I'm gonna
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.600]  turn down this street, and I'm gonna go to this movie theater. And I bet there is a zero
[40:58.600 --> 41:01.460]  dark 30 showing in ten minutes.
[41:01.460 --> 41:07.700]  And I didn't really know movie show times, cuz I went home early yesterday at about three
[41:07.700 --> 41:12.180]  o'clock. My kids weren't gonna be home till about six, so I thought, you know what? If
[41:12.180 --> 41:18.060]  it's showing right at three, three ten, I'll see it. I pull in, three ten, walk in, it
[41:18.060 --> 41:22.620]  starts, two and a half hour movie.
[41:22.620 --> 41:26.580]  And I just knew what the whole thing was gonna be. It was a giant torture porn event with
[41:26.580 --> 41:32.380]  powerful sexy women doing the torturing. And it's so powerful, the CIA is so cool, and
[41:32.380 --> 41:36.980]  they're such great people. And they're so good, and they're so nice. Folks, they run
[41:36.980 --> 41:39.780]  the giant child kidnapping rings.
[41:39.780 --> 41:44.860]  They run the narcotics. And I don't just need the Solicitor General's hearings in 97 where
[41:44.860 --> 41:51.020]  they confirm they run most of the narcotics. Or that the CIA protects the groups that run
[41:51.020 --> 41:55.140]  the snuff films and all of it. And Brzezinski's argument in one of his books, he says, yeah,
[41:55.140 --> 41:56.740]  we control organized crime.
[41:56.740 --> 42:03.740]  What was it, the Technotronic Age, I believe. Wrote that in the 70s. He goes, yeah, well,
[42:03.740 --> 42:09.580]  yeah, the intelligence agencies, Interpol in Europe, CIA here, we do control the organized
[42:09.580 --> 42:15.060]  crime and all the vices. Because then we can control it and limit it by controlling it,
[42:15.060 --> 42:16.060]  cuz it'll always be there.
[42:16.060 --> 42:20.740]  It's like a fake libertarian Rand Corporation statement. Hey, it isn't your libertarian
[42:20.740 --> 42:25.140]  technotronic right to grab five year olds out of backyards, torture them, rape them
[42:25.140 --> 42:31.740]  for six months and blow their heads off. Cuz you're into that. And then all their movies
[42:31.740 --> 42:36.780]  now are about demons killing kids, and the kids kill their parents, and all the rest
[42:36.780 --> 42:37.780]  of it.
[42:37.780 --> 42:45.540]  And all this stuff, getting you ready for the real deal. Bathing you, waterboarding
[42:45.540 --> 42:50.220]  you in just Satanism. Just, yeah, we're torturing people's kids to keep you safe for 9-11, the
[42:50.220 --> 42:55.380]  whole movies. They killed 3,000 of our citizens, so we've gotta torture them. Of course, they
[42:55.380 --> 42:59.740]  didn't show the little kids being tortured, or how they got KSM to talk, and then confess
[42:59.740 --> 43:04.580]  the things he didn't do in the movie.
[43:04.580 --> 43:09.300]  As dog collars and people defecating on themselves, and I sat there and watched women in the audience,
[43:09.300 --> 43:14.460]  it was mainly women. Cuz it was a matinee, a late matinee, and it was about ten women
[43:14.460 --> 43:18.820]  in there and about five men. And I sat there, people watching, and watched the women getting
[43:18.820 --> 43:20.740]  upset and also feeling powerful.
[43:20.740 --> 43:26.820]  Ooh, look how they just tortured him, getting off on it. I mean, it's so sick how they're
[43:26.820 --> 43:34.140]  programming you. So this is not the CIA, this is foreign governments. And I don't even need
[43:34.140 --> 43:40.540]  to know all the congressional hearings and what's admitted and the army reports. Every
[43:40.540 --> 43:46.940]  person I know who was in the CIA in my extended family that I've talked to, and it's like,
[43:46.940 --> 43:47.940]  you have family in the CIA?
[43:47.940 --> 43:53.180]  Yeah, it's like saying I had family that worked for Frito-Lay. It's a gigantic operation,
[43:53.180 --> 43:58.020]  about 50 times bigger than you're even told it is. There's CIA in every neighborhood,
[43:58.020 --> 44:04.100]  it's nothing. It's not like some sex, it's like porn stars. They're nothing but whores
[44:04.100 --> 44:08.420]  on video, because there's a glut, it's nothing.
[44:08.420 --> 44:12.980]  And they recruit all these people that think they're rock stars. You go to Walmart or Target
[44:12.980 --> 44:17.300]  and half the toys for kids are how to spy on your parents and how to be a spy, priming
[44:17.300 --> 44:24.380]  them right out of high school. And they all just get off on how their secret agents, they're
[44:24.380 --> 44:25.620]  buying the whole thing.
[44:25.620 --> 44:35.140]  It's a joke, you're nobody, you're nobody, nobody, and nobody rides for free. You're
[44:35.140 --> 44:46.660]  not America, you're the sword going right in America's heart. And it was Churchill that
[44:46.660 --> 44:50.340]  said the truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies. That's another twisted way of saying
[44:50.340 --> 44:53.500]  we've got to be more evil than the evil guys to beat them.
[44:53.500 --> 44:58.540]  No, that's not how you beat evil. You have the moral high ground, you have the facts,
[44:58.540 --> 45:02.940]  and you work and build up society and create investment and give people their own money
[45:02.940 --> 45:08.980]  back and you take to the stars. That's what builds civilizations, not a bunch of sickos
[45:08.980 --> 45:11.580]  lying to the public and lying to themselves.
[45:11.580 --> 45:21.340]  I'm gonna do my review of the film. It's already out there online too. You can buy it online.
[45:21.340 --> 45:25.820]  I'm gonna have to watch it and take notes. It was so horrible. It was exactly what I
[45:25.820 --> 45:31.620]  knew it would be. Just a giant fable fiction. And I knew from the start at the end, she
[45:31.620 --> 45:35.980]  would be there when they got his body and I even saw her in a tent unzipping it cuz
[45:35.980 --> 45:38.140]  none of us were allowed to see bin Laden cuz it was all fake.
[45:38.140 --> 45:43.180]  Now they killed the seals that were involved, almost all of them. That didn't fit into the
[45:43.180 --> 45:48.500]  narrative like, Pat Tillman died charging the machine gun nest. Of course he did with
[45:48.500 --> 45:57.060]  the Easter Bunny. And I knew before it started, she at the end, it would be in the tent and
[45:57.060 --> 46:01.860]  that she would unzip it by herself and she would see bin Laden and then we would all
[46:01.860 --> 46:06.580]  have the collective event of seeing bin Laden.
[46:06.580 --> 46:11.860]  I remember how they put out all those fake bin Laden videos and photos of him dead. And
[46:11.860 --> 46:15.860]  we even went and found the original photos and showed it was fake. And then I'd talk
[46:15.860 --> 46:19.900]  to people who have like family and intelligence and stuff and they'd go, I'm not gonna show
[46:19.900 --> 46:21.140]  you the photo but it's real.
[46:21.140 --> 46:25.220]  We were shown it internally. And we're like, you don't have those clearances. You were
[46:25.220 --> 46:30.980]  sent it by some of your buddies at the different defense contractors. I won't say which one.
[46:30.980 --> 46:39.900]  And I said, is it this one? They're like, I'm not gonna talk about it. See, you were
[46:39.900 --> 46:42.740]  shown the real photo.
[46:42.740 --> 46:46.380]  And the weak minded public that thinks wrestling is real, they all went and a lot of them are
[46:46.380 --> 46:53.780]  gonna think that was real. Zero Dark Thirty, you saw bin Laden's body. And the woman goes
[46:53.780 --> 47:01.060]  and unzips it. And there it is. And it's so, so powerful and so wonderful. And all the
[47:01.060 --> 47:04.140]  hot blondes and redheads torturing people.
[47:04.140 --> 47:13.820]  Yeah, it's so powerful and they get the job done. And it's all this caddy fake trendy
[47:13.820 --> 47:19.460]  yuppie thing, all these fake mannerisms pre-programmed, all of it. I could just see the layers of
[47:19.460 --> 47:26.420]  psych warfare. Meanwhile, the guys up on top, they're in power cuz they like to watch snuff
[47:26.420 --> 47:28.060]  films of kids all day.
[47:28.060 --> 47:33.620]  All the big old ugly men that you bow down to and kiss their butt all day. All you women
[47:33.620 --> 47:39.820]  in the CIA wonder why none of them are interested in you. You've just signed on to pulling toddler's
[47:39.820 --> 47:47.980]  teeth out with pliers. You've just signed on to the coldest circle of hell, the night
[47:47.980 --> 47:48.980]  circle.
[47:48.980 --> 47:53.180]  And again, I'm not even demonizing the CIA cuz it's just a New World Order British banking
[47:53.180 --> 47:58.540]  intelligence. It's a private Rothschild intelligence basically, a Russell Trust intelligence, an
[47:58.540 --> 48:04.980]  Illuminati intelligence. On record, Illuminati founded Skull and Bones, 1832. Skull and Bones
[48:04.980 --> 48:10.740]  creates the core of the OSS US version for British implantation.
[48:10.740 --> 48:15.020]  The two penetrating each other, merging the houses. That's what Pratt House was meant
[48:15.020 --> 48:22.860]  to do. It is well set up in 1922 in New York. We are the British Empire. We are the New
[48:22.860 --> 48:27.300]  World Order and we pay for it and we get the blame for it and we get all of it. And then
[48:27.300 --> 48:31.300]  the good old boys sit around and go, yeah, we got them Arabs.
[48:31.300 --> 48:36.740]  We got them Arabs oil. We got them Arabs. And I'm like, hey, Bubba, what were you paying
[48:36.740 --> 48:45.500]  before the last Gulf War in 1991? What were you paying in the second big one in 2003?
[48:45.500 --> 48:52.900]  You're paying about $1, $25, $30, $40. You like paying four bucks a gallon? Saddam's
[48:52.900 --> 48:59.220]  crime was pumping too much oil to pay off his debts. His crime was wanting to have a
[48:59.220 --> 49:06.900]  sovereign country. His crime was being a CIA high level trainee to be a puppet of Iraq
[49:06.900 --> 49:11.760]  and kicking the CIA out and saying I'm the boss.
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.180]  His crime was putting women in college. His crime was playing rock and roll music on the
[49:17.180 --> 49:25.060]  radio. His crime was not being run by Saudi Arabia. And his crime was, again, the Iran-Iraq
[49:25.060 --> 49:29.280]  war. They ordered him to launch against Iran that killed several million Iranians and hundreds
[49:29.280 --> 49:30.740]  of thousands of Iraqis.
[49:30.740 --> 49:35.060]  That seven, eight, nine year war, that got him into $40 billion worth of debt. He was
[49:35.060 --> 49:38.780]  trying to pay it off. And they said, hey, Saddam, we want you to give them these vaccines.
[49:38.780 --> 49:44.420]  He said, I'm not gonna kill my people. I'm not gonna sterilize them. And they said, well,
[49:44.420 --> 49:47.140]  then die, punk.
[49:47.140 --> 49:52.140]  We took you when you were an army captain at age 20 and trained you for three years
[49:52.140 --> 49:57.900]  in Cairo for your job to break down that country and kill your people. And you're gonna do
[49:57.900 --> 50:06.140]  it or you're dead. Is that clear? And by the way, the goal they have for America is the
[50:06.140 --> 50:08.580]  exact same goal they have for those Iraqis.
[50:08.580 --> 50:13.120]  And that they've got for the Libyans, and they've got for the Syrians, and they've got
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.780]  for the American people. And they've got for the Canadians, and they've got for every African,
[50:18.780 --> 50:25.340]  every Latin American, every Asian, everybody on Earth is targeted by the new world order.
[50:25.340 --> 50:30.760]  And they are not going away. They are not standing down. They are not backing off. They
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.180]  are not quitting. And now they're getting ready to downsize the civilian force by a
[50:35.180 --> 50:36.180]  million plus.
[50:36.180 --> 50:40.540]  They're getting ready to downsize the armed forces by 200,000 at least. And they're going
[50:40.540 --> 50:45.260]  all robots and drones. And they're gonna list you as the enemies while praising you. That's
[50:45.260 --> 50:49.700]  a high level psych op. Veterans are God. Veterans are God. Veterans are the best hero ever.
[50:49.700 --> 50:53.580]  By the way, take their guns. They're the terrorists. Mow them down. You're like, I love the government.
[50:53.580 --> 50:58.460]  They say we're heroes, but they're mowing us down. That is a coordinated, multifaceted
[50:58.460 --> 51:01.340]  shy op hitting you at both levels.
[51:01.340 --> 51:05.520]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[51:05.520 --> 51:10.380]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?

[54:02.100 --> 54:08.460]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show. Because there's
[54:08.460 --> 54:13.820]  a war on for your mind. I tell you what, here's what I'm going to do. Because I know a lot
[54:13.820 --> 54:16.740]  of people are tuning in because I've asked listeners to call their friends and family.
[54:16.740 --> 54:20.580]  I'm going to go over these letters where they're just saying there's no judge, there's no jury.
[54:20.580 --> 54:27.420]  We're just going to say you are now, what's the term they use? Incompetent. When you have
[54:27.420 --> 54:31.100]  your 95-year-old dad or whatever, because you won't stop driving the car, you haven't
[54:31.100 --> 54:33.340]  declared incompetent, make them a ward.
[54:33.340 --> 54:37.180]  They're going to make veterans just in mass wards. They're going to make you serve five,
[54:37.180 --> 54:39.820]  six, seven, eight tours. They're going to put people on psychotropics that make them
[54:39.820 --> 54:44.740]  go haywire. And then they're going to use the minority that do bad things, it's a small
[54:44.740 --> 54:48.860]  minority, veterans feel statistically very low crime rate. And they're going to take
[54:48.860 --> 54:54.020]  all of your rights while having we salute the troops at the Super Bowl.
[54:54.020 --> 54:59.500]  And all those psyops. I told you the Mayak and Homeland Security report said the veterans
[54:59.500 --> 55:03.020]  are the number one terror threat. They will attack every city, they will attack every
[55:03.020 --> 55:07.180]  department with IEDs, that's the manuals. And people saw that four years ago and said
[55:07.180 --> 55:13.100]  this can't be real. Veterans will attack every police department? Well, they're going to
[55:13.100 --> 55:16.540]  start a civil war, they're going to hunt you down.
[55:16.540 --> 55:21.340]  If we let them do this, this is outrageous, foreign global is trying to do this. Then
[55:21.340 --> 55:25.140]  I got all the other news. I got Michael Moore saying you shouldn't be able to have any guns,
[55:25.140 --> 55:30.180]  get a dog. Well, he has guns on record and five or six bodyguards every time I've seen
[55:30.180 --> 55:35.460]  him. I've seen him at the DNC with about, let's not exaggerate, ten people, looked like
[55:35.460 --> 55:40.060]  seven of them were bodyguards, three of them were entourage.
[55:40.060 --> 55:43.540]  What is this about entourage? You haven't arrived, you haven't been entouraged behind
[55:43.540 --> 55:47.980]  you? I mean, I guess Michael Moore is the equivalent of five people himself, I'm not
[55:47.980 --> 55:52.040]  trying to be mean. It's just it's so hypocritical, so we're going to be talking about that. By
[55:52.040 --> 55:57.780]  the way, so many times you listen to people, you like their music, you like their art,
[55:57.780 --> 56:01.100]  you like their politics, you like what they say.
[56:01.100 --> 56:05.700]  But you never imagined you'll ever talk to them. And sometimes you talk to them and it's
[56:05.700 --> 56:10.420]  anticlimactic, other times it's even better than you thought. And I was truthful with
[56:10.420 --> 56:15.300]  him. I said, five, six, seven years ago, I disagree with some things you said about the
[56:15.300 --> 56:18.460]  left, how they should all be thrown in prison, cuz that's tyrannical.
[56:18.460 --> 56:21.700]  But now they're saying throw everybody who's a libertarian in prison. I understand it was
[56:21.700 --> 56:26.540]  tongue in cheek, he goes, yeah, you get it. But talk to Michael Savage yesterday, and
[56:26.540 --> 56:32.340]  he's on the show next Tuesday, next Tuesday with some groundbreaking news and information.
[56:32.340 --> 56:36.740]  Not just on his new book being censored, but so much more. This is probably gonna be quite
[56:36.740 --> 56:41.660]  a mix, quite an explosive mix in a good way.
[56:41.660 --> 56:45.020]  Because Savage, I don't wanna say he's reclusive, but he doesn't do a lot of media, and it's
[56:45.020 --> 56:51.500]  hard to get him on the air. And so I am very excited about what is gonna be obviously a
[56:51.500 --> 56:57.240]  newsmaking interview with Michael Savage and the threat he thinks is posed by China infiltrating
[56:57.240 --> 56:58.240]  our government.
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.700]  And I certainly agree with that. But more, he's gonna be on this, I think for about 40
[57:02.700 --> 57:07.780]  minutes or so. I think I gotta get all that nailed down. We have to test ISD in line with
[57:07.780 --> 57:10.660]  him and all that. I even told the producer that I talked to him yesterday afternoon right
[57:10.660 --> 57:16.820]  before his radio show. So I got a 25, 30 minute conversation with Michael Savage, even smarter
[57:16.820 --> 57:18.820]  in person.
[57:18.820 --> 57:22.820]  Because I disagree with some things he said over the years. But overall, he's a patriot,
[57:22.820 --> 57:26.900]  pro Second Amendment, pro sovereignty, been demonized quite a bit, banned from going to
[57:26.900 --> 57:32.340]  England. But I mean, I can't believe people I get to talk to. I mean, I'm sitting there
[57:32.340 --> 57:35.900]  for like 25 minutes talking to Michael Savage.
[57:35.900 --> 57:39.660]  And he didn't say any of this is off record, but he was saying quite a bit interesting
[57:39.660 --> 57:44.140]  stuff that's just gonna be off record. If he wants to say it on air, he is welcome to.
[57:44.140 --> 57:52.780]  But I certainly don't kiss and tell, as they say, in the journalism business. So wow, Michael
[57:52.780 --> 57:57.260]  Savage, very interesting, very, very interesting.
[57:57.260 --> 58:01.300]  The things we talked about to say the least, Amanda, if that was on radio, that would be
[58:01.300 --> 58:04.940]  powerful. So we'll see what happens next Tuesday. And there's some other big stuff gonna happen
[58:04.940 --> 58:10.340]  next week that's even bigger than that. It's not a guest bigger than Michael Savage. If
[58:10.340 --> 58:14.780]  this happens, it'll probably be one of the biggest things we ever did.
[58:14.780 --> 58:30.780]  And muy grande, how do you say dangerous in Spanish? Belly groso? Muy grande belly groso?
[58:30.780 --> 58:36.380]  Belly groso. Just my life is really like a science fiction movie. But all our lives are

[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:20.620]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:34.700]  Alex Jones. Speaking of Michael Savage, who I talked to yesterday is on with us next Tuesday.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:40.180]  He got criticized a decade ago talking about all the disease coming out of Mexico. The
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:45.980]  drug immune TB, all of it. Thousands may have been exposed to deadly TB epidemic downtown
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:51.060]  LA. And again, it's all pretty much coming out of Mexico. And I mean, it's a third world
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.060]  collapsing country.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.840]  Be like if we had India next door or something. You understand if we keep taking all these
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.740]  people and it lowers the wages, it's gonna collapse the economy. And that's the globalist
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:09.900]  plan. It's just so incredible. I wanna build Mexico up, but you don't let Mexico an authoritarian
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.940]  country use the US as a steam valve.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.020]  And the globalist here want that cuz it's part of North American Union. I just have
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.380]  goodwill and know that the globalist are behind all this and it makes me sick. So we're gonna
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:27.060]  be getting to that report out of, what is that, CBS. We're gonna be getting to all of
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:35.300]  that coming up. And we got all these distractions going on. The feds to sue Lance Armstrong.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:40.780]  I mean, come on. Professional sports is full of drugs. I'm not saying that's okay. Go after
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:46.840]  the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve for LIBOR scandal fixing interest rates. Let's
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.580]  go after all the stuff that again makes Bernie Madoff look like an angel compared to it.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.700]  Let's go after the government narcotics trafficking. All we're hearing about is Oscar Pistorius,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:02.280]  is that how you pronounce it? I've been ignoring this. The granted bail ahead of murder trial.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.860]  Every news channel, you wouldn't think they're gearing up for war with Iran. War in Syria,
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:14.300]  Libya, destabilization, new Al-Qaeda alerts, imploding economy, all I'm hearing about.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:25.800]  All I'm hearing about. Look at this, FBI agents caught sexting drug dealers. Man, just such
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.840]  a corrupt society. And what do you think happens to FBI agents and people that are involved
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.820]  in the drug running and stuff? I mean, they're around it. I mean, they're instantly taken
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:40.140]  to a party, hooked up with the cream of the Midwest farm girl, who's a whore now, and
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.500]  they're controlled by the underworld ever after.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.740]  How do you stop that? You stop, I'm reading Drudge Report right now, that's why I'm doing
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:52.860]  that, Biden to gun owners. You've had no better friend out there in 35 years than me. He's
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:59.980]  re-quoting the same crap he said over and over and over again. Politico's been frozen
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:04.560]  out after calling Obama the puppet master. Yeah, they were just writing about what an
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.180]  incredible manipulator he was and how much they loved it.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:12.240]  But no, no, Obama's not a puppet master. In fact, I saw Zero Dark Thirty where they killed
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.740]  the Easter Bunny. I mean, bin Laden, I mean, Santa Claus, I mean, the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:21.060]  And it showed the film, and it must be real, and it has Obama on there saying, I will not
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.060]  allow torture.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:25.780]  It doesn't matter that they estimate they've doubled the black sites, the ghost sites,
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:29.600]  the torture sites. It doesn't matter they found one in Benghazi down the street when
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.580]  they ordered to stand down where they're torturing people. It doesn't matter, he has a peace
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:41.300]  prize. So when he attacks Libya, or Syria, or five different other African countries,
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:45.020]  it's loving, it's liberal.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.300]  Now when we come back, I'm gonna focus, cover the news, and then I'm gonna go to your phone
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.240]  calls and a bunch of video clips. But I'll get the number out when we come back in the
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:58.640]  next segment. I intend soon to change the clock. It was I, 14 years ago, 15 years ago
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.620]  when we started the weekday show, I was doing a weeknight before that, where I said, I don't
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.340]  like stations having to carry brainwashing news.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:10.740]  So we'll just have five minutes where I do the news, or cover stuff, and then we'll have
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.180]  a three minute, we'll come in the day after. And stations adopt that, but they don't like
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.580]  it. So we're gonna leave the whole clock alone, except I gotta get around to having it reprogrammed.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.900]  John Harmon, you should look into that fellow running the show right now in Minnesota. We
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.520]  should look at keeping the exact same clock, but I'll just do three minutes there until
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.140]  we reprogram it all officially with news, and then come out at six after. Don't you
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:41.380]  think that's the way to go, buddy? Okay, good, yeah, we'll get that done.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:45.980]  And then I am going to, again, get into the veterans. We're just calmly talking about,
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.580]  yeah, outside of law, the veterans have their guns taken now, and anybody else the government
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.680]  wants. But I mean, that's good. I mean, we don't need any due process anymore. I mean,
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:01.300]  we have our peace prize winner after all, dictator Obama.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:05.480]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.340]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:15.780]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:20.540]  Tyranical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:25.260]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:29.900]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:28.940]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen. The information I have really makes me speechless.
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:34.940]  I knew it was coming, but it's moving so fast. It just blows us away. They are sending arbitrary
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:41.140]  letters to veterans telling them they're gonna have to turn their guns in. No judge, no jury,
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.140]  no proof.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.300]  It's just like Rahm Emanuel said when he was White House Chief of Staff. He said, we're
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:50.500]  just gonna put whoever we want on a no gun buy list, just like a no fly list. No judge,
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:56.660]  no jury. The ATF is ordering gun shops to file criminal reports on people buying guns
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.600]  so that they have some type of probable cause.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.480]  They're claiming it's criminal to buy two or more rifles or it's suspicious. Now, that's
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.100]  outside of law. It's already on record that they bought rifles, handguns, long rifles.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:16.260]  They do that because under statutory regulations, when the gun shop reports someone bought the
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:22.840]  two firearms, like it's a criminal report, then the ATF quote has to act.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.020]  And then they put the gun owner in a database, and then they have an excuse to come get the
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:32.720]  records and then basically register you. And so it's all color of law fraud that's going
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:41.500]  on. But if you go up to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, you'll see it linked in red, federal government
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:46.020]  moves to disarm veterans and I'm gonna cover this and then I'm gonna give the number out.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:52.620]  I wanna hear from veterans specifically and police on this subject. Veterans, police,
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:57.720]  active duty only. I wanna get your quick take on this.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:03.120]  We knew this was coming for a long time. Bill Clinton tried this when he left office back
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:12.580]  in 1999. Almost 90,000, I think it was 87,000 troops were told. Well, remember in Vietnam
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.240]  when you collapsed from heat exhaustion, that's now being listed in your file as post-traumatic
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.720]  stress you can't own guns.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.060]  No criminal record, grandfathers, you name it. I talked to a famous UT football player,
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.440]  later became a professional football player. He said I could tell the story but not his
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.520]  name. I was at a birthday party years ago, he told me. A lot of people would know who
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.920]  he is, I said his name.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.480]  And he went to buy a 22 for his grandson. They said you can't buy guns anymore. And
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.980]  he went through the thing with lawyers and everything. They said Vietnam, you've got
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:44.720]  a designation and you can't have guns anymore. Doesn't matter if it had been 35, 40 years.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:52.880]  This is how this country is now going to be run. Just like last week and also last year,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:59.320]  I get a letter saying $1,200 in fees. Somebody put up three signs with infoawars.com on them,
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]  homemade.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.960]  You're guilty. And I wrote him a letter back and said, well, what if people put Obama signs
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:14.680]  up? Do you send him $400 fines per sign? And they wouldn't respond. There's no judge, there's
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.120]  no jury, there's no citation. They say, the mayor's office, you can read the letters at
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.520]  infoawars.com, has conducted an investigation.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.080]  And you will pay or we will put, A, a warrant out for your arrest. And if you know the law,
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.600]  folks, what they're doing is a hardcore federal and state felony. Color of law, extortion,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.420]  fraud. Same thing if I dressed up like a cop and came to your house and said, give me $5,000,
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.720]  you're going to jail.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.680]  Serious felony. Well, when a cop or the government steps out of their bounds, it's an even more
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.280]  serious felony. But Antonio Villaraigosa, sending people letters, you're going to pay
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.660]  us $1,200 or we're going to have you arrested. No judge, no jury, no citation, no grand jury,
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:03.160]  no indictment, no criminal code, no court, nothing.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.960]  Just like the NDAA, just like the Patriot Act. If they swore it was for Al-Qaeda only,
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.920]  and now they go, you know what it is for gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians,
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.360]  conservatives, and born again Christians. I've got the whole list right here in an incredible
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.240]  article, 14 pages long by Washington's blog that is the master of aggregating all the
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.600]  proof.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:33.040]  How many rights have Americans really lost? And it goes over 14 pages with links to fpi.gov
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:39.380]  that's public. And basically every activity is now an act of terrorism. I'm going to read
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:44.440]  some of this after I get into this news and take your calls. But here it is, ladies and
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.160]  gentlemen, federal government moves to disarm veterans.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  It's no secret the Department of Homeland Security considers returning veterans a threat
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.160]  to the established order. They said as much back in 2009 when they wrote in a special
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.600]  report exposed by Alex Jones and the alternative media. Returning veterans pose combat skills
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:10.320]  and experience that are attractive to right wing extremists. DHS INA is concerned that
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.160]  right wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.880]  their violent capabilities.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.960]  They go on to say that the number one threat following the case of veteran Brandon Robb,
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.420]  who was abducted for just criticizing Obama and held in a psychiatric ward for Facebook
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:31.160]  post and government considers subversive. Police in Ohio seized a veteran's guns after
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.280]  he was adjudicated to be mentally incompetent despite the fact that a veteran's administration
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.860]  psychiatric evaluation determined he was not mentally ill.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.220]  Since the veteran is active in the so called truth movement or patriot movement, it is
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:49.440]  assumed involvement in this field is part of a reason why he's been targeted for psychiatric
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.800]  evaluation, Paul Joseph Watson wrote. According to constitutional attorney Michael Conley,
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.440]  we're gonna get on and he has the official letters.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.920]  The government is now moving to strip veterans it determines to be mentally incompetent.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.660]  Other Second Amendment right to own firearms Conley cites a letter shipped by the US Department
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:12.940]  of Veterans Affairs to hundreds, perhaps thousands. It's thousands of America's heroes. You're
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.900]  the enemy of the foreigners that took this country over. A determination of incompetency
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.020]  will prohibit you from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:25.960]  This is from the letter, a firearms or ammunition. The VA letter states if you knowingly violate
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.720]  any of these probations and prohibitions, you will be fined in prison or both pursuant
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:36.740]  to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Publication L number 103-159 is implemented
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:42.240]  under 18 United States Code 92482. Now that's a misappropriation of it.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.640]  When Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor's office said give me $1200, I'll arrest you or sue
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:51.920]  you or give you a bad credit report, it threatens all three. There's no code, no nothing. So
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.400]  see, it's even a bigger fraud. And again, I've confirmed all over the country, the police
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.280]  show up and say, you can't be building in that barn.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.800]  Well, I've always lived here. We got horses in there. We say it's condemned. I see in
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.280]  there you're arrested. You know, well, that's not been adjudicated. That's not been. Listen,
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.800]  you go in there again, I'm gonna arrest you. Do you understand, boy? And see, they're just
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.680]  testing to see what they can do.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.640]  And again, people are like, why are they doing this? Simultaneously worshiping the veterans.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.600]  Well, that's to make the establishment look good. Their agenda, they use the veterans
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:34.040]  like wallpaper on. They package it, it's sugar coating on cyanide pill. Because you can say
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.040]  what you want about these wars.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:41.160]  I know the tropes. I'd never been a hind kisser when it came to the military until I became
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:47.600]  older and more sophisticated and found out biggest part of my audience is the military.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.740]  Because they live in the real world, folks. They see the training for gun confiscation.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.020]  They know about government lies. And they know I've studied all this and they respect
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.320]  this show cuz they realize I know what I'm talking about.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.040]  They go into classified briefings here. Everything they could see in a video I made 14 years
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.480]  ago because I have all the classified sources. And not just classified sources, police chiefs
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.600]  like L.A. Philippus, who was an army intelligence himself, San Antonio police chief, Thomas
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:17.760]  Sanchez, intelligence in Vietnam, county manager in Kingsville, Texas.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.360]  They come to him and say we're training for martial law. He blows the whistle. I mean,
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.840]  I've talked to hundreds of these people. Travis County SWAT team commander. I went and told
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.440]  him what was coming. He laughed at me. I said, all right, here's my card. You call me when
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.820]  they come. Cuz I knew they'd been going to every major city in Texas.
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.400]  And I looked that they'd been to all the big ones. Next had to be Austin. And I knew about
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:45.080]  the program. This is a Pentagon infiltration of everything. And it's not our Pentagon,
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:52.600]  it's far and run. The Pentagon's over the Rural Affairs Commission now with Homeland
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.560]  Security and what do they train for?
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.600]  Folks, they have rural affairs meetings that are in the news where they invite all the
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:05.000]  old farmers and people in at the local hotel, have coffee, donuts for a two day event. Lunch,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.080]  things provided. And the first days Al-Qaeda training videos, the first few hours, then
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.960]  they go right into, are your neighbors growing marijuana?
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.840]  Are your neighbors spanking their kids? Are your neighbors criticizing Obama? And these
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:21.400]  people are videotaping this and putting it on YouTube, freaking out. I mean, imagine
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.880]  being World War II in Korea and Vietnam vets and you wanna fight terrorists, which are
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.620]  non existent, they're run by the globalists.
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:33.080]  You go to a FBI event and an hour into it, they're bad mouthing George Washington. And
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:38.760]  they're there to see how you act. You're being assessed. You didn't know why you got invited
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.880]  to that Infra Guard meeting. You're being assessed at a briefing. You're being put in
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.980]  a target sheet. You're being like, hey, the FBI wants you to come down and talk to us.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:53.000]  They don't do that. Yeah, the church is inviting, especially veterans down to meet with the
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.080]  FBI at the local hotel or the local VFW. Lunch is provided. And you get there and it's like,
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.440]  I'm Captain Johnson, former Special Forces now assigned to FEMA.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.560]  We wanna talk about the threats to America. Here's Al Qaeda training videos. You don't
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.840]  like Al Qaeda, do you? Now, let's talk about the first terrorist. It was George Washington,
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.440]  Thomas Jefferson. Well, there's people like that today and they say they're not gonna
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.840]  go along with inoculation during an emergency or gun confiscation.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.120]  I mean, I've got these training videos. I've put clips of them out in my films, Road to
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.880]  Tyranny. Everybody's sitting there going, what is this? And you can see a guy behind
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.920]  the other guy watching. Okay, Tom Jones, Bill Brown just looked like they were upset. I'm
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.480]  gonna talk to him during a lunch break.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.200]  They're like, hey, Bill Brown, how you doing? So what do you think about this meeting? You're
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.320]  being assessed, folks, like you're in a torture chamber. That's next down the road. I don't
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.860]  like this. I don't like bad mouth in George Washington. I hear you, I hear you. Well,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:52.600]  we won't be needing your help anymore. Thanks a lot. You're targeted as an enemy. They pat
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.080]  you on the butt as you go out.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.120]  And everybody else like, well, I got a nice flock of useful leaders who will sit here
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  and that's why people go, it doesn't make sense. Why are they bad mouthing George Washington
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.560]  on our end of the meeting? This is universal to see. And if you don't like George Washington,
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:13.780]  they go, hey, you're with us now.
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:17.240]  And like even those guys are like, well, we don't really dislike George Washington behind
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.280]  the scenes. We're just doing that to see if there's extremists, cuz we know they'll get
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.860]  upset by that. You understand, right? And you've just been introduced to the hating
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:28.380]  George Washington. Cuz you're introduced to the lie of, see, we can say we're against
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.080]  George Washington, but we really aren't against George Washington.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.820]  You understand? We just stand for everything he stood against. I'm gonna get back to the
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:41.760]  actual manuals and the actual letters to start the civil war when we come back. Total free

[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:33.720]  We, the people, grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:37.600]  from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.640]  taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.040]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.040]  a standing army?

[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:13.480]  Let me break down basically what's happened. They've taken a Soviet Eastern Bloc takeover
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:19.360]  model, how the Soviets would infiltrate and take down a country from within. And integrated
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.840]  it with Western teaching how they would counter to try to go into countries and keep them
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.680]  from falling to the Soviets or take them over. But they're going and assessing all the police,
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.360]  all the military, and it's been ongoing for 20 years, but now it's accelerating to the
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.120]  order of 10.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:40.200]  And they are going around now finding out locally who is gonna not go along with this.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.720]  And again, they say over the top stuff, so you'll identify yourself. So police, that's
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.720]  some good intel for you. I'm sure you already knew this, common sense. If you wanna stay
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.920]  on the police force, act like you hate George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and act like
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:55.920]  you hate freedom.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.440]  If you're in an intelligence unit or a special events unit that have been federalized, the
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:05.540]  special response units, you're not gonna get that job unless you just act like a total
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:10.520]  authoritarian cult member. But they do psychological studies as well. I mean, they really know
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.160]  who is and who isn't.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.860]  But after they've done that, they're now expanding to the next group of detectives and managers
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.720]  and captains and others. And then they're gonna expand as they've done in LA and New
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:26.160]  York and Chicago, down to beat cops. England's already done this. They are now political
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.320]  enforcers, spying, sitting in restaurants, listening to people, it's all in the news.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:36.320]  You'll hear, man arrested for racial comment to his wife. You're like, well, that's racist,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.280]  good arresting. He said something about foreigners. It's the end of free speech. I mean, Michael
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.200]  Savage is banned from entering England because he criticized Muslims.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:51.360]  Well, I mean, isn't that the free speech of a European, of a Brit, of an American? Whether
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:56.120]  you agree with this statement or not, you see, that's just an example of this. And that's
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.900]  what's now coming here.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.760]  And the magnitude, let me show you up at infowars.com, if you're a TV viewer or a radio listener,
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.320]  go there. It's federal government moves to disarm vets. And there it is blown up from
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.080]  page number two, Department of Veterans Affairs, a determination of incompetence will prohibit
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:18.560]  you from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm's ammunition.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.120]  If you knowingly violate any of these prohibitions, you will be fined and prisoned or both under
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.080]  the Brady Handgun Prevention Act. Again, now that's the provisions not defeated by Sheriff
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:35.120]  Max, Richard Mack's suit. That provision stood, other parts were struck down. We've gotta
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.040]  get this repealed because they're now going to implement this.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.900]  This is if you were adjudicated by a judge and stripped, and that's very hard to do,
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:55.800]  of your mental faculties, then you would lose your right to keep and bear arms. Now, continuing,
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:01.840]  they're just people who've always owned guns or having the police show up and say, Mr.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:08.920]  Gonzalez, Mr. Khan, whatever your last name is, you've got to come out here and Mr. Smith
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.300]  and surrender the firearms.
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:15.960]  What they do is they mail you a letter a lot of times and if you don't respond, then they
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.960]  say, okay, we're gonna come out to your house. And sometimes they SWAT team you as an intimidation
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.880]  thing to say, see, we SWAT team. Have you seen the checkpoints they shut up in New York
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.920]  now, where they have license plate readers and they have them flagged to ping, this is
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.400]  admitted on vets?
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:38.940]  And it mattered, no criminal record, upstanding, Bronze Star winners, you're arrested. We got
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:45.080]  five 223 mags in here above 10 rounds. They're like, did the law ban those? Yep, we're charging
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.440]  you with felonies. And the guy's like, why are you throwing the book at me? And they
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.320]  go, we're making an example of you.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.840]  But I run a local veterans charity group, I have no criminal record, I'm a veteran.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.720]  You're the target, bud, that's all a cover. The government's your friend's veteran, the
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.880]  NFL's your friends, everyone loves you. This is not an assault, Tet Offensive, Chinese
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.520]  New Year, go to sleep, we're not gonna invade, boom, they attack at midnight.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.360]  Just like Waco, you know military tactics, military. They camouflage themselves, they
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:24.720]  don't announce this. They're like, whoa, the veterans are the bestie, we love you. My gosh,
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:29.560]  take these experimental shots, you're having organ failure right now?
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:35.240]  Should have said yes on gun confiscation on that questionnaire. Of course, the doctor
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:40.320]  is compartmentalized, the nurse, the RNs, they don't know. I'm decompartmentalizing
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.460]  this for you. I've been doing this for 20 years. I've been obsessed with this, dreaming
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.320]  about it at night for 17.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.520]  I know the whole game plan. I know it better than the people at the CIA, the FBI, the NSA,
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.520]  because 99% of them are compartmentalized. There are very few people even in the power
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.520]  structure that know how this whole thing's meant to go down. It's so complex, I can't
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.040]  even articulate it to you, okay?
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.640]  I'm not bragging about this. I know the whole plan, because I've probably read 30 bucks
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.680]  on the Soviets. I've probably read 10 bucks on the pre-Soviet era. I've probably read
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.920]  15 bucks on the czars. I've probably read 100 bucks on the Nazis. I've probably read
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.560]  50 bucks on the Vatican. I've read 25 or more bucks on British history, on Roman history,
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560]  on African history.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.900]  I've read probably over 1,000 history books on these subjects, and I know what the globalists
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.980]  are doing and how they've integrated all these systems of control. You want to start somewhere?
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:39.040]  Heinz Hobel's Order of the Deaf said, 800 pages long, read that. You'll be like, this
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.080]  is everything that's happening here. How Hitler had to take out all the secret societies and
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.440]  people. I thought they didn't exist. How the secret societies battle with each other, the
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.240]  whole nine yards.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:30:00.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.760]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.440]  pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.680]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:20.080]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.160]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160]  be healthy.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:32.120]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.

[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:21.200]  fooled again. He aligns himself with the truth. And it's time for you to choose a side. You're

[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:45.160]  hole in your backyard. Watch out when you walk out your back door. You know, Sam's not going to go
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:49.000]  how dare you fear monger and be like, wow, really? That's that noise I heard in the night. I better
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:58.280]  go look into this. I mean, that hole is there and you can debate how deep it is or who made it or
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.520]  how much worse it's going to get. But we're in a lot of trouble. I mean, you add together
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.640]  the 2 billion plus bullets they bought the last year. You add the armored vehicles,
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:12.520]  the urban warfare training everywhere with the local police helping in the raids.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:17.240]  I mean, this is now openly for America for the American people. Homeland Security announced
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.760]  again this year. Yes, the military is going to respond to domestic extremists. Totally illegal.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:32.040]  Yes. You know, the Pentagon is over rural affairs. The Pentagon, the army, the Navy,
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:37.960]  the Marine Corps, NORTHCOM. We're a military district now. It's in the Army Times,
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.920]  it's everywhere and it's wrong. And the people that are awake are actually our military.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.120]  By and large, because they hear this show and they know what I'm saying is real.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.440]  And a lot of times they're like, yes, some of this didn't make sense. Now it all makes sense
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:59.240]  because I'm not compartmentalized. Because humans act the same.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:05.320]  And so many of the systems the globalist are using are Roman, are German, are French,
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:12.040]  are British, are Russian. Are authoritarian models used before, but then overlaid with
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.400]  current technology. Now I'm gonna finish up with the news and go right to your calls for Will,
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.880]  Chad, Jim, Tim, Ronald, and Rich. I wanna go to you guys quick, make your point.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:26.600]  I'm gonna go to the next person or I'll never get through it in this hour. It's just all the
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:32.920]  other news. Yeah, the Blade Runner guy in South Africa, maybe premeditatedly shooting his wife or
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.760]  girlfriend, whatever. Yeah, that still doesn't matter to a hill of beans at the end of the day.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:40.680]  Even the imploding economy by design isn't as important as
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.080]  there are giant domestic CIA networks publicly operating everywhere.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:52.920]  Jesse Ventura, in the 90s, first day at work, they go, people like to meet with you in the
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.200]  basement of the Capitol. He goes in there and there's 25 CIA people, old ladies, old men,
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:03.080]  dressed like old ladies that give you cookies. It's totally illegal.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.680]  And my issue is they're not protecting us from Al-Qaeda folks, they run Al-Qaeda,
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:14.040]  and that's now public as well. They use Al-Qaeda to take our liberties as a threat, as a boogeyman.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.240]  It's like your three year old won't stop going to the street. You can say, there's a boogeyman
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.760]  will get you if you do. That's the old way to keep your kids in lines, not to give them weapons,
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:29.320]  is to tell them wives tales. A witch will come and get you if you don't do what you're told.
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  Let me tell you, that kid isn't gonna be going to the street anymore.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.760]  Same thing, you give up all your rights, so the boogeyman bin Laden gonna get you.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:42.760]  You saw what he did on 9-11, didn't you? I mean, come on, folks. Come on, your gut knows 20 Saudis
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.200]  didn't pull all that off. Were there real Saudis here, led into the country? Yeah, but the official
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:56.040]  story's a lie. There was a stand down, that's bare minimum. It was America's Reichstag fire,
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.880]  and you add in all the preparations and paper targets of babies.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.640]  And people are like, well, that must be what not to shoot. No, it officially says,
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:10.360]  this is Homeland Security requested targets of five-year-old kids, pregnant women, old men
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.080]  wearing John Deere hats. Folks, how many times have I told you that? I've shot the video,
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:21.640]  you don't have to believe me. I've got four films of urban warfare with the role players wearing
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:27.960]  overalls, coveralls, mechanic outfits, 49ers shirts, cowboy shirts, John Deere hats,
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:35.640]  ACDC shirts. They practice to kill us. And it's not saying the troops are bad,
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:39.480]  they're trying to acclimate them, the police, everybody else.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:43.080]  And I've got a Jakari Jackson report, he just so happened to be working on a few days ago
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.600]  about this. He's added the latest info to it, that's coming up after we take some calls.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.560]  But I wanna say this, we're an hour and a half into this broadcast, and I know the economy's
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:55.960]  shutting down and this country's going to hell in a handbasket. But we are one of the best and only
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.880]  hopes out there. There is no, I've said this many times, and they actually say this in Zero Dark 30,
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.360]  because it's true. They walk into the bin Laden unit, and I've actually talked to the real folks
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.520]  in the bin Laden unit who were ordered not to kill him over and over again until he died of natural
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:15.880]  kidney failure, Colonel Shafer and others. And Steve Pacinek, former head psychiatrist
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:19.240]  of Black Ops, the whole thing, I mean, it's all fake, folks. And
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.600]  one of the sub directors walks in and goes, listen, there is no other secret team trying
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.880]  to take out bin Laden. This is the only group, we're all that's there.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.560]  And we're not that good, but we're all that's there. Well, you've heard me say that 100 times.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.600]  I didn't wanna be numeral uno, I didn't wanna be tip of the spear.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:45.080]  But I've got the energy and the will to do it. And we now are the biggest and really one of the only
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.120]  shows really telling it like it is. And it's an incredible position of responsibility.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:56.760]  And I'm not on a power trip over it, it's the opposite. I am humbled to my core. And Rich did
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.920]  receive the letter from the VA, and he's in Connecticut. This is out of Washington State
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.960]  saying, get ready to turn your guns in, holy Toledo, man.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:09.800]  This is like going to the doctor and they tell you you got cancer. I mean,
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.600]  I get a pain, not a fear, but that pain when you get the call. One of your kids is hurt.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.920]  We've all gotten that call at work and you're like, what is it? I don't know, your wife says
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.920]  it's serious. And you call and, okay, busted his head open, but that's not that big of a deal.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.120]  Thank God it wasn't a car wreck. It's not even a fear, it's more of a,
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:35.640]  mm, mm, man, this is serious. That mm, every day now it's mm for the country.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.120]  Oh, man, they really are gonna hammer down with Obamacare and shut down all the jobs and
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.360]  tax the poor people. Man, that's hardcore, mm, they really are criminals. It's worse than I
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:52.440]  thought. Mm, it hits you. And I look up there and see Rich, vet, did receive letter and I get a mm.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.200]  Get that feeling in my stomach, get a chill after that like,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.680]  you know, my whole nervous system is like danger, Will Robinson, danger. And I know you're feeling
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.400]  that too. And there's a chance we can back these people off, but not if we don't admit
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.920]  how much trouble we're in, okay? That's the only thing that's gonna get this taken care of.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:16.600]  We gotta pray to God to give us guidance as well because they can use so many psyops on us.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.440]  And the point is I was just in there looking at some of the new equipment,
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:25.000]  some of the new studios we need to really do first class news, the uplinks, all the stuff.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.680]  It costs a lot of money to run this organization. I need more personnel.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.200]  I need to pay my personnel. I need the equipment. I need to be able to fight as best I can.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:38.760]  And that's why it is a war bond for the Republic. When you go to info wars,
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.160]  shop.com or info war store.com and buy propier water filters, they're already the lowest price.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.800]  But I mean, just get in, they should be double price and you should buy them.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.680]  Bumper stickers, those are sold at cost. The magazine, the T-shirts, the ball caps,
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:56.760]  the videos, the films. The Alex Jones everything special, the New World Order playing deck of cards,
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.680]  educate your friends and family, the ball caps, the Obama shirts, the Second Amendment shirts.
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.560]  It's a war for info. We've got to get in the field. We need to get our mass up in this
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:11.000]  military operation against the globalists and the info war. Infowarstore.com, we need capital.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.160]  We need capital. I want to thank everybody that supported us, everybody that's gotten
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.880]  the word out for us, everybody that spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:22.920]  All our affiliates are sponsors, but even though our audience exponentially grows,
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.600]  revenue in 2013 is down everywhere. I know you see the financial papers as well,
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.440]  so I know it's rough out there. But if the people that are still middle class are wealthy,
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:35.880]  cuz I don't want poor people donating or buying stuff, okay?
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:39.080]  I know it makes you feel good and it's important and you wanna be part of the effort, but
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:44.760]  it's all the tightwads out there that need to get books and videos. And Ron Paul books,
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.040]  father of the Tea Party and plundered and strategic relocation and everything that's
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:56.040]  available at infowarshop.com and get it out to people because this is serious business folks.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.280]  If we don't all get aggressive and spend time, energy and treasure in this fight,
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.160]  we're gonna lose it all. I'm willing to lose my life over this thing. I'm not happy about it,
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.880]  I'll assure you. But there is no future if we don't beat them.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.680]  I know they could even go out for my family and I just,
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:16.680]  I don't even pray to God to protect my family. Actually, I do sometimes. I mainly just pray,
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:23.320]  God, whatever your will is, just please help me be more articulate. Please help others wake up.
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.440]  All right, I'm gonna go to your calls. I'm pretty shook up right now because
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:31.320]  I knew it was coming, they announced they were gonna do it. And these are not like troops beating
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:37.080]  their wife or troops that got caught doing something illegal. This is mainline veterans,
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.440]  special forces, Navy SEALs, especially special forces. You're the enemy.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:47.400]  You're a weapon to be decommissioned. They're moving to robots, they're moving to drones.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.880]  They don't want you anymore. And they're coming after you. And by the way, the Soviets and the
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:57.080]  Nazis did this. After Hitler took over about two years later, first he called the Brownshirts,
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.520]  his own kind of gang that took him to power, against Rome.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:07.880]  And then they had Crystal Night. Well, that was against Jews. They had Night of the Long Knives,
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.360]  and then they had other nights that came a few years later. And they were even arresting
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.600]  sergeants from the old Weimar Republic military. And the more decorated you were,
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:24.120]  the more you were dead. Hitler got so paranoid by the end, he was just whacking everybody.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.200]  Listen, I'm warning you, the Soviets did the same thing, Mao did the same thing.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:35.880]  Mao did the same thing. This is a trap. This is a trap, you fools, all right? I mean, this is evil.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.040]  You don't wanna be signed on to this. Okay, let's stop right there and go to your calls.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.520]  Rich in Connecticut, a vet who said he did receive the letter. I'm gonna give you our email. It's
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.800]  showtipsatinfoawars.com. All vets, black out your name or cut it out,
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.920]  and then mail us your letters so we can add them and triple confirm all this.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.360]  Rich, tell us in Connecticut what you got in your response to this, sir.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:04.680]  Basically, when I got the letter from the VA, honestly, I don't really pay attention.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.480]  I've been a longtime listener. This was my first time calling, so I'm a little bit nervous.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:17.640]  Anyway, yeah, when I received it, I don't actually know when I received it.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:21.720]  Back off your phone just a bit. Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.560]  The point is, in your pile of stuff, everybody has that problem. In your pile of magazines
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.480]  and junk mail, you found this. Go ahead. Yeah, this is after I saw the
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.080]  on your website that people were getting this, and I went back through my VA mail.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:44.200]  Usually, it's just appointments and stuff like that. And because I'm 100% disabled,
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:56.760]  and because of PTSD, I got this letter stating that I was no longer eligible to possess or
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:00.360]  purchase. And by the way, PTSD,
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.960]  some of it is real, but the name from a psychologist I've talked to, it's pretty much
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:11.080]  most of it. It's like saying hyper kids have ADHD. Well, no, they're drinking soda pop and
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.560]  eating junk food all day and bouncing off the walls, sugar crashing. If I give my kids sugar,
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.240]  they act like satanic demons. If I give them healthy food, they act like angels.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.680]  I mean, if I gave my animals, my dog sugar, they act like maniacs.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.040]  So the issue is, sir, you need to fight that. I understand, see how they set it up?
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:32.360]  We'll give you money if you say you've got a problem. And I understand combat
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.600]  stress and all that, but I think a lot of it is a hoax. I'm not saying in your case,
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:41.240]  but please continue. Well, I'm a Desert Storm veteran. I was a medic
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:48.040]  with an infantry unit during Desert Storm. Well, you probably don't have PTSD. You probably,
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.880]  you were there when chemical detectors went off then.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.080]  Yeah. Well, you got nerve gas, buddy.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:56.280]  You got nerve gas from blowing up Camosia and other facilities. Go ahead.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:07.080]  Oh, I'm sorry. Basically, I'm not going to comply. I don't give a crap what they say anymore.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:13.240]  I'm actually, you know, they give you medication that purposely makes you overweight and
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:21.240]  everything. I've been, I have started taking your longevity products, the tangy tangerine and stuff,
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:27.960]  and that slim FX, this fine direct FX. And I've been losing a lot of weight
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:33.800]  because of that. And I'm slowly getting off the medication because
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:40.440]  when I drink the tangy tangerine, I don't feel like I need the medication.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:46.920]  I know. When I started taking it a few years ago, I was so undernourished even though I was
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.320]  eating healthier food. Still, the soils are depleted that I got high off of it for like a
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:55.160]  month. And I'm drinking some right now. It's funny, you brought up beyond tangy tangerine
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:02.440]  at Infowarshealth.com. It's just off the chart. They just had a big Clemson University study about
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:08.760]  how it kills 95% of cancer cells and leaves the healthy cells alone. I mean, just amazing
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.000]  information. And it's basically got the research of Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize winner,
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.560]  going into it along with Dr. Wallach's research. And so much of our problems, as I just said,
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:24.120]  with ADHD is nutritional. Kids are eating white bread, drinking Coca-Cola, filled with all sorts
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.840]  of chemicals in it, and speed caffeine. Of course, you're acting like a demon.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:38.280]  But listen, these letters are nebulous. They're like, hey, you may have been ruled incompetent.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:43.640]  Well, you're not incompetent. And so again, they're leaving a color of law. They're seeing
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.720]  if they can get away with this. It's like an employee that starts stealing a little bit out
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:52.360]  of the cash register. And if they get away with that a little more, a little more, a little more,
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:58.840]  and they finally get caught. So what they're doing is a fraud. So I would consult with legal
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:02.600]  counsel that represents veterans. And let me ask you this, do you have a criminal record?
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:10.200]  Yes, I do. Is it a felony? No. Well, then that's a non-issue. You've got your second amendment.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.800]  They're fraudulently trying to apply this. Do me a favor. Do you have a scanner to scan that
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:25.000]  and send it to us? Yeah, what's the number? Or don't give it to me after I'm all flocked.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.760]  Sure, we can find, we should have a fax number always at hand. But we do so few faxes. I don't
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:38.120]  even know if it's hooked up. Let me, do you want our email address? Well, can I just send it to
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:43.240]  one of the editors? Cuz it's on the website, if I can just send it to one of the editors.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.640]  Yeah, I just wanna know which, sure, send it to Kurt Nemo.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:51.960]  Okay. It's just show tips. Everybody's reading that. And so it has a better chance of getting
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:56.280]  seen. I'm telling you, sometimes some famous person will call me and go, I've been sending
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.280]  emails for six months. And then I'll go, what's your email? And I'll search it, and there are all
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:07.320]  the emails. And it's just torture, cuz we're trying to read it all, but we get 20,000 emails
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:12.600]  a day. I'm not exaggerating. And it's very hard to go through them all. But everybody, just send
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.200]  your letters that you've gotten. God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Will
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:22.920]  in Oklahoma, another vet. What do you think about this? Alex, this is ridiculous, man. You got guys
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.200]  that serve their country, and then they come back and they have their rights taken away.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:34.200]  I'm a Marine vet myself. I served my country for five years. I was one of the vets that,
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.080]  one of the Marines that was being experimented on with the anthrax vaccines and have the evidence
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:46.120]  to prove it. And then about a year and a half later, they came to my house, the VA did,
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.040]  and was, well, I got a letter in the mail saying that they were checking me for incompetence,
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:58.600]  because I get three or four migraines a week. I have fibromyalgia real bad.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:03.080]  Yeah, stay there. I'm gonna hold you over. This is important. For those that don't know,
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.560]  twice they've given the Porton down.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.560]  No, that's the name of the group in England where they nerve gassed them.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:18.440]  It's that Michigan Bioport, Bioport, the Bioport lab, and it's illegal. The vaccine
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:23.080]  was experimental, killed a bunch of people, and yeah, that's it. I've had doctors on about it
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:26.920]  when they did it in two different phases back in the 90s, and again, wasn't about 95.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.240]  And they give them the shots, it causes brain damage, and then they call you mentally ill
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:38.120]  when you go to the VA for your treatment. See, and the VA set up to keep tabs on you,
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.960]  and basically, it's just horrendous. Stay there, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:48.760]  So yeah, the guy has migraines, and so they're trying to say he's incompetent because of it.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:54.120]  Unbelievable, sir. There are ways to detox. I got Ben Fuchs coming up, pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:58.040]  We're gonna talk about ways for the detox vets. You got to get off the medication if I was you
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:01.320]  as well. I'm not recommending that, but you should look into it. Stay there.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.800]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.440]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:15.960]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:19.480]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:23.480]  Don't be dependent. Be self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you,
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.360]  feed yourself. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:33.080]  supply of food from e Foods Direct. It's the best long-term, storable food on the planet.

[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:18.680]  electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are. Incompetent line crooks
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:24.040]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high. Some have
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:29.640]  called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:37.000]  deep the conspiracy goes. My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how

[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.520]  You know, a lot of people, I see a comment on infoawards.com says,
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:21.880]  Ghost, it's almost time to head downrange. Lieutenant US Navy Seal 9403. They want you to go
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.480]  downrange. They want the war to start. They're gonna sit back while the military and police all
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:31.320]  kill each other. That's what's so diabolical about the following orders of a foreign occupying army,
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:37.000]  the globalist. The globalists are illegitimate and they're now just sending letters
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.520]  to veterans all over. The phones are just pouring in, the emails are pouring in,
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.680]  the letters are pouring in from others where they're being told, yeah, come turn your guns in.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.000]  And we're just talking to a gentleman in Oklahoma, Will, who's a Marine,
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:58.600]  who they experimented with on with the, and I hear him and it hurts me cuz he's a smart guy,
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.520]  but he's like, I can prove they experimented on me. He probably don't even know it was all
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:05.640]  over the news at the time when they were doing these. I guess it's three rounds they've done.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:09.000]  It's totally illegal. And it's always the doctors that end up saying, no,
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.440]  at first they court martial people and then their lawyers are so dumb they don't know it's illegal
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:18.360]  to give somebody an experimental shot. You can't make the troops take experimental shots.
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.520]  You can only make them take approved shots. And they use the troops like guinea pigs.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:27.000]  And then I've seen them when troops are in wheelchairs with legs blown off.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.440]  And their wife is a teacher or whatever. The CPS will come and take their kids. We had calls
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:37.720]  yesterday saying, well, you probably got mental problems too since your legs are blown off.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:43.800]  You can't have your three kids. And it makes you wanna cry that while they're praising troops on
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.400]  the news, they're targeting them. That's official. I'm not just saying that. So Will,
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:55.320]  you have migraines, you believe from the anthrax shot, which is exactly the kind of stuff it does,
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.640]  including death. Tell me what they did when they came to your house trying to say you're
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.880]  incompetent. Like you're a 100-year-old person who doesn't know who they are.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:09.560]  Right, right. Well, I mean, they basically, when they deem him a full pension on 100%,
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:17.800]  they wanna check full mental capacity and either turn me over to somebody that would
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:23.160]  handle my money for me and my wife and all this. They even went as far as fact to ask her what
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.240]  type of medication she takes as well. Yeah, cuz she's mentally ill now. No, no, no,
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:31.960]  this exactly, no, this is standard. Sir, they were casing you to take your kids. You have kids?
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:38.600]  Yeah, yeah, they were trying. And Alex, I'll tell you what, God bless you because
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:45.560]  I really do appreciate everything you're doing and stand by you 100% on everything you're doing.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:50.280]  And a lot of these people are listening right now, they need to understand that supporting your
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:58.520]  troops is not buying them a drink, is not buying them food. It's recognizing where your country is
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:05.560]  going and listening to what your troops had to say and supporting them that way. We don't want
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:09.960]  you to support us any other way except that way. Yeah, you don't wanna fake pat on the head like
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.480]  you're a dog. And the reason I interrupt so much when you're calling, I've heard the story
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:19.160]  a thousand times. I know what you're gonna say next. Again, your wife is now mentally
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:24.440]  ill. See, they wanna declare you both incompetent to take your kids. They're preying on you.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:31.000]  These are enemy agents with battle plans to destroy your life and you think they're your
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.720]  friend when you're there. Listen, when I had my kids, I learned the first time. The nurse is like,
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:41.160]  sir, will you take this file downstairs for me? I'm gonna talk to your wife real quick.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:44.520]  I'm like, sure, I'll take it down, what, first floor? Yeah, the main nurse? Okay,
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:49.080]  take your time, honey. And my wife's smart. She goes, man, that lady was putting in a computer
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:55.800]  do we have money? Do I beat you? Am I mean to you? And I said, were you putting that in a health
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:59.880]  department computer? And the nurse had those evil eyes. She goes, how do you know that?
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.880]  And I was like, well, obviously, I'm a media person. I know all about this. I know you take
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:07.240]  blood samples at birth and give it to the government. Well, how do you know about that?
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:12.760]  That was before that was declassified. And I said, listen, I said, listen, it's none of your
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:18.280]  business, okay? Is there any outward signs of abuse on my wife? No, you have no probable cause,
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:22.120]  you haven't read us our rights. This is not a law enforcement action. That woman was totally
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.360]  freaked out. And the next time we had a child, same hospital, because the doctor's a listener.
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:30.360]  The woman's another woman's doing and I go, listen, I'm not taking this downstairs. She
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:35.960]  can do your health department thing. Totally freaked her out. I got glasses, lady. I can see.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:50.120]  I know who you are in the me. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.

[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:59.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:12.760]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:21.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:30.360]  In the Soviet systems worldwide and in the Nazi systems, they always use medical tyranny. And
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:33.560]  the reason I'm jumping in so much when there's a caller like this is I know the story.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:38.200]  And now it's accelerating to tell veterans they can't have guns.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:43.560]  And it should be done with the general public as well. What did Alan Dershowitz say? He said,
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.320]  I believe Alex Jones is mentally ill. He should have his guns taken.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:53.400]  I'm afraid of that man. I have no criminal record and almost no misdemeanors.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:00.600]  I mean, I'm angry. I'm letting my anger be seen to try to spur you to get angry,
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:05.880]  to get moving, folks. But we've got Ronald and we've got Tim and we've got Jim and Chad.
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.040]  We'll get to all of you, all vets. But Will, finishing up with you, how did this end? Were
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:15.000]  they able to get your guns? Well, no, they weren't. In fact,
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.720]  you know, my wife, yeah, she takes medications, but it's none of their business what she takes
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:25.080]  the medication for. And I explicitly told them that. Even my wife stepped in and said it.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:27.880]  Well, that's why under Obamacare, they share it with all the agencies now,
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.680]  so they have all the medical records. Right. Well, and so anyway, so that,
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:37.720]  you know, he says, well, we got to put this up for review. And of course, the guy left and
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.080]  got my letter in the mail later on because I kept receipts of everything that I do as far as I pay
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:48.200]  my bills. And my main my main thing why I wanted to call you is to let these vets know that when
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:54.520]  they're getting out, they need to be very, very based on the bonds. Everything they do when they
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:58.520]  pay their bills, they need to keep records of it. They need to. Yeah, because they're going to
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.600]  declare you in compliment. It's like putting you in prison. That's why they wanted to say your wife
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:08.840]  was incompetent. They want to list you basically as a terrorist. God bless you, sir. I got to jump
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:13.080]  to the next caller. Good to hear from you and glad to hear you were smart on the ball. Yeah,
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:18.680]  no, they'll take a Navy Seal or a Green Beret, somebody who was commanding 100 people and on
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:25.640]  the ball at 1000% higher than the gibbering VA, generally some weird foreigner they bring in
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:29.880]  because they hate Americans or whatever. I mean, it's a stereotype, but it's true.
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:34.840]  Eastern Europe, you name it, India, nothing against Indians or people from Eastern Europe.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:39.720]  They'll just bring in folks will do whatever they're told. And so I've talked to all the
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.200]  VA people about what they witnessed. I heard the same story over and over again. And they're just
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.680]  totally incompetent. They'll cut off the wrong leg, give them the wrong medication, but they're
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:54.040]  going to come and tell you, you're mentally ill. You're incompetent. You're a nobody now.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:58.920]  They're a somebody, you're a nobody. Because the truth is they're afraid of people that have
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:05.000]  actually done things in their lives. They hate men. They hate masculinity. They love tyranny,
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.640]  ladies and gentlemen. They are the scum of the earth. They are the enemies of everything good.
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:13.800]  Ronald in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead. Veteran.
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:17.880]  Yeah, sorry. Good evening or afternoon. Excuse me.
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:20.040]  Yeah, you don't know. It is good afternoon. What happened to you? Go ahead.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:27.320]  It's been a long day. Let's put it that way. Yeah, I've actually served back in the 80s in
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:32.760]  the Middle East before we became fashionable. And there was a lot of things that go on that I've
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:38.280]  seen. And that's one of the reasons why I never, they asked me to re-up because I was in the
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:44.520]  special forces, ran my own clinic, yada, yada, happy, happy. And I refused to. I seen what was
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.440]  going on, what we were doing to our own allies, to our own people. And that went against everything
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.480]  ex water protected and uphold on the constitution. Have you gotten one of these letters saying you
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.200]  can't own guns? Not yet, but I haven't checked my mail out today. That's what I was planning
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:05.160]  on doing. You know, statistically, if they send these out to say 10 million vets, you will get a
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:09.080]  couple hundred thousand that start fighting back. That starts the civil war right there.
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:14.520]  Well, the thing is, what a lot of people don't understand, they keep thinking the veterans
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:21.880]  are those older vet. The people in the military will attack too. The US citizens, they're not
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:28.040]  going to. It's going to be those new ones that are currently in that just re-up or just get into
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:33.560]  the service that will have no hesitation about shooting. No, no, the globalists have done the
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:37.640]  actuaries. They know it's going to be the vets that are going to fight for America. And that's
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:44.920]  why you're being listed as the enemy. Oh, exactly. When I went to a VA outpatient clinic in Longview,
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:52.520]  Texas, the physicians there, they were asking me questions that were idiotic, simply for
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:57.960]  some pain medication for a back injury I received. Tell you what, stay there. I've got Ben Peeps

[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:08.360]  of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:13.640]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:19.640]  that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:25.000]  are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped

[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:25.880]  worldwide. It's Alex Jones. All right, one of the most popular guests we have on, pharmacist Ben
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:31.000]  Fuchs will be joining us here in a few minutes. And I wanted to get him on. As I listen to his
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.280]  show, some comes on Genesis, GCNlive.com in the hour before we go live at 12 noon every day
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.560]  Eastern. And I want to get into what are the biggest health issues we need to be thinking
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:45.560]  about today. I've got a bunch of news where they're admitting now aspartame's killing you,
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.360]  giving you cancer, giving you type 2 diabetes. The different chemicals that are in the food and
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:57.240]  water and victories we're having that when we expose it, they remove it. But we need to expose
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:04.120]  it first. Why are we falling apart? What can we do about it? What do we need to supplement?
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.880]  I was reading the comments on Infowars.com in the article federal government moves to
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.440]  disarm veterans. And they're in there commenting, we've been talking to them. They go, yeah, I mean,
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:17.880]  I go in for a sore jaw and they give me hydrocodone. Or I go in for a hurt foot and they
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:25.880]  want to cut the toe off. Or I go in from a car wreck and they want to put me on Luvox or other
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:29.800]  serotonin uptake inhibitors and then declare me mentally ill. And they advertise to them,
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.160]  we'll get you 100% disability if you agree that you've got PTSD.
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:37.560]  And you're like, well, that sounds pretty good. I guess I kind of deserve a free ride.
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:44.360]  But it isn't a free ride. Nobody rides for free. Nobody rides for free. We're gonna play that at
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:52.440]  the bottom of the hour. And expanding on all of this, if you just joined us, the big news,
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:59.640]  federal government moves to disarm veterans. And since I did this, the emails, the calls,
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:04.440]  it's exploding. We got Brian in PA, did receive letters saying, you don't have any second
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:09.240]  amendments, sucker. You've been declared incompetent. Not you've been declared disabled.
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:16.120]  And I had vets calling yesterday going, yeah, I'm physically disabled. I came and took my three
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:22.040]  kids cuz I was in special forces. They said I'm dangerous. Of course they are. They want robots
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:28.120]  they fully control. They're not gonna have humans in combat very soon. That's the official model.
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:32.200]  I have a training video of that with the Air Force showing it. I mean, that's their plan. Whether it
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.160]  works or not, I don't know. And so they're gonna tell you they love you while they try to shoot
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:42.040]  you up with deadly drugs and soft kill your butt. And I really think they've miscalculated.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.400]  But you notice all the dramas and TV shows with the veterans of the new terrorists and
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:51.000]  the training manuals and all of it. This is a really bad federal government run by foreign
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.200]  banks. And that's actually in the news again today, the new bubble and it's the bond bubble.
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:00.120]  And central banks are scared just like Max Keiser said, I hope he isn't right.
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:04.040]  As bad as this system is when it blows up, they're just gonna grab more power and
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:09.160]  call for a bank of the world as they were doing again yesterday. And what funds carbon taxes?
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.720]  And what's the new Secretary of State Kerry say in his first speech two days ago? We need
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:21.320]  that carbon tax to save the earth. A global tax you pay on everything. It's a value added.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:29.640]  Right down through the entire chain. And then on other key items, gas, fuel, electricity, coal,
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:36.280]  plastics, beef, everything with petroleum in it, just hundreds of new taxes.
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.360]  Hundreds, just an absolute straight jacket on our economy.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:47.000]  And there it is, Kerry exploits Obamacare passage to propose carbon tax. And that's
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.200]  from two, three years ago, but now he's the new Secretary of State and that's what he's pushing.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:57.320]  Wow, so I wanted to have that caller Ronald in Texas finish. He was saying
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.720]  he went into the VA over, I forget what he said. And then they were asking him some really crazy
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:05.880]  questions. They're not crazy questions. It's like when you're going to have a baby now,
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.000]  no criminal record, you're paying tens of thousands of dollars, you're at the hospital,
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.800]  your wife's water's broke. This happens nationwide.
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:16.200]  Globally, if you're in Australia, it happens. There's a computer hooked in wired into the
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.600]  health department. It's really the race hygiene department set up in England back in the 1870s
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:26.120]  and 80s here in about 1900, 1910. Race hygiene department, they used to have courts where they
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:29.560]  would just, no jury, they would just take you and sterilize you if they felt like it.
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:32.360]  They really still have those behind the scenes, but it's not as prolific
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:36.520]  because people fought back against it. And again, you're there having your baby and they're like,
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:41.720]  would you mind taking this to the first floor as I said earlier? And you take your file down there
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.120]  and they're like, honey, how you doing on money?
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:48.440]  You doing all right? I'm your friend. You ready? You got to have that baby. I'm your friend.
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:54.120]  How's he treating you? And it's like, he's a jerk. We should have a big fight.
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.520]  Oh, your kids are gone. Of course, you're not telling you that. It's like your friend. Oh,
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.880]  your water broke, sweetie. How much money you got? You doing all right on money?
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:04.520]  If you say you got money troubles, your kids are gone.
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:11.000]  And they're lawless crooks. You understand that? They take your blood, they put it in
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.640]  the Pentagon database, your newborn baby. They sell it to big corporations who patent your DNA.
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.280]  20 years later, you go to have a surgery and a DNA transfusion. They go, sorry,
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.400]  it's gonna be $115,000. Genecore, whatever the name of the company is, they own your DNA.
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:30.520]  It's all just a hardcore savage mafia with a liberal face. Oh, we're sweet. Oh,
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:36.280]  we love you. It's all camouflage. Oh, we're here to help you. Be reasonable. Work with us.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:42.680]  We wanna help you on and on and on and on and on. Finishing with a caller and then pharmacist Ben
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:48.040]  Fuchs and more calls. We're gonna race through a bunch of stuff with Ben here today. Ronald,
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:51.400]  finish your story. So you're going to the VA for what and what happens?
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:14:00.680]  I was injured in the special forces. And here, I went in for my yearly checkup. I also went in to
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:08.680]  get my prescription for non-narcotic pain pills, i.e. Tylenol. It's cheaper than being on disability,
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:15.080]  $700 a month. It's kind of expensive to live. Anyways, they were doing a psych eval
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:22.680]  to the point of, I had less psychological eval questions given to me when I had a top secret
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:28.600]  clearance than what they were asking. Everything from, do I believe in homosexual marriage? Do I
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:32.840]  have ever had homosexual incidents in the military? Yada, yada, on and on and on.
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:39.480]  Well, if you have PTSD, I said, I don't. But you served in combat. And you're not stressed out?
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:45.960]  No. Why should I be? We can get you. I said, no. And it got to the point where the doctor
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:50.600]  tried to humiliate me in the public room saying, oh, well, I think you have tertiary syphilis.
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:58.200]  I said, no, I don't. I said- No, no, her job is to bully you into agreeing and going on medication
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:03.000]  so all your rights go out the window. It is a medical mafia out of control.
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:10.440]  When I worked in the hospital at Walter Reed, I was dressed in my whites. I actually had one
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:15.320]  of the pharmacy corporations come up and offer me a car, a house, a boat, because he thought I
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:18.840]  was a doctor. No, no, same deal. They're like, listen, you've done a really good job. Here's
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:25.080]  your free European trip, your free cruise, and a free car. And that's how they bribe these doctors.
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.160]  Listen, Richard told me he went and saw a movie called Side Effects. The whole thing is how
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:33.800]  the Prozac drugs really aren't hurting people. People are using that as a cover to kill people.
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:37.560]  And it's all just funded by these people. God bless you, sir, good to hear from you.
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:41.800]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, I wanted to intro that. They're now sending veterans everywhere letters
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:45.800]  saying no more gun rights for you. No judge, no jury. They're not even being designated
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:51.320]  as mentally ill. You just heard that bullying story. Last hour, a guy called in saying I had
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:55.720]  PTSD, but I started taking beyond tangy tangerine, and now I'm not freaking out.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:02.120]  Well, it wasn't PTSD. It's like all these behavioral problems. The ADHD,
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:06.760]  you get the kids off red dye and sugar and candy and nerds candy and white bread,
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:10.680]  and they suddenly get good food. And I mean, if I give my kids processed sugar,
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:14.280]  we're out at the event, okay, birthday party, have a piece of cake. They're a demon the rest
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:18.600]  of the day. Don't ever give them cakes and stuff and processed stuff. They're angels.
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:25.320]  I mean, it is like clockwork, ADHD. Give them speed to burn their brain out. Give them
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:30.040]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors. I mean, what do you think from what you just heard?
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:35.880]  Again, you are a natural drug formulator, compounding pharmacist. Before that,
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:39.720]  a mainline pharmacist, one of the most successful there in Colorado. Ben Fuchs
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:45.080]  introduced him for those that don't know who he is. He works and advises us at InfowarsHealth.com
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:48.840]  or InfowarsTeam.com. But what did you just think of what you just heard?
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:52.920]  Yeah, there's so many ways you can go with this. First of all, post-traumatic stress syndrome is
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:57.080]  something that we're all dealing with because we're all being traumatized and we all have
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:02.120]  stress. And even though, according to the World Health Organization, there's 12,000 different
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:07.480]  diseases, there's really only one disease, and that is the disease of traumatic stress.
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:12.280]  And what our veterans are experiencing are an exaggerated version of what we're all
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:17.400]  experiencing, which is why the single most important strategy for restoring yourself back
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:22.520]  to health and wellness is to tell the body via nutritional supplementation, via oxygenation,
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:29.640]  via correct foods, via detoxification, to tell the body that all is okay, that all is right in
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:36.040]  the world. When the body perceives that it is under stress, that there is a trauma that's
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:40.920]  occurring, it will begin to shut down growth processes, healing processes, and repair
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:47.240]  processes. And if we wanted to design a society that was systematically, specifically set up to
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.440]  cause stress and trauma and shut down the growth and repair system, we couldn't do a better job
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:57.000]  if we tried to do it intentionally. And we very well might be doing it intentionally. Fluoride
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  in the water, preservatives in foods, excitotoxins, processed breads and grains, purified
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:10.200]  sugars, these all exacerbate the stress response in the body. When the body is under stress,
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:12.600]  it doesn't do its best work. It doesn't heal. It doesn't grow.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:15.800]  Well, let's start with this. What would you do with vets that they've got on serotonin
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:21.080]  reuptake inhibitors who have not eaten good food, who are on 700 bucks a month, all these
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:25.880]  special forces heroes that the government hates so much, but says they're heroes all day.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:28.600]  What would you begin to do if you were one of those guys?
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:34.360]  First and foremost, I would have these people activating their relaxation chemistry. The body's
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:39.560]  got two kinds of chemistry. It's got relaxation chemistry and it has stress chemistry. And for
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:44.680]  the vast majority of our chemistry needs to be in the relaxation mode. The stress mode is only
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:49.160]  for emergencies. So we got to figure out, not just for our vets, for all of us, we have to figure out
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:54.360]  how to access this relaxation chemistry. And the good news is it's not expensive. The good news is
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:59.160]  you can do it for free. But the system won't tell you. They get into a stressed economy,
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:02.840]  we all do it, especially professionals, and then they can never get out of it.
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.440]  You've got to learn how to get into a joking economy. That's why I do that sometimes.
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:10.600]  You've got to learn to go out and have fun as well. And they don't want people to know there's
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.720]  a cure. I'll tell you one of the simplest, easiest ways to activate relaxation chemistry,
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:20.600]  the biggest emergency to the body is lack of oxygen. It's technically called hypoxia,
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:25.080]  low levels of oxygen. When the body gets low levels of oxygen, it feels like its death is
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:30.520]  imminent. Anytime I get down, I just go out and climb a mountain. Something as simple as exercise
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:34.680]  and deep breathing techniques can send the message, the biochemical message to the body
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:39.160]  that all is right in the world and can begin to activate the relaxation response and the
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:43.400]  healing and growth and repair response. For folks who are dealing with PTSD, just experiment,
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:48.040]  try this. Deep breathing techniques for 60 seconds, it won't cost you anything.
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:51.720]  And in 60 seconds, your blood pressure will drop, your blood will start to thin,
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:56.360]  you'll get more nutrients to your organs. Let's all deep breathe during the break. Let's do it.
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:11.240]  I'm serious, folks. Let's all deep breathe. The New World Order hates it. We'll be right back.
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:41.240]  Let's all deep breathe. Let's all deep breathe. Let's all deep breathe.
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:00.520]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:06.120]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device is smaller
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:10.920]  than a coffee cup fakes up burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away,
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:16.600]  plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:22.840]  Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 US homes will have a break in,
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:28.280]  with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:34.120]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:39.560]  simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing. And for
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:45.160]  only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:55.160]  that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388.
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:00.280]  Or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:05.080]  Naggin constipation, hemorrhoids or painful bowel movements? Have you considered your toilet
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:09.960]  posture? The colon needs proper alignment for faster, more effective elimination. And that's
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:14.360]  exactly what you'll get with a squatty potty, not a cleanse or a pill. The squatty potty is
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:19.240]  a healthy step in the right direction, is doctor recommended, and starts at just $34.95. Call
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:27.080]  855-628-1099 or go to squattypotty.com. Spelled S-Q-U-A-T-T-Y potty dot com.
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:32.200]  Squatty potty, healthy colon, happy life. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:36.840]  why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:41.800]  since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:46.600]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:53.000]  for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns,
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:59.640]  call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:07.720]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all
[02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:14.680]  amenities, wi-fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits. After a good night's sleep,
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:22.360]  your adventure begins. You're on a golden stag safari for big game. But it's not Africa,
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:29.720]  it's Argentina. One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar,
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:37.800]  and the biggest stag deer in South America. All gold metal quality. All the action you can handle.
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:43.080]  Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides,
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:48.200]  ground transportation included, and more. All more affordable than you can imagine.
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:53.960]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:24:00.760]  The big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:13.000]  Nope, that's why under the name of liberalism, they promote nothing but racial division on MSNBC
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:22.120]  and CNN. All they want us to do is go on killing one another. Coming up in the next segment,
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:25.640]  I'm gonna hit a few news stories before we go back to Ben Fuchs and your calls.
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:29.480]  Like Obama administration moves forward on climate change without Congress.
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:33.720]  That means shutting down our power plants and not letting new ones be opened.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:38.840]  When you take over a country like in World War II that you fly in and bomb the power plants.
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:44.200]  Folks, they're gonna make you poor, they're gonna make you go on government assistance
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:50.840]  so they can run your life like these veterans. And I see the first commenter in this article
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:54.680]  in US News and World Report that's linked on Drudge. How stupid is it to kill off
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:57.800]  the energy source without a replacement? Liberals never see the big picture when
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:03.800]  it has to do with technology and numbers. No, it's not about not seeing the big picture.
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:09.320]  They're not liberals. The globalists have all moved their investments to China who has no
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.720]  standards. They're increasing the value of their investments by shutting us down.
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.320]  Just like General Electric gets waivers on all this domestically, they can have new plants and
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:24.760]  expand old plants and put out all the CO2 they want. But everybody else has to cut it in half,
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:29.160]  which is impossible. I'm sorry, Ben Fuchs going back to you, brother.
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.560]  So for vets out there, and we'll get into all this other news.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:38.840]  Breathing exercises, basic exercise, not eating MSG, not eating aspartame.
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.960]  I mean, just the whole society is falling apart. It's all coming out even CBS News.
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:50.120]  Oh, aspartame does give you diabetes. You were talking about that on the show a month ago, Ben.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:53.640]  So here's the idea. There's this notion that to take care of yourself and to
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.040]  stay healthy, it's going to cost you a lot of money. It's going to take a lot of work.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:03.160]  The message that I want people to understand is it is simple and easy to restore your body
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:08.360]  back to health because it's in the body's nature to heal. Every time you cut yourself,
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:11.880]  you are witness to this healing process. You don't have to think about it. You don't have to
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:16.440]  take any special potions. You don't need any prescription drugs. The skin just does its duty.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:22.360]  It heals itself. When you break a bone, the place where you broke it is stronger after it heals
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:28.120]  than it was before it broke. Not only is it in the body's nature to heal itself, it's in the body's
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:33.080]  nature to get stronger when it is under certain amounts of stress. This is how exercise works.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.440]  Now they're trying to get rid of vaginal birth. Someday it'll be a conspiracy
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:39.160]  that women ever had babies, period. They'll be grown in tanks.
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:43.160]  Let me tell you about the disaster of cesarean sections. When a baby is born,
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:49.000]  he is coated with bacteria, and that bacteria become that baby's personal microbiome for
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.280]  producing vitamins and detoxifying food and processing anything that the kid eats for the
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:59.080]  rest of his life. A baby that's born non-vaginally through cesarean section is going to be
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:03.960]  compromised at the digestive system level for life. He's going to be running higher risks for
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:08.440]  degenerative disease, and this is a baby that's going to be forced to interact with the medical
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.120]  doctor. They don't want him getting the colostrum that is every immunity the woman in her entire
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.520]  genetic line had, an entire vaccination all the way back to the beginning of humanity.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.520]  Don't get that either. That's right, and how many babies, how many mothers are told to give
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:25.240]  their babies formula because there's not enough nutrients in breast milk? I just got a Facebook
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.240]  message from a guy who said just that. He went to the doctor. The doctor said, well, breast milk's
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:35.400]  okay, but there's not enough nutrients in it. We need to give your baby a B12 and fluoride
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:42.040]  injection. Folks, this is not only stupidity and bad science and bad biochemistry. It's killing us.
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:47.320]  It's costing us our quality of life. It's so tragic and it's so unnecessary. If you do things
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:51.480]  like number one, practice deep breathing. Number two, get on a nutritional supplement program.
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:57.000]  Number three, not interacting with the corporate domesticating food, the food that gets us fat and
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.040]  the food that keeps us dumb and stupid. Simple things like that can restore ourselves back to
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:07.240]  health because it's the way the body is constructed. It's the divine force at work,
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:11.800]  and it doesn't need our help. It simply needs raw materials to do its work.
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:20.120]  Amazing. Now, my neck, my face, my arms, my legs have all gotten smaller, but I don't follow the
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.960]  whole Infowarshealth.com, the longevity program. I'm trying to. My belly has stayed the same size,
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:30.680]  and a lot of evidence is I guess I'm still eating gluten, and I guess I've got the wheat belly.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.440]  You know, it's a stress response that we're talking about. To the body, there's only two
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:39.480]  kinds of stresses, Alex. There's the stress of being eaten by a saber-toothed tiger or a lion,
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:43.560]  and there's the stress of starvation. So what the body will do when it's under stress, and it
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.680]  doesn't know that there's stress from the government and stress from the IRS and stress
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:50.840]  from our families and stress from our foods. It just thinks we're going to be eaten by a tiger
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:56.040]  or we're going to starve. So number one, it will send us out on a one-pointed hunt for food,
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:01.320]  and it'll put that food on our bellies. It'll store it as fat, and it won't allow us to lose
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:05.720]  that fat because it thinks a famine is about to approach. Number two, it's going to activate the
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:09.880]  chemistry that will protect us from being eaten by a saber-toothed tiger. Number one, it's going
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:16.920]  to divert blood from the digestive system and from the brain into the legs so that we can run.
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:20.840]  And number two, it's going to clot the blood, and it's going to cause hypertension so we don't
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:24.840]  bleed to death. And when you think about it, all of the diseases that we're suffering from,
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:29.400]  all the degenerative diseases that we're suffering from are the result of lack of circulation,
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:35.240]  stagnation, blood clotting, obesity, and, oh, by the way, you can throw in a shrinking of the
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:39.160]  brain, the intellectual centers of the brain, and a slowing down of the immune system.
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:45.560]  There was a big study on that, geneticists, where the IQ is dropping across the world.
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:49.160]  No surprise. No surprise, Alex. Stay there.

[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:34.920]  who tries to stay away from the GMO. Well, I mean, the general public's eating GMO, Aspartame,
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:41.960]  artificial sweeteners, the McDonald's food and others has the silicone in it.
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:45.640]  I mean, what they can get away with putting in food. All this is out there now.
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:51.880]  Our longevity is dropping, the cancer is exploding, the diabetes, all of this and
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:56.600]  society is falling apart. What would you begin with? I'm going to give you the floor right now
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:59.800]  for the next 10 minutes before we go to calls and news. What would you go through?
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:04.120]  What are our biggest health issues and what exactly is wrong with the medical model? Why
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.000]  are we falling apart? What can we do about it? Why do we need to supplement? What does weight
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.960]  loss occur as a byproduct of supplementation? What is the problem with fluoride? You've got
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:18.600]  the floor. All right, the biggest problem that we're dealing with is what you've been talking
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:22.760]  about for the last couple hours, this idea of post-traumatic stress syndrome.
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:28.200]  Post-traumatic stress syndrome simply means that we're stressed after trauma. From birth
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:33.800]  forward, the human body is attacked with things like fluoride in the water, excitotoxins in the
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:40.040]  food, nutritionally deficient foods, sugar, et cetera, et cetera. Not to mention pharmaceutical
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:46.840]  drugs and deadly medical procedures. It makes perfect sense that we would all be dealing with
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.880]  a type of post-traumatic stress. So the first and most important thing we can do if we're
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:57.320]  dealing with a degenerative disease or to prevent degenerative disease is to figure out how to tell
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:03.480]  the body that we are safe, that everything is okay from a survival standpoint. And the first
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:08.520]  thing you need to do or we need to do is understand the breathing processes we talked about before.
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:15.240]  The biggest emergency to the body from a physical standpoint is lack of oxygen. Over time, as we
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:21.640]  are bombarded with stress, we begin to contract our body. And by the time we're in our 20s or
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:28.040]  30s, we're filled with these microscopic little contractions that are pools of hypoxia, pools of
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:33.000]  low oxygen. And these pools of low oxygen accumulate, and the body over time believes that
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.560]  it's about to die. So the first and most important thing we can do to activate the body is relax
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:43.400]  the body's relaxation chemistry, healing chemistry, built-in healing chemistry is to deep breathe and
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:47.720]  to blow off carbon dioxide. I don't want to beat this to death, but that's probably the single
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:52.840]  most important thing we can do. The second most important thing we can do is to figure out how
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:59.960]  to eat less calories and get more nutrients. The average American diet is the exact opposite. It's
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:04.200]  more calories and less nutrients. And you and I have talked about this before. When the body
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:10.040]  gets calories without nutrients, it continues being hungry. We have a shutoff center in our
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:15.560]  brain, an appetite suppressant center in our brain. And this appetite suppressant center in
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:23.240]  the brain is dependent on nutrients and protein, and to a certain extent fats as well. So making
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:26.760]  sure that you're getting enough protein, making sure you're getting enough fats in the form of
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:31.640]  essential fatty acids and saturated fats, by the way, like coconut oil, and making sure that
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.600]  you're getting enough micronutrients is the second most important strategy that you can use.
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:40.680]  And not only is it an important strategy for helping turn on the relaxation chemistry,
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:46.200]  but it's a wonderful strategy for building your immune system and allowing your body to lose
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:51.160]  weight naturally. In fact, as you know, one of the most common effects of nutritional supplementation
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:54.840]  with the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Young Jeopardy products is weight loss. And we don't
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.480]  even talk about weight loss as being a benefit from using the Beyond Tangy Tangerine. It's just
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:06.040]  a natural effect of nutritional supplementation. The third most important strategy that we can use
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:13.240]  is to refuse to interact with the corporate machine that could care less about our health.
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:19.000]  Your doctor, the medical model, the corporate medical model, corporate food, these people
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:26.120]  could care less whether we live or die, as long as they extract our money. To refuse to interact
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:33.160]  with the McDonald's of the world, the Taco Bell's of the world, the Kaiser's of the world. To refuse
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:38.840]  to participate in their scam is the third most important strategy that we can use. And let me
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:43.800]  tell you something, when we drive, when we pass by McDonald's, we don't want to be driving through,
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:47.880]  we want to be driving by. And as we're driving by, we want to be giving them the finger because
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:53.560]  they are truly the enemy of humanity. And if we participate in eating the fast food and eating
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:58.760]  the corporate swill and not supplementing using a nutritional supplement, nutritional supplement
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:06.120]  program, we are complicit in our own demise. The third thing, drink more water, clean water,
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:11.400]  filtered water, and stay away from toxic fluoride, whether it's in the form of toothpaste or whether
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:16.120]  it's in the form of drinking water. One of the most insidious ways that we pollute, that
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:21.400]  humanity is being polluted is by fluoride in the drinking water for babies. If you go to
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:28.920]  Walgreens or these drugs, Rite Aid, drugstores and convenience stores, you'll find nursery water,
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:36.360]  which is packed with fluoride. How a mother can voluntarily give their baby toxic fluoride in
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:41.560]  this in- I gotta stop you on this cuz you're nice and say they may be doing it on purpose.
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:46.120]  They're eugenicists. I've got all the globalists bragging how we deserve it. The Journal of
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:51.560]  Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association were forced
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:58.360]  six years ago to say that under five should not drink fluoride and should not brush with fluoride
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:04.920]  because they had to admit the cancer and the dental fluorosis. It is a fact that it reduces
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:10.360]  IQ. And they put huge amounts, like three or four parts per million in that. And we forced them what
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:17.000]  last year to finally cut it from 1.3 to 0.7 parts per, what is it, million or billion.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:23.080]  They had to cut basically in half the amount, a little bit more than half of what they put
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:28.520]  in the water. And they're banning it as a pesticide now because it bioaccumulates. I mean,
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:35.000]  this is the ultimate hoax. This chemical weapon in the hydrofluorosolic acid range,
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.160]  which makes the sodium fluoride, which you do need a tiny amount of, hyper poisonous and cumulative
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.400]  and stick in your bones. I mean, come on, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, that's on purpose.
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:50.200]  Well, one of the best ways to protect ourselves from fluoride is to make sure you're getting
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:54.920]  enough nutritional supplements, especially iodine, especially vitamin C, and especially vitamin E.
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.960]  And by the way, this whole notion of iodized salt and all we need is a tiny little bit of iodine in
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:05.640]  our salt and we won't get glitter is another health scan that does disservice to the human
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:10.600]  race. Iodine is not just a thyroid hormone, it's a critical hormone for the pineal gland,
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:15.400]  which is like a fluoride vacuum cleaner. If you're getting fluoride and you're giving your kids
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:20.360]  fluoride and you're not getting enough iodine, you are guaranteeing that your pineal gland will
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:26.360]  be shrunk in an atrophy like an old man by the time you or your kid is 10 or 12 years old.
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:30.280]  So making sure that you're taking care of nutritional supplements is once again,
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:35.080]  one of the best ways to protect yourself against toxicity. By the way, when it comes to water,
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:39.720]  there's not just fluoride in the water Alex, there's measurable amounts of cardiovascular
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:45.560]  medications, of calcium channel blockers, and of antidepressants and other psychotropic
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:50.440]  medications in the water. I was just reading an article this morning that talked about fish
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:58.040]  having autism genes turned on by swimming in water that has antipsychotic and anti-medication,
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:03.880]  antidepressant medication in it. Literally, fish have genes, autism genes, and those genes get
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:09.720]  turned on by having the fish swimming in antidepressant-laden water. And this is the
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:13.480]  kind of stuff that we're drinking. Not to mention if you go ahead and voluntarily take an
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:19.240]  antidepressant or an antipsychotic drug. And this whole idea, by the way, of Prozac and serotonin
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:23.640]  reuptake inhibitors is one of the biggest scandals in a whole litany of scandals of-
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:27.720]  Yeah, let me stop you for just a moment because this is so incredible. Last week,
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:32.360]  Melissa Melton on the Nightly News covered the London Guardian, big studies, headlined
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:37.800]  fish committing suicide because of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the water. They will swim
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:42.760]  right up to bigger fish and be eaten. They will swim right up into people's nets. And what did
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:49.640]  they report five years ago in a federal study? Shrimp committing suicide because of Prozac.
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:59.880]  Prozac-type drugs, but here's the deal. They're finding a generic form of Prozac in water supplies
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:04.600]  at levels higher than it should be even for runoff, Ben. They're jacking the water with
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:09.000]  Prozac. There it is, pharmacological waste runoff causing shrimp and other marine life to commit
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.600]  suicide. Now, that's from 2012. You guys have got to pull up. I remember the exact headline,
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:19.560]  like fish committing suicide on Prozac. I mean, of course. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:24.680]  You hit the nail on the head with those two words. Of course, we cannot expect anything to be
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:28.440]  different. Look, if you're on a prescription medication, if anybody out there is on a
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:33.160]  prescription medication, take that medication and instead of swallowing it, chew it. Let that
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:38.440]  medication hit your taste buds in your tongue. It will taste like the most toxic, repulsive
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:43.720]  poison you could ever imagine. And the reason is, it is the most toxic, repulsive poison
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:47.240]  that you could ever imagine. And the fact that you're taking it in small enough doses
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:53.800]  that you don't notice a big time emergency poison response doesn't make that stuff less poisonous.
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:44:01.080]  How can we have a healthcare system manned by healthcare professionals who are sworn to do no
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:08.440]  harm that lives and subsists and does its work by poisoning people purportedly back to health?
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:14.120]  Where does this notion come from that we can pharmaceuticalize ourselves back to health and
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:19.320]  wellness? Alex, the word pharmaceutical itself, pharmaco comes from the root word for what?
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:25.400]  Poison. You're literally, if we are taking these medications and there's 4 billion of them,
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:31.320]  prescriptions served every year annually in this country alone and untold billions around the
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:37.560]  world, if we voluntarily participate in taking these poisons, we are complicit in our own demise.
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:43.720]  And folks, let me tell you something, nutrients are what drugs dream they could be. When a drug
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:49.560]  goes to bed at night and has a fantasy, it fantasizes it's vitamin C or vitamin E or
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:54.040]  vitamin A because these substances have the medicinal properties of the pharmaceutical
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:45:00.200]  agents with zero toxicity zippos. Zero. They keep trying to find people who die or have some kind of
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:06.440]  toxic response to nutrients and they can't find them because it never happens. Yet we want to
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:11.080]  have more and more regulation on nutrients. We want to have, in the coming years we probably
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:16.920]  will have, doctors tell us what kind and how much vitamins and nutrients we could take and let me
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:21.000]  tell you something. That's what they're pushing through the whole UN deal. That's official.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.560]  Codex thing, that's exactly right. And in some countries it's already started. In Germany and
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:30.280]  in Canada and in France, you can only get small amounts of vitamin C. You can only get small
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:34.200]  amounts of vitamin A. And if you want more, you gotta have a doctor officially write you
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:38.680]  a prescription. And while we're on the subject- Yeah, Merck's now coming out just a few days ago,
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:43.080]  officially saying, you don't just need vaccines to be mandatory. Everyone needs to be on
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:47.560]  antidepressants. I mean, there's no end to the cuckoo-ness of these people.
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:54.440]  It's cuckoo, right? It's absolutely nuts. But you know what, Alex? We have to take responsibility
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:46:01.320]  for our own health. We have to cease and desist from this abdication of responsibility for our
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:06.120]  health and wellness. I agree. Where should people start? Obvious plug. We sell what we believe in.
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:10.200]  You're purchasing great products at infohorsehealth.com and infohorseteam.com that
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:15.960]  Ben has worked on and is advising us on. Helps fund our operation. What products should people
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.280]  start out with? Yeah. Let me ask you a simple question. How many people have you talked to
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:23.720]  in the last two years or two and a half years that you've been doing this that have told you
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:28.280]  that they got on the BTT and their life changed? How many people, all right? I've been hearing it
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:33.000]  since 1997. I don't even call for it on air. We had a guy calling today about it.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.320]  It happens all the time. They lose weight. They feel better. They're off their medication. I
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:40.840]  can't tell you how many letters I've got from people who said that they started the beyond
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:45.480]  tangy tangerine and they're off their medication. And that's just one product. If you want to just
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:50.520]  see for yourself, just you're a little skeptical and I like people who are skeptical. I'm skeptical
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:55.960]  myself. Get yourself on the beyond tangy tangerine. Go to infohorsehealth.com. Check
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:01.720]  it out for yourself. If you're like most people, you will notice results in one or two doses.
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:11.800]  Absolutely. Infohorsehealth.com. You can also call 888-789-9277. That's 888-789-9277,
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:18.280]  888-789-9277. I want to go back in the next segment and go to Brian, a vet who did receive
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:22.440]  letters saying he can't have his guns and Chad and Jim and a few others who are holding patiently.
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:26.200]  We will get to you gentlemen. So thank you for holding and sorry it's taken so long. We had a

[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:05.560]  But let me hit a few news items before we go to break and we'll come back with pharmacist
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.040]  Ben Fuchs on the other side. I promise to do this. So let's go over some of these headlines here.
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:22.680]  Paypal resignation linked to inquiry into Vatican gay officials says paper.
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:27.480]  Yeah, and pedophilia folks. Pub staff declined to confirm or deny
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:36.200]  La Republica claims linking Vatican links affair and discovery of blackmailed gay clergy.
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:42.360]  Yeah, that's how they control and manipulate things. Health of Hugo Chavez not improving
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:50.200]  Venezuelan government indicates Russian meteorite fragments seized from local man
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:55.080]  trying to sell them online. I thought under common law even in Russia, that would be your property.
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.560]  Government people find dinosaur bones on their own property and government comes and steals them now.
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:04.680]  Berlusconi's last throw the dice in Italian election, what a gangster.
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:11.640]  Public schools installing panic buttons. Instead of getting teachers who can be armed with a
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:16.360]  concealed carry, teacher gonna kill people are coming up with a gun anyways. Instead of that,
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:20.280]  no, no, no, they're gonna put panic buttons and so you can all crouch down when there's a shooter
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:25.160]  and hit the panic button and help the police get there in 10 minutes. So basically learn how to die.
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:29.480]  Maybe you can learn to stand up and put a red spray paint on yourself.
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:35.000]  Detroit tops 2013 list of America's most miserable cities. Now that's NAFTA and
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:40.120]  GATT and deindustrialization. But Obama says it's good to bulldoze half the city, it's for the earth.
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:44.440]  Rewilding but not in China where the globalist have their investments.
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:49.480]  Philadelphia chef plans to introduce horse meat to menu at popular Sicilian restaurant.
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:53.640]  Again, everybody's obsessing over fake fish that isn't fish or is a different fish or
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:59.400]  not getting real beef. Yeah, that's horrible. But that's nothing compared to bromine and Gatorade.
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:05.800]  Or aspartame and 10,000 plus products just in major studies. Why is diabetes up
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:11.800]  34,000% in Hispanics? Something like 500% in whites, about 1000% in blacks.
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.320]  Folks, I mean, there are genetic differences in different groups of humans. We're all the same
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:21.800]  race, but there's different variances. Just like whatever it is with the Asians that cross the
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:27.320]  Bering Strait land bridge, that's what Mesoamericans are, is we're Asians.
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:33.400]  Or basically like Huns that cross. The point is, is that it's the same thing. Genetically,
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:39.800]  Asians, especially Native Americans, that strain cannot drink like other ethnic groups.
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:48.200]  Well, it's the same thing. What alcohol absolutely devastates Asians and the North American,
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:53.400]  South American, Central American variant. And so that's what I've told you. If you're Hispanic,
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:51:10.360]  which is Spanish, North African slash Asian mix, you never want to touch aspartame.
[02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:28.840]  media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element. It is the

[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:04.440]  My name is Stephen Heuer. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:09.400]  most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So whether it
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:14.040]  is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more serious matters like inability
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:19.080]  to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's brain working optimally
[02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:23.240]  needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number one means of
[02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:28.520]  detoxification which is glutathione production. My name is Angie and my son has suffered from
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:34.520]  borderline autism and constipation. I got him on One World Way and in two months his constipation
[02:53:34.520 --> 02:53:39.400]  is gone. He has become friendlier. He can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made
[02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:44.760]  his first friend. He's doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. You
[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:51.480]  could offer him a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way. Go to oneworldway.com.
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:54:07.960]  That's one world w-h-e-y dot com or call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325.
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:42.440]  All right here's how this works. For about 12 years I did three hours of radio 11 to 2 central,
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:49.800]  12 noon to 3 p.m eastern and then I always had more to cover so for about three years
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:55.720]  I did a fourth hour and then I did that fourth hour for a couple years. I was sort of doing
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:00.280]  the nightly news and trying to manage all these things and I just it was it was taking all my
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:06.360]  energy so I cut back the fourth hour but still stations were carrying it and so I started you
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:11.720]  know still doing it part of the time or at least part of it and XM said we can't carry four hours
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:17.160]  we'll carry your second third and fourth. Well really that's not the live hour so XM figured
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:21.240]  that out and said well we'll try to figure out how to pick up your first hour now at 11 a.m
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:25.320]  but that hasn't happened yet so people need to let XM know you're subscribing
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:34.520]  on 166 to be able to hear this show and that you want to hear the first hour but a lot of
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:38.760]  our affiliates do carry the fourth hour because they can't carry the first because of shows they
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:43.000]  already have so it's the first hour a lot of times the best my most focused and cogent
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:46.920]  is then re-aired in the fourth hour most days but a lot of days I go into that fourth hour it's
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:52.040]  kind of a specialty hour. I'm gonna have Ben Fuchs because the guy's amazing and he really knows his
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:58.280]  stuff cover the gut the heart the skin the serotonin reuptake inhibitors first I'm gonna
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:03.000]  let him have the floor at about 10 minutes into the next hour I'll introduce him and stuff and
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:08.600]  let him roll and then if he wants to take calls or something too we could do that I've got some
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:13.960]  vets that are holding right now so let's get to them a vet named Brian in Pennsylvania said he
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:20.280]  did receive the letters again if you just joined us the vets are being told no judge no jury if
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:24.840]  you're just if you have visibility even if it's physical we're going to take your kids that's
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:31.320]  already starting the CPS is and they try to say that your wife's disabled so they can take them
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:35.880]  and not even let your family have them so they're targeting the vets in a criminal purge this is
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:40.920]  this is like Jews disappearing and it's like well you know they deserve it or whatever they're
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.600]  targeting the the the veterans that's normally what communists do I mean this is this has happened
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:54.360]  all over the world and so Brian bad news here it's all up at info wars.com we've got to have this
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.840]  story in these letters that we've confirmed go viral they're just saying hey you don't have a
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:03.240]  second amendment anymore as Rahm Emanuel promised tell us what happened to you Brian

[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:23.400]  uh things like that uh they put me on crazy crazy amounts of drugs and drug combinations
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:29.000]  where I was thinking crazier things than even when I was deployed think about John Wayne you
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.800]  know his character but I mean I got a lot of fights growing up it's not mentally ill to get

[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:50.520]  for the entire 20 years that I was in the Marine Corps all of a sudden I was no longer
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:56.840]  competent to handle my finances I was no longer competent to have weapons they actually were
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:03.560]  withholding about fifty thousand dollars in back pay that they owed me for my until my wife signed

[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:09.000]  45 minutes to ben fuchs because this medical stuff is important uh and we're talking about
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:13.320]  stuff we're selling as well that's that's only part of it but that's what funds us so
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:19.560]  infowarshealth.com see that's why i interrupt sometimes when somebody's talking because i'll
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:22.920]  know they don't know the stuff i know and it's frustrating i want to go let me guess and then
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.880]  this happened yeah how'd you know because the globalists are following handbooks somebody
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:32.760]  can call me from england or australia or germany of what they're going through with government and
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:36.920]  i go and let me guess then this happened they're like yeah how do you know that because it's not
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:46.920]  hard it's an it's a playbook it's a manual it's standard operating procedure and they're trying
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:53.000]  to demonize the veterans it is so it just proves how criminal these people are and we don't want
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:57.640]  this civil war to take place by the way the globalists are still going forward with their

[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:17.160]  in the eyes of a wounded warrior images of one hanging his head chaos amongst the living carrying
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:24.360]  the dead once bitten twice shy ready to live and ready to die storming on the inside bullets flying
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:30.760]  where i hide dilated pupils heart pounding distilling in my gut tension mounting floating
[03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:36.840]  metal dropping fire indiscriminate blood under the tire these events arranged forever changed
[03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:43.480]  welcome back mind re-arranged controlled mind blood splatters red cross message loved one's
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:49.640]  heart shatter happy war machine pockets got fatter thoughts of the mundane driving pain it's insane
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:55.880]  suit and tie sent us to die for a lie dredge excuses creating this mess abandon little boy
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:12:01.880]  consciousness penny less well-being thrown in the ditches polluted humanity for false riches
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:06.520]  trading your guilt and shame for camera fame manipulated words war is a lame state of mind
[03:12:06.520 --> 03:12:13.000]  not a game executive decision to kill please forgive me heaven have thy will that's it
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:18.520]  all right well what do you think the veterans are going to do is they're told that they are
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:24.280]  quote incompetent and told your wife has to run your finances or maybe she's mentally ill too
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:29.320]  and we're going to take your kids and they've done nothing and now they're the hunted ones
[03:12:29.320 --> 03:12:35.720]  and homeland security was always shut up for them well i think that the first amendment
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:40.840]  is our freedom of speech our right to assembly and if we are taking that if that one is taken
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:45.800]  away we have the second amendment and that's what i think about that spoken like an american also
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:50.920]  now known as a terrorist thank you for the call and again it's it's it's it's former military
[03:12:50.920 --> 03:12:56.360]  mainly their police who are now going to go harass the the military and then as soon as they're done
[03:12:56.360 --> 03:13:03.400]  with you cops are going to take your guns too and it it's just incredible that i've known for 11
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:08.040]  years homeland security was set up for the troops i've known that and i've said that i've put it in
[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:13.560]  films and i've warned you and i've broken it down and i've studied authoritarianism i'm not patting
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:20.520]  myself on the back my point is this is real and we have ruthless globalists that 13 years ago and
[03:13:20.520 --> 03:13:25.640]  99 signed deals that were in bloomberg a few years ago and ap where the death of the people
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:28.760]  were the death benefits of troops where they tell you oh sign here to have some of your
[03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:32.760]  check taken out for life insurance for your family they signed a deal with prudential and
[03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:37.640]  others just to take all that money and they said well we got it we got the veterans affairs to
[03:13:37.640 --> 03:13:42.520]  agree and that's why they can say we're going to hold up your back pay until you agree to say you
[03:13:42.520 --> 03:13:46.760]  have a psychological problem and go on these drugs we're going to catch you to make sure you're on
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:52.280]  those drugs you're like well i want my 50,000 or i want my 100,000 in some cases you know all the
[03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:56.360]  back pay you've been saving or whatever by the way if you're in the military take every dime
[03:13:56.360 --> 03:14:00.600]  of it now and don't invest in any of their investment deals you're never going to see it
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:07.960]  any of it okay you understand that and again this is not part of some military butt kissing
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:11.880]  operation military knows when they're out there doing checkpoints and being part of it i'm in
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:16.760]  their face but it really makes me sick watching the military being abused like this while the
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:21.000]  very people doing it talk about how much they love the military that's their cover like liberals say
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:27.640]  they're liberals they're authoritarian eugenicists who created the nazis these are people that are
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:33.400]  into how humans work and controlling us and gaming us they're con artists with a science plan
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:40.120]  and a propaganda core but none of their fancy garbage matters anymore when you know they're
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:47.080]  the enemy you understand that once you understand the score and their tricks they only run about 15
[03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:53.000]  different tricks you know the play i've seen the card man i know what you're up to now i'm turning
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:58.120]  the rest of this hour over to pharmacist ben fuchs who was with me as a guest but he's such a good
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:02.120]  talk show host joining us via video skype i'm going to turn it over to him but first here's
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:05.960]  a report jakari jackson just did that was going to air on the nightly news tonight but i thought
[03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:10.840]  why not just air this now uh because it gets into the veteran situation and kind of boils it all
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:17.720]  down some of the backstory because you know drudge is linked to the article about um about you know
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:23.240]  the current thing and which is great our info wars.com article that we you know discovered what
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:27.240]  drudge was covering we then wrote an article just adding some of the history of this to it at
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:31.960]  info wars.com so go check out the drugs report.com link on the left-hand side then go and all the
[03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:36.600]  gun grabbing news then go check out our link with the backstory history on it but right now let's
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:51.880]  go ahead and go to this clip uh here it is with jakari jackson i'm jakari jackson for the info
[03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:56.600]  wars nightly news with all the pro-military coverage in the media it also flies under the
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:16:01.480]  radar that veterans are viewed as the new terror threat we've seen the use of timothy mcveigh and
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:07.320]  others used to demonize all veterans pushing the image of the angry disgruntled vet charging them
[03:16:07.320 --> 03:16:11.800]  with felonies and labeling them terrorists for doing things such as investigating surveillance
[03:16:11.800 --> 03:16:16.120]  cameras and demanding the rights that they fought to protect homeland security has lumped
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:22.520]  servicemen in with quote right-wing extremists and using what can best be described as bunk science
[03:16:22.520 --> 03:16:27.560]  veterans are having their right to bear arms taken away even the boy scouts have run simulations on
[03:16:27.560 --> 03:16:33.000]  how to brutalize quote disgruntled veterans telling a veteran that they are too traumatized by the
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:37.320]  military experience to own a gun it's like disarming a robbery victim because they are
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:41.720]  too traumatized by their home invasion now while i do agree that there are some veterans that may
[03:16:41.720 --> 03:16:46.600]  not be the most sound of mind and body you can say that of any in the american population
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:53.000]  regardless of occupation race sex location or any other of many factors and it's not always
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:58.280]  demonizing vets groups have worked behind the scenes to take away death benefits trample
[03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:03.000]  religious freedoms and even charge soldiers for the medals that they earned we've heard the
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:06.920]  anecdote that soldiers of old would roll over in their graves if they had to deal with this kind
[03:17:06.920 --> 03:17:11.160]  of treatment but the fact is that many veterans roll out of bed every day having to deal with

[03:18:13.320 --> 03:18:20.120]  talk about the glory and the greatness of the human body despite the fact that it seems like
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:25.160]  we are falling apart americans are the sickest culture in the history of the planet despite the
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:30.040]  fact that we have the highest health care costs and more doctors per capita than any other country
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:37.000]  in the world we're sicker than any other any other culture has ever been but despite that i have hope
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:42.040]  in the in the human body i'm a lover of the human body i've been studying the cells and studying
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:46.680]  tissues and studying the organs of the body since 1983 when i got into pharmacy school and if
[03:18:46.680 --> 03:18:52.200]  there's one thing that i've learned it is this the human body is a healing system it's a
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:58.280]  regenerating system it is is designed divinely to heal and renew itself on a moment-to-moment
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:04.680]  basis and if we are not accessing this healing power we are doing something wrong and the fact
[03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:10.120]  of the matter is friends because of this built-in nature because of this built-in healing nature
[03:19:10.120 --> 03:19:16.920]  of the human body it is not difficult to access it it's not difficult to access what is already
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:22.520]  there we simply have to stop doing the things that cover this up most importantly we have to
[03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:30.680]  stop interacting with the corporate swill that passes for food mcdonald's taco bell processed
[03:19:30.680 --> 03:19:36.360]  food boxed foods these need to be avoided like the plague there is flat out no way we are going
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:42.360]  to be able to access our healing and health greatness as long as we are interacting with

[03:24:50.920 --> 03:24:55.240]  talking to you so please hang tight a couple things i want to say uh first of all i've been
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:25:01.000]  in the skincare business since 1983 i'm a skincare formulator i formulated products for many years
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:06.520]  i've helped people with their skin for many years we spend hundreds of millions of dollars in
[03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:11.160]  skincare on this country in this country and let me tell you something people there's not a topical
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:16.040]  skincare product in the world that can do for your eczema they can do for your rosacea they can
[03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:20.520]  do for your psoriasis they can do for your skin what a good nutritional supplement program can
[03:25:20.520 --> 03:25:25.080]  do because the fact of the matter is if you are dealing with some kind of skin health issue that
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:30.040]  is compromising the way you look and the way you appear you are flat out dealing with some kind of
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:35.720]  nutritional deficiency and or digestive health issue in fact this relationship between the
[03:25:35.720 --> 03:25:41.880]  digestive system and the skin is extremely intimate when we're a fetus in the womb a
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:48.680]  tube is formed that becomes our digestive system over time and within days to weeks the cells of
[03:25:48.680 --> 03:25:54.600]  that tube flip over and become our skin and from that point forward the skin and the digestive
[03:25:54.600 --> 03:26:00.440]  system are are like two peas in a pod they're best friends and anything that shows up on anything
[03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:04.440]  that uh any kind of breakdown in the digestive system is going to show up on the skin and
[03:26:04.440 --> 03:26:09.880]  anything that is showing up on the skin rest assured has some kind of root cause in the
[03:26:09.880 --> 03:26:14.760]  digestive system so if you guys are dealing with eczema acne psoriasis any kind of skincare health
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:18.680]  issue i want to hear from you and we can help guide you through the process of using the beyond
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:22.440]  tangy tangerine nutritional supplementation in general to take care of that by the way if you're
[03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:27.320]  interested in purchasing any of the products that you hear us talk about infowars.health
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:35.560]  for products or you can also call 1-888-789-9277 all right so if you're dealing with a skincare
[03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:42.520]  skin health issue if you've got rosacea vitiligo acne whatever it is you are dealing with the
[03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:48.440]  manifestation of a stress response that's secondary to a digestive system breakdown
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:52.760]  period end of story and if you go to a dermatologist and you go to a doctor and he gives
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:56.600]  you some kind of medicine guess what he's probably going to give you you're probably going to get
[03:26:56.600 --> 03:27:02.120]  a steroid cream why are you going to get a steroid cream what is a steroid cream a steroid cream is
[03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:07.400]  a cream that suppresses your immune system the immune system is your defense system the immune
[03:27:07.400 --> 03:27:14.440]  system is your stress management system the way dermatological treatments work the way skincare
[03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:19.720]  remedies work is they shut down the body's stress response system and this is so important to
[03:27:19.720 --> 03:27:24.840]  understand because and i've said this before about the rest of the body but it's true about the skin
[03:27:24.840 --> 03:27:31.160]  it's true about the skin as well our diseases are the manifestation of long-term activation of the
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:37.000]  stress response system secondary to breakdown in the digestive system reading from one of my
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:42.600]  favorite magazines science news this came out i just got this i just got this yesterday i'm always
[03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:47.960]  looking for articles that verify some of these ideas about health and it's our lack of health
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:54.920]  and its relationship to uh the digestive system page 10 in science news digestive juices blamed
[03:27:54.920 --> 03:28:00.120]  in shock the nutrient absorbing structures i'm reading here quote the nutrient absorbing
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:08.360]  structures in intestines break down when an animal is in shock unquote period that is all you need
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:15.720]  to know about health and wellness we go into shock mode we go into safe mode we go into stress
[03:28:15.720 --> 03:28:20.600]  management mode when our digestive system breaks down and our digestive system breaks down my
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:27.160]  friends very early in life sometimes prenatally for most of us at least it begins to break down
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:33.480]  when we leave the womb this is because when we leave the womb the human species the human being
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:39.800]  is born with a premature digestive tract we got big heads so we got to come out of the womb early
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:44.520]  we come out of the womb immature and especially at the digestive tract level but no problem
[03:28:44.520 --> 03:28:49.240]  nature takes care of everything this is where breast milk comes in breast milk is specifically
[03:28:49.240 --> 03:28:53.320]  designed to grow a digestive system by the way i'll tell you about here in a moment i'll tell
[03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:57.800]  you about a great nutritional supplement that you can use to help grow your digestive system and
[03:28:57.800 --> 03:29:03.560]  improve and help repair your digestive tract but for now i want to say that when we come out of the
[03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:10.600]  womb nature has designed a system where breast milk will grow our digestive tract if we are not
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:15.320]  breastfed long enough if we're not breastfed at all or if we're breastfed by moms who are
[03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:21.720]  themselves nutritionally compromised guess what we begin our life with strike one at the digestive
[03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:26.920]  tract level strike two begins when we interface when we interface with the standard american diet
[03:29:26.920 --> 03:29:32.200]  and by the time most of us are 10 or 12 years old our lymphatic system which is our poison and waste
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:37.480]  control system is so swollen we can't even breathe and we have to have a surgical procedure to have
[03:29:37.480 --> 03:29:41.240]  that lymph removed it's called a tonsillectomy we're gonna take a break be back with your phone

[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:42.760]  psoriasis acne the beautiful thing about the skin is it regenerates itself every four to eight weeks
[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:48.360]  which means that whatever your skin condition is today you can begin the healing process
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:52.440]  immediately and within four to eight weeks you don't have to have it any longer but you do have
[03:33:52.440 --> 03:33:56.760]  to make some corrections most especially around digestive health and wellness and nutritional
[03:33:56.760 --> 03:34:00.840]  supplementation if you're interested by the way in purchasing any of the longevity products that
[03:34:00.840 --> 03:34:10.120]  you've heard us talk about on this program go to infowars.health or you can call 1-888-789-9277
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:14.920]  all right so thanks when you think skin think digestive health when you think digestive health
[03:34:14.920 --> 03:34:21.320]  think liquid nutrition the less work your digestive system has to do the better off
[03:34:21.320 --> 03:34:28.680]  it's going to be liquid nutrition allows you to bypass digestive juices to bypass the chewing up
[03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:33.720]  process the grinding process that occurs in the stomach and it allows your nutrients to go right
[03:34:33.720 --> 03:34:39.560]  to work and in fact this is why liquid nutrients like the beyond tangy tangerine works so
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:45.080]  effectively and works so fast but you don't need need just the beyond tangy tangerine you can use
[03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:49.560]  vegetable juices you can use soups in fact one of my favorite nutritional supplements
[03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:55.880]  for the skin is bone soup where you take a chicken carcass or even a whole chicken
[03:34:55.880 --> 03:35:00.440]  drop it in a pot of water put a little apple cider vinegar in there throw some veggies in there
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:05.400]  and let the soups let the water simmer until it forms a soupy consistency and the meat falls off
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:11.000]  the bone it makes the most delicious soup you've ever had you've ever tasted and on top of that
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:16.200]  the cartilaginous factors the cartilage factors that come out of the bone and dissolve into the
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:21.240]  water are some of the best and most protective skin nutrients you could ever use and on top of
[03:35:21.240 --> 03:35:25.560]  all that it's great for your immune system it's great for your digestive system and it's great
[03:35:25.560 --> 03:35:31.080]  for your joints and it's called bone soup you can make it yourself it's cheap and tasty you
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:35.800]  can take the extra the stuff you don't use you can freeze it put it in a uh ice cube tray and
[03:35:35.800 --> 03:35:41.640]  make little ice cubes of uh bone soup ice cubes and then you can stick them in a in a uh a sauce
[03:35:41.640 --> 03:35:45.320]  pan and you can make fresh soup whatever you want or you can put in a microwave in a in a cup of
[03:35:45.320 --> 03:35:50.040]  water you can make yourself bone soup for lunch another great strategy for the digestive system
[03:35:50.040 --> 03:35:55.800]  is the longevity product called z radical z radical is made up of something called polysaccharides
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:36:01.240]  or proteoglycans which are slimy kinds of material one of the ways that we get sick and one of the
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:07.000]  ways that we get into digestive health issues digestive health issues is by attack from
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:13.000]  substances that are produced by plants and bacteria called lectins that's spelled l-e-c-t-i-n-s
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:18.120]  lectins are like sticky pods that attach themselves to our digestive tract in different
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:23.480]  parts of the body and can wreak havoc on not just digestive health but on uh urinary tract
[03:36:23.480 --> 03:36:28.600]  health on lung health on uh lectins are responsible for cancer lectins are responsible
[03:36:28.600 --> 03:36:33.720]  for gluten intolerance one of the neat things about the z radical and it's kind of slimy
[03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:39.800]  consistency is that slime coats these lectins and allows your body to excrete them and they
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:45.400]  can help improve the z radical can help improve the symptoms of h pylori infection digestive
[03:36:45.400 --> 03:36:52.520]  distress arthritis and autoimmune diseases women for uh eons have used things like cranberry juice
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:57.000]  to help dissolve and wash away the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections and what
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:02.120]  what they were doing unknowingly is using the sugars in cranberry juice to slime away the
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:07.080]  bacteria the e.coli bacteria that cause the urinary tract infection so the z radical for
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:11.400]  the digestive system the uh liquid nutrients especially the beyond tangent tangerine for
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:15.960]  the digestive system and one more really cool nutritional supplement that you can use for the
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:20.520]  digestive system and for digestive health and also for building muscle and also for brain health and
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:24.760]  also for cardiovascular cardiovascular health i'll tell you what that is here in a second but
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:30.440]  i want to get to the phones i take a couple phone calls before we do that uh dr mike i want to hear
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:37.240]  what you have to say dr mike and wyoming what's going on buddy yes hi uh dr few times i've listened
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:44.120]  to you a couple times on alex's show and uh tried to call in um i uh i graduated from ut and b in
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:51.080]  galveston and uh trained out at saint joe's in phoenix uh you you say a few things that really
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:56.200]  kind of discredit yourself uh although i i think basically you're selling a good product and uh
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:38:01.640]  i i use some of them but uh when you make statements like all diseases are nutrition based
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:06.600]  which you've made several times and uh statements to the effect that
[03:38:06.600 --> 03:38:12.120]  all physicians are just prostitutes in service to pharmaceutical uh industry well i've never
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:16.360]  i've never said that so i i mean i'm interested in what you have to say i've never said anything
[03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:19.720]  like that but but go ahead i want to hear what you have to say but don't don't be putting words
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:23.480]  in my mouth and don't be saying that uh implying that i said things that i didn't say but continue
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:27.640]  i want to hear what you have to say what's the title of your book i don't have a book i think
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:33.320]  you're mistaken me for somebody else no maybe maybe i am but i think you're mistaken oh you're
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:37.880]  talking about uh dead doctors don't lie is that what you're talking about is that your book no
[03:38:37.880 --> 03:38:42.120]  it's not my book but i i know what you're saying listen i don't want to get into a uh pissing
[03:38:42.120 --> 03:38:46.280]  contest here with you doc uh the fact of the matter is i'm not going to tell you that all
[03:38:46.280 --> 03:38:50.280]  any i don't like saying the word all i never say the word all because there's always exceptions
[03:38:50.280 --> 03:38:56.600]  however i can tell you that in my experience behind almost almost all degenerative disease
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:02.440]  crisis is a problem processing nutrients either at the digestive system level or at the intake
[03:39:02.440 --> 03:39:08.840]  level do you agree disagree with that absolutely yeah that sort of nonsense well hang on hang on
[03:39:08.840 --> 03:39:15.080]  tell me what degenerative disease does not have at its core some kind of nutrition processing
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:23.960]  a nutrition processing issue or absorption issue or a intake issue name one let me you cut me off
[03:39:23.960 --> 03:39:28.600]  let me let me finish what i had to say you you've also made a statement that uh that physicians have
[03:39:28.600 --> 03:39:32.840]  have virtually no training in in i never said that you're you're you're confusing me with somebody
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:38.680]  else i'm sorry but but you did and uh you know i i don't think you're in a position to to even
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:42.040]  make statements like that i never said those things you're confusing me with somebody else
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:45.720]  doc listen we're not going anywhere thank you so much for your call i appreciate it
[03:39:45.720 --> 03:39:54.840]  julian california what's going on hi hi hi is this uh alex jones show yes it is and i'm pharmacist
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:40:00.520]  ben fuchs sitting in for alex is alex jones in there now or no alex jones may be somewhere but
[03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:03.640]  can i help you we're talking about health and nutrition for the next 20 minutes or so
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:07.800]  okay well i was really inclined to talk to alex jones and now we're just talking about health i
[03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:13.080]  want to get your take on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications here's the deal uh
[03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:19.320]  anti-anxiety and antidepressant medication uh are number one like all pharmaceutical medication
[03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:25.480]  they're poisons number two depression and anxiety are not pharmaceutical issues they're the
[03:40:25.480 --> 03:40:31.640]  manifestation the psychological manifestation the brain manifestation of an activated stress
[03:40:31.640 --> 03:40:37.560]  response the body basically feels like it's dying now when the body feels like it's dying there's
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:42.760]  only two reasons that the body feels like it's dying number one because it thinks it's starving
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:47.720]  to death and number two it thinks it's going to be eaten by a wild animal the human body doesn't
[03:40:47.720 --> 03:40:54.200]  understand 21st century stresses because the human body is an evolutionary mechanism that has been
[03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:59.720]  around for millions of years the irs and uh our dysfunctional families and the police state and
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:05.160]  uh gluten intolerance these are all very recent phenomena to the human body so when we have a
[03:41:05.160 --> 03:41:09.960]  stress that is induced by something psychological like something that's going on in this in the
[03:41:09.960 --> 03:41:16.040]  society or a stress from prescription drugs or a stress from gluten to the body all it knows is
[03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:21.320]  that it's either about to die because it's going to be eaten by a tiger or it's about to die because
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:27.720]  it's starving to death so we call depression and we call anxiety or the psychological manifestations
[03:41:27.720 --> 03:41:32.840]  of a body in crisis a body that feels like it's about to die because it's about to be eaten
[03:41:32.840 --> 03:41:37.240]  or it's starving to death so what do you do how do you deal with these kinds of things well first
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:42.440]  of all the most important thing to deal with anxiety and depression is to somehow send the
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:48.360]  biochemistry the message that all is okay that your survival is not at stake and there's several
[03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:53.000]  ways to do that one of the simplest and one of the easiest is to practice deep breathing techniques
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:58.600]  deficiencies in oxygen will trigger this stress response that shows up as anxiety and depression
[03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:03.400]  faster than almost anything because our need for oxygen is such that three minutes without oxygen
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:09.240]  and we're dead so as soon as oxygen levels drop and carbon monoxide carbon dioxide levels go up
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:13.560]  our body will initiate the stress response which will show up physiologically as hypertension
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:19.480]  high blood pressure blood clotting a digestive distress immune suppression and will show up
[03:42:19.480 --> 03:42:26.120]  psychologically mentally as depression and anxiety anybody who gets panic attacks or anxiety attacks
[03:42:26.120 --> 03:42:34.920]  will tell you right before their anxiety attack they go into a a deep hyperventilation fast
[03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:40.680]  breathing this hyperventilation and this fast breathing initiates the anxiety and initiates
[03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:45.000]  the panic attack if you're dealing with anxiety and panic attacks don't take my word for it
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:48.840]  right before you go into a panic attack you feel like one's coming on if you're dealing with
[03:42:48.840 --> 03:42:54.680]  anxiety practice deep breathing techniques number one what you'll end up doing is you'll open up
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:59.560]  your blood vessels number two you're going to thin your blood so you'll get more oxygen to tissues
[03:42:59.560 --> 03:43:04.600]  and you'll get more nutrients to tissues and number three you'll drop your brainwave states
[03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:09.560]  from the beta wave state which is a fast-moving state that's involved in problem solving and
[03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:16.440]  distress and you'll drop it into the hypnagogic state slowly so-called alpha state this is all
[03:43:16.440 --> 03:43:21.560]  done with something as simple as deep breathing you don't need a doctor for it you don't need a
[03:43:21.560 --> 03:43:26.280]  drug for it you don't need a to interface with the medical model at all for it you don't need
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:31.560]  insurance for it and it'll cost you zero the next uh second great strategy and we've been talking
[03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:35.960]  about this on the bright side for helping with depression or helping with anxiety or helping to
[03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:43.640]  tell the body that all is right in the world is to get yourself out in the sun to lay out in the sun
[03:43:43.640 --> 03:43:49.560]  without a sunscreen without a sunblock i'm not telling you to burn burning is never a good thing
[03:43:49.560 --> 03:43:53.960]  but if you don't if you're not going to burn in five or ten minutes get yourself out in the sun
[03:43:53.960 --> 03:44:00.840]  number one the sun stimulates anabolic chemistry that is building chemistry that chemistry of
[03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:08.440]  joy and happiness is also activated by the sun and on top of all of that when the sun hits your skin
[03:44:08.440 --> 03:44:14.120]  you produce a hormone called serotonin which many many of you guys have heard of which is converted
[03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:20.600]  into melatonin melatonin is a powerful relaxing substance and it's an anti-cancer substance and
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:25.800]  it's an anti-aging substance and it's wonderful for dealing with anxiety or depression these are
[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:30.520]  two very simple strategies breathing and getting out in the sun that can allow you to access the
[03:44:30.520 --> 03:44:36.840]  body's relaxation chemistry this uh anti-anxiety chemistry for free without having to go to the
[03:44:36.840 --> 03:44:42.200]  doctor and without having to deal with an insurance program now the third very effective way to deal
[03:44:42.200 --> 03:44:47.400]  with anxiety is to make sure that you're taking care of your nutritional needs and to make sure
[03:44:47.400 --> 03:44:51.720]  you're eating less calories now these are two very important strategies that kind of
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:58.280]  go hand in hand but remember this emergency response that the body has is number one to
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:45:03.880]  prevent us from being eaten by a tiger and number two to help us deal with starvation and famine
[03:45:04.600 --> 03:45:10.520]  nutritional deficiency tells the body that a famine is approaching when we don't get vitamin c
[03:45:10.520 --> 03:45:14.920]  when we don't get vitamin e when we don't get enough essential fatty acids when we don't get
[03:45:14.920 --> 03:45:20.200]  enough protein the body thinks it's dying the body thinks it's starving the body thinks a
[03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:25.160]  famine is approaching and this too will initiate and activate the stress response which will show
[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:30.280]  up physiologically as weight gain blood clotting hypertension and will show up mentally and
[03:45:30.280 --> 03:45:36.840]  psychologically as depression and anxiety so getting yourself on a nutritional supplement
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:41.400]  program especially one that has concentrated nutrients that allow your body to access
[03:45:41.400 --> 03:45:46.520]  the nutrients without having to deal with the digestive process can be a tremendous
[03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:51.240]  help for folks dealing with anxiety so important that you'll notice results really quickly
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:56.280]  especially in terms of the water soluble vitamins especially in terms of the b complex which are
[03:45:56.280 --> 03:46:00.920]  water soluble vitamins that are processed out of most foods b complex by the way are
[03:46:00.920 --> 03:46:05.000]  intimately connected with mental health a guy named dr abram hoffa wrote a book called
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:10.920]  orthomolecular psychiatry many years ago we talked about using simple plain old niacin
[03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:17.160]  vitamin b3 to treat schizophrenia we treat it very effectively deficiencies in b vitamins are
[03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:21.880]  extremely common one of the main reasons is because we're getting so much processed food so
[03:46:21.880 --> 03:46:25.560]  your third strategy in addition to deep breathing techniques and making sure that you're getting
[03:46:25.560 --> 03:46:31.640]  a copious amounts of sunshine without a sunscreen and without burning your third strategy is to get
[03:46:31.640 --> 03:46:37.480]  yourself on a nutritional supplement program one that features the b complex and one that features
[03:46:37.480 --> 03:46:41.560]  liquid nutrition i hope i helped you there julie any other questions for you for me
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:49.960]  okay all right one uh a couple people on hold that i want to get to but before we do that i
[03:46:49.960 --> 03:46:54.200]  want to tell you about a wonderful nutritional supplement that's super for the digestive system
[03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:58.040]  and what we don't really talk about is being important for digestive health and that's whey
[03:46:58.040 --> 03:47:03.000]  protein whey protein is obviously an important building protein it's a component of milk it
[03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:11.240]  contains fractions from the milk that are designed to build the baby's digestive tract remember the
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:17.320]  baby is born human babies and mammal babies in general are born with premature digestive tract
[03:47:17.320 --> 03:47:24.280]  and nature has a system designed to build the digestive tract via breast milk well the component
[03:47:24.280 --> 03:47:29.080]  in breast milk that has the most building properties for the digestive tract is the
[03:47:29.080 --> 03:47:35.240]  whey fraction and especially the whey protein fraction so whey protein is not only a body
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:40.680]  builder's favorite food favorite supplement super source of building amino acids but it's also
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:45.800]  critical for digestive health and digestive wellness now not only is it important for
[03:47:45.800 --> 03:47:51.240]  helping build the digestive tract but there's also substances in whey protein that protect
[03:47:51.240 --> 03:47:56.520]  the digestive tract especially against those lectins that we talked about in the last
[03:47:56.520 --> 03:48:01.080]  in the last segment lectins are the sticky components on bacteria and sticky components
[03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:05.560]  that are found in vegetables that can stick or adhere themselves to the digestive tract
[03:48:05.560 --> 03:48:10.840]  whey protein has anti-lectin substances that can protect you from these uh these these lectin
[03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:15.880]  components and vegetables they can be especially whey protein can be especially effective if you're
[03:48:15.880 --> 03:48:22.200]  dealing with gluten intolerance the gluten reaction is a lectin reaction it's a sticky
[03:48:22.200 --> 03:48:26.600]  attachment to the intestine there are ingredients and whey protein that can help dissolve that
[03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:30.920]  lectin attachment not saying 100 percent of the time it's going to work but for a lot of folks
[03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:34.840]  getting on a whey protein supplement can be a wonderful way to deal with gluten intolerance
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:39.400]  issues as well as any other lectin issues and the neat thing about whey protein and one of my
[03:48:39.400 --> 03:48:44.440]  favorite things about nutritional supplementation is unlike prescription drugs that perhaps give
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:49.640]  you a little bit of purported benefit and a lot of side effects nutritional supplements give
[03:48:49.640 --> 03:48:54.360]  you benefits and instead of side effects they give you side benefits so if you take your whey
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:58.280]  protein for your digestive system you're going to find that you're building better muscle that
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:49:02.760]  you're eating less food that you got a better immune system and you're supporting circulatory
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:07.640]  system as circulatory system health as well that's one of the coolest things about getting
[03:49:07.640 --> 03:49:13.640]  yourself on a nutritional supplement program is you get multiple benefits multiple health benefits
[03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:18.440]  rather than side effects all right if you want to purchase any of the longevity products go

[03:54:06.840 --> 03:54:11.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i am pharmacist ben sitting in for the next few minutes for alex jones
[03:54:11.960 --> 03:54:17.320]  uh let's see fast food linked to asthma risk also from science news i love this magazine fast food
[03:54:17.320 --> 03:54:22.680]  linked to asthma risk surprise surprise a diet high in fast food seems to increase the risk of
[03:54:22.680 --> 03:54:30.200]  asthma this is the deal friends asthma is another manifestation of the stress response run amok and
[03:54:30.200 --> 03:54:36.600]  fast food tells the body an emergency has occurred inside inside an emergency is occurring inside the
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:42.200]  body and by the way when we eat any food we activate something called the postprandial
[03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:48.280]  immune system uh postprandial means post eating that means any food that means a good food if we
[03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:56.120]  just a salad we will activate our body's immune system let alone if we start to ingest fast food
[03:54:56.120 --> 03:55:02.280]  toxic food processed food food that's filled with excitotoxins and preservatives this idea
[03:55:02.280 --> 03:55:09.160]  of watching what you eat is so fundamentally important and also eating less food practicing
[03:55:09.160 --> 03:55:15.000]  something called intermittent fasting every single study that's been done on longevity
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:22.280]  has shown that reducing your calories increases your longevity caloric restriction with adequate
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:27.160]  nutrition is the most powerful longevity inducing strategy lifestyle strategy you could ever use
[03:55:27.160 --> 03:55:33.400]  all right uh real quick ryan in colorado uh your friend doesn't have a colon and you're uh i'm
[03:55:33.400 --> 03:55:37.880]  assuming large intestine and you're wondering about whey protein correct yeah well you were
[03:55:37.880 --> 03:55:41.960]  just talking about whey protein i was thinking about that that was exactly why i called in
[03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:45.800]  like if you could just touch on that real quick well you're not going to have to worry about it
[03:55:45.800 --> 03:55:49.720]  too much without a large intestine whey protein the amino acids and whey protein are absorbed
[03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:55.480]  very effectively i might add in the small intestine so she should be okay in that regard
[03:55:55.480 --> 03:56:00.360]  the most important thing to recognize about whey protein in my opinion is it is a tremendously
[03:56:00.360 --> 03:56:08.360]  usable source of protein and non-protein factors that help our immune system and help the body grow
[03:56:08.360 --> 03:56:12.760]  so that not only are you getting amino acids not only are you getting the building substances but
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:18.840]  you're also getting substances like lactoferrin and lact albumin and immune boosting factors
[03:56:18.840 --> 03:56:23.560]  that are designed to support the immune system and prevent you from getting cancer and degenerative
[03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:27.960]  disease that's one of the neatest things about whey protein and it's one of the important
[03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:32.760]  distinguishing features of whey protein that you don't get in other sources of protein as
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:37.320]  good as they may be hemp seed protein for example is a wonderful way to get your protein
[03:56:37.320 --> 03:56:41.960]  but it doesn't have these building factors like the lactoferrin and the albumins that are found
[03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:47.000]  in whey protein all right well we got a couple of a couple of minutes uh tim in georgia what's
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:59.480]  going on buddy do we have tim tim in georgia yes sir hello hey tim what's up buddy yeah i was
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:04.040]  actually calling in earlier to talk to alice about the way the veterans were being targeted
[03:57:04.040 --> 03:57:10.280]  by the ba you got about a minute let's hear what you have to say please go over to what you're
[03:57:10.280 --> 03:57:16.920]  talking about here i was uh diagnosed with chronic panic disorder from the navy and it turns out i
[03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:23.560]  was also diagnosed at the same time with emphysema and uh like it's kind of like a breathing deal
[03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:29.320]  over it feeds off one another and uh what was the first thing you said tim tim i didn't hear
[03:57:29.320 --> 03:57:34.280]  tim tim i didn't hear what the first thing you said chronic pain disorder chronic panic disorder
[03:57:34.280 --> 03:57:38.840]  oh chronic pat yes they do they go together this is exactly what i'm telling you when the body is
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:45.720]  deprived of oxygen it thinks it's about to die so copd and emphysema and breathing problems will
[03:57:45.720 --> 03:57:52.360]  initiate panic attacks and anxiety attacks faster than almost anything else so the two go together
[03:57:52.360 --> 03:57:56.440]  number one force yourself if you have a uh do you have a muscle injury of some kind
[03:57:56.440 --> 03:58:03.000]  you know that's the music my friend tim that's the music uh shoot me an email ben at ksco.com
