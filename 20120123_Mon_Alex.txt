[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.000]  Wow, we have got a jam-packed and extremely important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  It is Monday, the 23rd day of January 2012, and we're gonna be here, Lord willing, for
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  the next three hours. And wow, Iran has now vowed to shut down the Strait of Hormuz as
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  EU prepares oil embargo and the EU banker dictatorship.
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.000]  That's what it is. Not really the countries of Europe, they all hate their bureaucratic
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.440]  dictators and can't get out of it. And we have a member of the EU Parliament from England
[01:13.440 --> 01:20.680]  joining us today to break that down. The EU has agreed on Iranian oil embargo, their main
[01:20.680 --> 01:24.000]  source of money for the country, which is an act of war.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.920]  Iran says they're gonna go ahead and block the Strait of Hormuz, and that means WAR capital,
[01:31.920 --> 01:41.920]  with about ten exclamation points out behind it. WAR, war. What is it good for? Well, a
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.240]  lot for the New World Order. For the general public, absolutely nothing. But the bankers
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.040]  will just finance all sides of it like they always do and use it as an excuse to crack
[01:51.040 --> 01:53.360]  down everybody's liberty.
[01:53.360 --> 02:03.120]  Now the TSA lies even when the truth would suit them better. You remember, they said
[02:03.120 --> 02:06.640]  they weren't groping under 12-year-olds in the last three years, no matter how many videos
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.940]  come out. And they always said, well, now we're gonna stop. Or there were the old women
[02:11.940 --> 02:14.520]  that they were strip searching, and they said, we're not strip searching them.
[02:14.520 --> 02:18.840]  And then the videos were released via subpoena, and they are strip searching them. And they
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.280]  said, well, we just don't call it strip searching, but we apologize. In fact, guys, that came
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.840]  out last week. Will you print me the article during the break of TSA apologizes for strip
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.200]  searching, old lady?
[02:30.200 --> 02:36.040]  Because remember, she was a liar, they said. It's all semantical with them. Or hey, John
[02:36.040 --> 02:40.560]  Hopkins says there's no radiation from these scanners. And the head of John Hopkins' radiology
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.080]  department goes, the study actually shows massive increase in cancer. Of course, this
[02:45.080 --> 02:52.040]  is cancer causing. Our report says it causes cancer. Now, why do I mention all of that?
[02:52.040 --> 02:57.760]  Well, it's an out of control unconstitutional federal power grab now on the highways of
[02:57.760 --> 03:04.280]  America. And they like to go in the pants. They at least like to squeeze on the outside,
[03:04.280 --> 03:11.400]  your wife's breast, your genitals. Here's last year, or now over a year ago, November
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.560]  2010, it was a big story, carried by the Drudge Report.
[03:15.560 --> 03:24.480]  Ron Paul crotch groped by TSA calls for Boycott Airlines. You remember that? Well, what's
[03:24.480 --> 03:32.360]  the big news today? Breaking Rand Paul held by TSA at Nashville Airport. And that's what
[03:32.360 --> 03:39.120]  his father and also aged Rand Paul both tweeted that they talked to Rand and that he was held
[03:39.120 --> 03:41.640]  there and then thrown out of the airport.
[03:41.640 --> 03:46.160]  But now the TSA has said, well, we did throw him out, but we didn't detain him, even though
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.120]  they did hold him. Just like they didn't go in the pants of Miss USA. Just like they don't
[03:52.120 --> 03:56.800]  grow up, children are 12, even though they still do it. Just like they didn't turn the
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.040]  scanners off during that opt out day, but it turns out they did. Just like they lied
[04:01.040 --> 04:06.560]  and said radiation wasn't coming out of the machines and cited a report saying the radiation
[04:06.560 --> 04:10.920]  was causing cancer, and lied and said the report showed the opposite.
[04:10.920 --> 04:21.080]  A culture of pure deception. Of course, we're the enemy, and we are to be diseased by the
[04:21.080 --> 04:26.560]  TSA perverts with their little gloves they don't change during hundreds of searches a
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.040]  day on record. We're to take our shoes off and walk through the athlete's foot and flesh
[04:31.040 --> 04:44.400]  eating bacteria. But here it is breaking Rand Paul held by TSA at Nashville Airport, infowars.com.
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.960]  And we also have an article out via Steve Watson, Rand Paul detained by TSA over pat
[04:48.960 --> 04:55.160]  down standoff. All that at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. We'll break it all down.
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.960]  But frankly, I think the Iran news a little bit bigger than that. We'll be right back.
[05:00.960 --> 05:07.920]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[05:07.920 --> 05:13.600]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down
[05:13.600 --> 05:25.520]  in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch.
[05:25.520 --> 05:32.800]  guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you
[05:32.800 --> 05:42.160]  need it most. Blue diamond gusset's got it. Others don't. We turn jeans inside out diamond
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.280]  gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our defender motorcycle jeans combined
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.640]  gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours
[05:53.640 --> 06:01.440]  at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't. This is Alex Jones with five
[06:01.440 --> 06:06.040]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[06:06.040 --> 06:10.520]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy
[06:10.520 --> 06:15.040]  czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's
[06:15.040 --> 06:20.240]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[06:20.240 --> 06:24.840]  in. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[06:24.840 --> 06:29.860]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[06:29.860 --> 06:34.060]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[06:34.060 --> 06:38.680]  power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[06:38.680 --> 06:42.840]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.160]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information
[06:47.160 --> 06:52.880]  at www dot my solar backup.com. That's my solar backup.com. Remember, the government
[06:52.880 --> 07:01.720]  doesn't own the sun. So go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365. Hi, folks, this is
[07:01.720 --> 07:06.680]  Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.600]  recognize risk saving means to make money. The cow been pure soap company can save you
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.680]  thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[07:16.680 --> 07:21.760]  and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils

[07:27.840 --> 07:33.500]  of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing
[07:33.500 --> 07:37.680]  called lint. If you want something better. If you want something you've never had before
[07:37.680 --> 07:41.580]  you had to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog is easy by

[08:02.120 --> 08:08.680]  From his Central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.680 --> 08:16.820]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. How do you know when the unconstitutional
[08:16.820 --> 08:25.720]  out of their jurisdiction, unsworn and unbonded federal agents? How do you know when they're
[08:25.720 --> 08:43.960]  lying when their lips are moving? The TSA in Tennessee has held US Senator Rand Paul.
[08:43.960 --> 08:51.920]  And they put him through a scanner and then said they wanted to have a secondary search
[08:51.920 --> 08:54.600]  which I've been at the airport. They do it with a lot of people that go to the naked
[08:54.600 --> 09:02.000]  body scanners. And he said, no, you're not going to grope me. I just want to be wanted.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.600]  It's normal to not want to be touched. I mean, in the old days people being inducted into
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.320]  prison if that was the upsetting thing was being groped. Having someone touch your genitals
[09:12.320 --> 09:18.280]  but now it's a sacrament of land of the coward, home of the slave.
[09:18.280 --> 09:25.480]  And now in the same state is funny epicenters, Tennessee, but also in Illinois and Texas
[09:25.480 --> 09:32.200]  is going on in Dallas and also all over Florida. You pull up to a checkpoint and their state
[09:32.200 --> 09:40.840]  police US Army sometimes more than 15 agencies run by TSA. They're the little bosses and
[09:40.840 --> 09:46.620]  the families are jerked out of the cars and the groping begins.
[09:46.620 --> 09:51.480]  It's on the news, you can pull up just TSA checkpoint Florida and you'll actually see
[09:51.480 --> 09:57.840]  small children with pot-bellied men rubbing all over their bodies. I mean, imagine you
[09:57.840 --> 10:03.560]  pull up to a hardcore Nazi criminal checkpoint that has nothing to do with keeping you safe.
[10:03.560 --> 10:06.920]  It's all about breaking your will and they're gonna touch your wife, they're gonna touch
[10:06.920 --> 10:07.920]  your children.
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.880]  And you know what, people are just gonna start standing up to it. And that's what they want.
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.760]  They wanna get a fight going with the American people. So that all the criminals and scum
[10:18.760 --> 10:23.680]  that run the federal government can get a real war going and have the local cops march
[10:23.680 --> 10:28.600]  out to do their dirty work, equivalent of jumping in front of an 18-wheeler that's going
[10:28.600 --> 10:29.600]  100 miles an hour.
[10:29.600 --> 10:35.280]  I mean, I saw the Associated Press, Reuters, all of it Friday. I covered it yesterday on
[10:35.280 --> 10:43.560]  the Nightly News on the Sunday radio show. The top federal prosecutors that plead the
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.160]  fifth on Fast and Furious, they're all caught lying, shipping the guns in New Mexico, shipping
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.600]  the drugs back in, in all the federal documents, they've declared national security.
[10:53.600 --> 11:03.560]  It's a drug dealing group of criminals, criminals, ruthless tyrants. And they're staging the
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.760]  terror attacks, and they're listing the American people as the terrorists. And they're saying
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.960]  they'll secretly arrest us and have us disappear into black holes, and it's totally illegitimate
[11:11.960 --> 11:25.920]  and evil. And now a US senator who's all over national television and they know who he is,
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.840]  we're gonna grab your private parts, pal.
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.240]  Now the pilots, they said a year and a half ago, they said, you know what, we're just
[11:34.240 --> 11:40.120]  gonna boycott and stop flying. And again, it was in the news. A lot of these guys were
[11:40.120 --> 11:48.120]  veterans, Air Force veterans, you name it, tough guys. Some of them were Vietnam veterans.
[11:48.120 --> 11:51.720]  They would get physically ill or they would get angry or they would actually go in the
[11:51.720 --> 11:58.020]  bathroom and vomit and be so upset that they could not fly.
[11:58.020 --> 12:02.160]  And so they said, okay, we'll have a separate screening for the pilots and the people. Because
[12:02.160 --> 12:10.080]  if you're gonna be trusted to fly the plane, obviously we don't need to grab your crotch.
[12:10.080 --> 12:20.880]  Now why would full grown men vomit? Well, let me tell you something. I, flying out of
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.360]  Las Vegas last year, three or four months ago, after being out there to do interviews
[12:25.360 --> 12:31.880]  with Jesse Ventura, because we were inspecting a private rocket base and some other stuff
[12:31.880 --> 12:35.120]  that's out there, a private space program, that's why we're in Vegas.
[12:35.120 --> 12:42.080]  That's one of the reasons we were out there. And flying back out, I refused the body scanner,
[12:42.080 --> 12:45.680]  but it was about 9 AM, I was really tired, I hadn't had any sleep. And I said, I'll just
[12:45.680 --> 12:49.060]  see what this is like. But I told the guy, I said, don't touch my genitals or I will
[12:49.060 --> 12:53.760]  sue you. He goes, I know who you are, Alex Jones, I listen to your show.
[12:53.760 --> 13:02.360]  And while the guy was doing it, he was enjoying the domination. It was ridiculous, I was wearing
[13:02.360 --> 13:12.480]  a tight t-shirt and tight jeans. And you could see every part of my body and he was rubbing
[13:12.480 --> 13:18.440]  on my chest and going, just gonna check here. I'm gonna check down here, I'm gonna go right
[13:18.440 --> 13:28.140]  into your waistband. And if I hadn't been out till 3 AM with Sean Stone, Oliver Stone's
[13:28.140 --> 13:35.680]  son and Ventura's son Tyrell, and didn't have one hell of a headache, I rationalized it
[13:35.680 --> 13:36.680]  as well.
[13:36.680 --> 13:40.400]  I'll just kind of go through this prisoner of war, prisoner induction thing. And I'll
[13:40.400 --> 13:54.640]  just sue him if he goes down there to the family jewels. But the point is, this is all
[13:54.640 --> 14:02.520]  about total domination. Okay, yeah, we're in touch. We just, yeah, obviously, okay,
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.640]  well, we've just gotten information from Rand Paul's office.
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.960]  This is breaking. I know Kurt's been working from home lately until about noon. We get
[14:10.960 --> 14:17.240]  Kurt in here right now. Obviously, won't give the source in Paul's office, but this is breaking
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.480]  and the drugs report's obviously gonna want this. So yeah, I just got it right as you
[14:21.480 --> 14:22.480]  told me in my ear.
[14:22.480 --> 14:30.600]  I got it right here. No, I got it, just give this to Kurt with an update, that this is
[14:30.600 --> 14:36.980]  from a Rand Paul office source. We'll just leave it at that. Rand Paul's sources tell
[14:36.980 --> 14:43.640]  us there was an anomaly or a blip in the scanner reading, which I see with most people. Again,
[14:43.640 --> 14:45.360]  it's all about more and more groping.
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.680]  And Rand was called aside for a second screening. He offered to rescan but was only given the
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.640]  option of a pat down. He refused the pat down and was taken aside and detained. This is
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.280]  directly from somebody in his office. I'm not gonna give the source. He has recently
[14:58.280 --> 15:02.760]  been released and is currently on a plane to DC.
[15:02.760 --> 15:08.320]  We are in contact with his staff and should be speaking to him soon. I don't know if that's
[15:08.320 --> 15:13.840]  gonna be on air, but this is just what we wrote from a senior staffer, what was written
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.920]  on the phone conversation. And I will talk to that staffer during the break here when
[15:17.920 --> 15:19.880]  we go to the break in a moment.
[15:19.880 --> 15:27.160]  The point is this is all about completely breaking your will. And it's about the two
[15:27.160 --> 15:32.720]  plus million people on a no fly list. No criminal record, no judge, no jury. You can't find
[15:32.720 --> 15:40.040]  out why you're on a list. It's just you don't fly, now you don't drive. The TSA has said
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.440]  on C-SPAN, going back almost ten years ago, that they would have highway checkpoints.
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.360]  That you'd have to get their approval to have a job. You'll have a federal card. Now they've
[15:48.360 --> 15:54.760]  had the unions opt into that and make union members do it. All over the US, major unions,
[15:54.760 --> 16:02.000]  you have to get TSA approval for a job. The TSA is going to be the new total federal bureaucrat
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.960]  class that commands your local police against you.
[16:05.960 --> 16:10.400]  And who will do anything they're told and see you as an absolute enemy. And they're
[16:10.400 --> 16:15.480]  going to stick their hands down your five-year-old's pants in front of you and smile. They're going
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.960]  to grab your wife's breast and smile. They're going to take your baby's diaper off. They're
[16:20.960 --> 16:25.520]  going to let you know you're absolute scum. It's not enough to have property taxes and
[16:25.520 --> 16:30.480]  income taxes and the IRS with its own fake court stealing people's property and the rich
[16:30.480 --> 16:35.160]  are exempt and are offshore, but only the elite are allowed to be offshore and pay almost
[16:35.160 --> 16:36.720]  zero tax.
[16:36.720 --> 16:42.440]  You are gonna be absolutely dominated with forced inoculations. Government, American
[16:42.440 --> 16:46.720]  Medical Association called for it last week. California's shooting kids up without parental
[16:46.720 --> 16:52.760]  consent. It's happening. And they will start arresting people and saying, well, nobody
[16:52.760 --> 16:57.140]  really knows where Bill went. He was permanently detained, but we're sure he deserved it.
[16:57.140 --> 17:03.680]  And that's meant to be a big chilling effect with just rabid, just crazy-eyed goons running
[17:03.680 --> 17:09.040]  around everywhere on power trips. Hell is gonna be released on this nation as we go
[17:09.040 --> 17:14.520]  into total depression and just every form of depravity you can imagine. And body scanners,
[17:14.520 --> 17:21.520]  face scanners everywhere, mobile trucks, total control, cancer rates, diabetes exploding,
[17:21.520 --> 17:22.800]  neurological disorders.
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.120]  People are gonna be dying all around you. And the government's just gonna act like everything's
[17:26.120 --> 17:35.680]  fine as they soft kill the population. It's totally sick. This is the new world order.
[17:35.680 --> 17:43.280]  Ron Paul crotch growth by TSA calls for boycott of airlines. Remember that happened a few
[17:43.280 --> 17:46.840]  years ago? That's a flashback. Here's the Daily Mail. It was also in the New York Daily
[17:46.840 --> 17:54.480]  News. In fact, we'll put that one on screen. TSA apologizes to grandmothers, New York Daily
[17:54.480 --> 17:56.480]  News, cuz that's even in New York.
[17:56.480 --> 18:02.000]  But here it is, Daily Mail. TSA apologizes for strip searching two grandmothers at JFK.
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.640]  They went ahead and started lawsuits and FOIA requests and were subpoenaing stuff. So they
[18:08.640 --> 18:15.720]  said, you know what? We did take 85 and 89-year-old women, Ruth Sherman and Lenora Zimmerman,
[18:15.720 --> 18:16.720]  in the back rooms.
[18:16.720 --> 18:21.840]  We did take your clothes off, but we don't call it a strip search. Remember, they said
[18:21.840 --> 18:26.680]  John Hopkins says there's no radiation from these. The actual John Hopkins report said
[18:26.680 --> 18:33.960]  it is radiation and does cause cancer. This is how they operate. This is what they do.
[18:33.960 --> 18:43.560]  This is how they deceive. Remember three years ago, two years ago, a year ago? Remember,
[18:43.560 --> 18:47.960]  every time they get caught and there's video of them groping a two-year-old kid or whatever,
[18:47.960 --> 18:52.420]  or taking their pants off, or taking a three-year-old shirt off, and everybody's like, why, why?
[18:52.420 --> 18:56.760]  And there's some weird perv rubbing all over their skin. They take a little kid's shirt
[18:56.760 --> 18:59.600]  and pants off in front of everybody and are rubbing all over them.
[18:59.600 --> 19:04.880]  People are like, why? It's so obviously ridiculous. It's so obviously perverted. It's so obviously
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.240]  pedophile training. It's so obviously training kids that perverts can do this to them. The
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.960]  TSA comes out and says, we don't strip search people under 12. We've never have. And then
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.020]  later they go, you're right, we are. We're gonna stop now. You're right, we're gonna
[19:18.020 --> 19:19.020]  stop now.
[19:19.020 --> 19:25.480]  It's all lying to you because they see you as their enemy. It's an occupying force to
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.680]  drive a car, to have a job, to live your life. You'll have to have their approval. They're
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.760]  over the threat fusion centers. They're over your police. They're over everything. And
[19:34.760 --> 19:40.160]  already at a bus station, train stations, and now on the highways, you pull up or you
[19:40.160 --> 19:43.920]  walk in and here they are with their hands.
[19:43.920 --> 19:49.720]  I mean, I've got it in Florida, man, pulling people's clothes off in lines. It's like going
[19:49.720 --> 19:55.360]  into gas chamber showers or something. I mean, it's just total evil. This is what the
[19:55.360 --> 19:59.480]  terrorists have done to us, the people that staged 9-11, so they could turn you into a
[19:59.480 --> 20:00.800]  prisoner.

[21:34.160 --> 21:39.280]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[21:39.280 --> 21:43.920]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet

[23:56.600 --> 24:26.280]  outdoor fire.
[24:26.280 --> 24:33.840]  And it's not like any of this is my opinion. There are federal forces publicly, illegally
[24:33.840 --> 24:40.480]  federalizing all our local police. They have got them hyped up and trained that we are
[24:40.480 --> 24:46.840]  the enemy. And all over the nation, starting with the airports and fanning out, they are
[24:46.840 --> 24:50.800]  out there basically sexually assaulting the American people.
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.360]  It doesn't matter how many state reps get groped with their children and introduce legislation
[24:55.360 --> 25:01.480]  in Texas. It doesn't matter how many Congresspeople get groped and harassed. It doesn't matter.
[25:01.480 --> 25:08.400]  It's about the banking class that has hijacked this nation and controls the security forces
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.840]  having total control over society. Remember a couple of years ago there was a backfire
[25:13.840 --> 25:20.760]  in the parking garage of the Capitol building in DC.
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.460]  And they ordered all the House and Senate members to leave. And some of the senators
[25:25.460 --> 25:31.480]  weren't walking fast enough and were actually thrown down on the ground and grabbed on by
[25:31.480 --> 25:37.160]  the security forces in their black uniforms with MP5 submachine guns. Always that's the
[25:37.160 --> 25:47.960]  threat in society. In Rome 2,000 years ago, in Venezuela today, in Nigeria, Africa, in
[25:47.960 --> 25:51.720]  the United States, there it is right there.
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.720]  And the type of people they're hiring for those positions now. Just a bunch of wanting
[25:56.720 --> 26:01.680]  thugs who sit around fantasizing watching all these cop shows where they torture and
[26:01.680 --> 26:12.720]  kill people and are always right. The government is paid off with $500 billion of drug money.
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.760]  A tiny amount of that is used to buy them. The majority's laundered through large globalist
[26:18.760 --> 26:24.240]  banks. And it's all public and no one gets in trouble. And you tell cops that the government
[26:24.240 --> 26:25.240]  deals the drugs.
[26:25.240 --> 26:28.240]  They go, well, everybody knows that, but still I'm just doing my job. Doing your job, keeping
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.820]  the prices up with the drugs, train everybody to be a good slave. Your phony drug war, keep
[26:32.820 --> 26:38.920]  prices up. Your phony drug war to pack the four plus million people in private prisons
[26:38.920 --> 26:42.680]  working for 25 cents an hour, driving down everybody else's wages.
[26:42.680 --> 26:50.440]  If I see one more good old boy on unemployment going, I think it's good they're putting prisoners
[26:50.440 --> 26:56.320]  in jail for nonviolent drug offenses. And they ought to make them work. They got hot
[26:56.320 --> 27:05.160]  tubs and cable TV. No, they don't. Last time I checked, prisons in Texas are phasing out
[27:05.160 --> 27:06.160]  air conditioning.
[27:06.160 --> 27:15.600]  That's a really good idea in the summer when it's 115 degrees inside without air conditioning.
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.480]  You like 4 million people in prison at any one time working to drive down your wages
[27:20.480 --> 27:32.600]  and take your job? Are you stupid? And see, my problem is I get in here and I read this
[27:32.600 --> 27:39.240]  news and I look at it and I get so angry because I know it's just gonna get worse and worse.
[27:39.240 --> 27:44.440]  You know, folks, I told you more than 13 years ago that the big mega banks, and I listed
[27:44.440 --> 27:51.980]  the six mega banks, would implode the world economy within the next 15 years through derivatives
[27:51.980 --> 27:56.300]  and would announce a bank of the world as the solution that we would pay carbon taxes
[27:56.300 --> 27:57.300]  to.
[27:57.300 --> 28:01.720]  Exactly, that's now happened. I told you they'd start making announcements about government
[28:01.720 --> 28:10.400]  developing weaponized airborne flus, mousepox, Ebola, just so they can plausibly deny involvement
[28:10.400 --> 28:14.800]  when it gets released and claim it was an accident. They're now making the announcements
[28:14.800 --> 28:18.540]  about all these airborne weapons they're so concerned about, which means they're edging
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.400]  towards using them.
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.280]  I told you they'd pass laws to secretly arrest citizens and disappearance ahead of staging
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.680]  massive domestic terror attacks. I told you 9-11 was gonna happen and they were gonna
[28:29.680 --> 28:35.280]  blow up the World Trade Center, trade centers and blame it on their asset bin Laden. And
[28:35.280 --> 28:41.360]  then on September 11th, I said that undoubtedly in the next month, you're gonna see a bio
[28:41.360 --> 28:47.400]  attack in the US, but a small one just to prep that fear for the future.
[28:47.400 --> 28:57.000]  Now how did I know that? A lot of data goes into it, I'll just leave it at that. There's
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.480]  a lot of famous criminology cases where a detective has been tracking a serial killer
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.440]  for a decade eating, sleeping, drinking it. And they end up staking out certain spots
[29:05.440 --> 29:07.400]  on maps they've created.
[29:07.400 --> 29:12.800]  And dead reckoning actually end up being there when the serial killer dumps another body.
[29:12.800 --> 29:17.260]  I don't know how to, it's all the data, it's all the research, but I know what they're
[29:17.260 --> 29:24.100]  gonna do. And I guess in a sick way, that's kind of the good part about it. Because if
[29:24.100 --> 29:28.280]  we don't turn this around, all of you that have served the system are gonna be killed
[29:28.280 --> 29:30.540]  by it.
[29:30.540 --> 29:35.160]  And no, I'm not talking about World War III that could kick off with Iran. I'll have the
[29:35.160 --> 29:40.520]  latest on that when we get back. But Rand Paul, he doesn't want somebody grabbing his
[29:40.520 --> 29:45.040]  genitals so he's evil. I mean, I guess the new American flag should be a man having his
[29:45.040 --> 29:49.960]  genitals grabbed. I'm sorry, but that's what America is now. Land of the perverts.
[29:49.960 --> 30:02.200]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.200 --> 30:06.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[30:06.760 --> 30:09.100]  chance to not relive history.
[30:09.100 --> 30:13.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[30:13.440 --> 30:14.440]  at home.
[30:14.440 --> 30:19.480]  They have tremendous influence on our president and Congress. And they really are calling
[30:19.480 --> 30:20.480]  the shots.
[30:20.480 --> 30:25.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:25.400 --> 30:30.920]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.920 --> 30:35.480]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[30:35.480 --> 30:39.960]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[30:39.960 --> 30:42.120]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[30:42.120 --> 30:47.960]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall
[30:47.960 --> 30:48.960]  of the republic.

[31:59.840 --> 32:05.960]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[32:05.960 --> 32:11.300]  opportunity, and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Cowbend Pure Soap Company
[32:11.300 --> 32:15.640]  can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are

[32:27.000 --> 32:33.240]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating
[32:33.240 --> 32:37.120]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never
[32:37.120 --> 32:41.080]  had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[33:18.960 --> 33:34.840]  Yesterday, I talked about a little Google search I did. And that concerned Defense Department,
[33:34.840 --> 33:47.480]  Live Experiment, Disney. And if you search those terms, you will find that Disney World
[33:47.480 --> 33:53.120]  with the Department of Defense since 1996, and they're proud of this, that press releases
[33:53.120 --> 33:55.360]  on it.
[33:55.360 --> 34:04.120]  Their parks and facilities in Disney USA are live time laboratories tracking human behavior
[34:04.120 --> 34:09.800]  and are the model of the future smart cities where everywhere you go, you'll be face scanned
[34:09.800 --> 34:18.240]  and thumb printed to buy and sell. That model of having a park that's like a prison, you
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.920]  go through security to get in, you go through security to get out, is the model in Fallujah
[34:22.920 --> 34:27.960]  and Iraq and Afghanistan and is now the model in the United States.
[34:27.960 --> 34:34.360]  But see, you have paid to get in, it's so special to get queued up in the big herd lines.
[34:34.360 --> 34:39.880]  And so that's why Disney World is the beta testing ground for the latest on FEMA camp
[34:39.880 --> 34:46.920]  behavioral psychology and mass controlling of populations and people pay to go be part
[34:46.920 --> 34:53.480]  of it. I told the story on the radio last night, I was over at my parents yesterday
[34:53.480 --> 34:56.000]  afternoon and I was talking about Disney World.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.600]  And I said, well, you know the whole thing's a laboratory. I said, the shopping malls are
[35:00.600 --> 35:05.800]  now, Mall of America's hooked in with Department of Defense. That's now been confirmed. We
[35:05.800 --> 35:10.160]  had sources months ago telling us about it. And I said all of these wars, everything is
[35:10.160 --> 35:11.160]  a laboratory.
[35:11.160 --> 35:15.720]  They call it a laboratory. They call Iraq and Afghanistan laboratories. They call the
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.440]  United States a laboratory. Everything is a laboratory by the scientific technocratic
[35:20.440 --> 35:29.320]  elite to slowly test, engage and develop systems. That's why they call it the scientific dictatorship.
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.760]  And I just said, watch this. I said, I'm gonna use my little new world order data tracker
[35:34.760 --> 35:43.440]  phone. And I'm going to type into the NSA search engine that's actually there to track
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.320]  what I'm thinking about what I'm looking into.
[35:46.320 --> 35:50.760]  So you think it's just one way you're just getting info from Google and it's showing
[35:50.760 --> 35:54.280]  you some advertising. No, that's only one small part of it. But I said, watch this.
[35:54.280 --> 36:00.040]  I'm gonna type in Disney World Department of Defense, Disney World Laboratory. And it
[36:00.040 --> 36:05.320]  was just white papers, documents, press releases, hundreds of them. And I'd never even seen
[36:05.320 --> 36:06.320]  that information.
[36:06.320 --> 36:12.400]  I just knew it would be cuz it's all Department of Defense. Eisenhower said we have a technological
[36:12.400 --> 36:17.840]  ruling elite that's taken over and they control the military industrial complex. Now the media
[36:17.840 --> 36:23.160]  will never play, I played it, the full speech where he says a technocratic elite is now
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.880]  in control of 90% of all research at universities.
[36:26.880 --> 36:34.360]  We are in a scientific dictatorship. He basically goes on to warn everybody. And somebody drops
[36:34.360 --> 36:38.160]  a book or something, you hear a slam in the background. He acts totally scared like you
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.480]  think somebody's about to kill him. And he definitely went off script for that. That
[36:42.480 --> 36:44.120]  was admitted.
[36:44.120 --> 36:48.020]  They had cue cards for him and he went off script in his farewell address because he
[36:48.020 --> 36:53.560]  had somewhat of a conscience. We now know the Joint Chiefs of Staff had just approached
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.520]  him to stage terror attacks in the US, start war with the Soviets, he said no. That they'd
[36:58.520 --> 37:04.920]  recently come to him with a eugenics plan about the sodium fluoride in the water to
[37:04.920 --> 37:06.360]  reduce population.
[37:06.360 --> 37:11.920]  He discovered the cancer viruses and the vaccines. Kennedy, of course, was later briefed on all
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.480]  this and kind of flipped out. Because back then, they were from an older world. They'd
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.880]  actually been in combat in World War I and World War II. Kennedy World War II, Eisenhower
[37:21.880 --> 37:26.840]  tank commander, highly decorated World War I, I guess in the same unit as MacArthur,
[37:26.840 --> 37:29.600]  but side issue.
[37:29.600 --> 37:34.040]  All of that happening and they're going, it's a scientific dictatorship. We're gonna jack
[37:34.040 --> 37:41.200]  the food in the water and dumb them down and this is horrible. But see, that's what runs
[37:41.200 --> 37:47.080]  America now. And it's like walking around with people in a trance, and they physically
[37:47.080 --> 37:49.600]  are close to being in a trance.
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.800]  And to see people going about their business like everything's normal, they have no idea
[37:53.800 --> 38:05.920]  that an artificial environment is being constructed and is being set up in our society. Now let
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.160]  me get into the news since we have started with the whole TSA thing, let me finish up
[38:10.160 --> 38:15.240]  with it. Here's New York Daily News, Daily Mail, you name it, sorry about that.
[38:15.240 --> 38:20.080]  TSA apologizes for strip searching two grandmothers at JFK. Guys, type in for everybody watching
[38:20.080 --> 38:27.480]  or listening, TSA denies strip search of grandma. TSA denies strip search of grandma, and then
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.000]  we'll show them the next article months later. Actually, we do strip search you routinely.
[38:33.000 --> 38:42.280]  I mean, they take your clothes off. See, it all starts with answer some questions, take
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.240]  your jacket off, then your shoes, then your belt. Now I'm gonna touch the outside, now
[38:47.240 --> 38:50.680]  I'm gonna go in your pants, now I'm gonna take you behind closed doors.
[38:50.680 --> 39:03.560]  And I told you years ago, now there's the headline, New York Daily News, TSA strip deny
[39:03.560 --> 39:09.140]  Riles Granny. The feds on Saturday flatly denied that an 85-year-old Long Island woman
[39:09.140 --> 39:16.560]  was strip searched at Kennedy Airport, sparking a fresh round of outrage from the already
[39:16.560 --> 39:22.240]  steaming, mad granny, Lenore Zimmerman. But then a whole bunch of other women came out,
[39:22.240 --> 39:28.760]  hundreds of them, dozens and dozens in the news, but hundreds total complained to Congress.
[39:28.760 --> 39:34.160]  And they went, you know what, we are actually strip searching you, but it's for your safety.
[39:34.160 --> 39:39.920]  Again, here they are denying it last week. They were denying it a month before that.
[39:39.920 --> 39:46.000]  But now this week, TSA apologizes for strip searching two grandmothers at JFK. Wheelchair-bound
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.480]  Ruth Sherman, 89, was forced to show colostomy bag. And they actually ask you what they are,
[39:51.480 --> 39:53.040]  and a lot of times just pull them out of you.
[39:53.040 --> 39:56.960]  It's like, what is that? That's a colostomy bag. Well, what's a colostomy bag? Well, my
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.000]  intestines are diverted into that, and so that's where I defecate. What's defecation?
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.840]  Literally, that came out in the news. And of course, urology bags, colostomy bags, they
[40:08.840 --> 40:11.720]  just rip them off, and then reportedly laugh at you.
[40:11.720 --> 40:16.880]  And of course, they had to settle a lawsuit in Texas. Was it Midland where the woman was
[40:16.880 --> 40:21.720]  reportedly very attractive? And they made her pull her shirt off, and then three men
[40:21.720 --> 40:27.840]  got around her and asked her for dates while giggling profusely. And of course, this is
[40:27.840 --> 40:29.360]  what America is.
[40:29.360 --> 40:33.200]  And Americans will turn their daughters, their sons, their wives over to this because the
[40:33.200 --> 40:40.400]  average American likes it. They like it, and don't worry, you're gonna get a lot more.
[40:40.400 --> 40:44.360]  Can you imagine once they fully bring this in and your son comes home as a member of
[40:44.360 --> 40:50.680]  Homeland Security in his black uniform, he's 25, and starts interrogating his parents?
[40:50.680 --> 40:56.920]  This happens in every authoritarian country, and making sure that they're loyal. And then
[40:56.920 --> 41:05.040]  if the parents argue with them about any issue, politics, life, the 25-year-old son looks
[41:05.040 --> 41:12.260]  at them and says, I wonder if you're loyal, and then gets off on the fear of their parents.
[41:12.260 --> 41:21.640]  Every nobody, control freak, bully, scumbag, piece of larcenous, verminous, viperous trash
[41:21.640 --> 41:27.480]  who couldn't get a job at McDonald's will be lording over you, strutting around on power
[41:27.480 --> 41:28.480]  trips.
[41:28.480 --> 41:34.480]  They already are, bugging their eyes out at you, strutting around, just a nation of pathetic,
[41:34.480 --> 41:43.640]  disenfranchised slaves with no future. That's what this country is. And it's all because
[41:43.640 --> 41:54.040]  good people decided, America isn't about freedom. America isn't about liberty. The United States
[41:54.040 --> 41:56.000]  isn't about the people being the boss.
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.920]  No, it's about the government being the boss and tipping your hat, saluting anybody in
[42:01.920 --> 42:10.560]  a black uniform, and all of the curses that comes with it. And you see when you live in
[42:10.560 --> 42:18.600]  so much denial that you think 51 million or more dead babies since Roe v Wade, all those
[42:18.600 --> 42:19.600]  aren't humans.
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.640]  Shut up, Alex, grow a womb before you even have a comment on that. You know what? See,
[42:24.640 --> 42:29.200]  in a society where people can make excuses for something like that, well, there's gonna
[42:29.200 --> 42:35.000]  be excuses for radiation. They're saying DU is good for the troops. They didn't previously,
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.800]  but why not say it's good now?
[42:38.800 --> 42:45.360]  Radiation level goes up from that giant Chernobyl event in Fukushima, Japan. Just raise the
[42:45.360 --> 42:51.760]  level of radiation, say it's safe. Cancer rates are between 2,000, 3,000 percentage
[42:51.760 --> 42:55.440]  points higher than 50 years ago in the United States, depending on type of cancer.
[42:55.440 --> 43:01.080]  We lead the world in cancer, obesity, diabetes, neurological disorders. The wages of the New
[43:01.080 --> 43:08.840]  World Order and NAFTA and GATT and all of it is death. And see, we haven't even begun
[43:08.840 --> 43:18.200]  the dissent. You ever seen a theme park or a science lab version of a black hole? It's
[43:18.200 --> 43:24.040]  that big plastic black funnel or white funnel, and you put a quarter or a penny in it, and
[43:24.040 --> 43:28.520]  it starts rolling slowly around the outside, and then starts going towards the drain, and
[43:28.520 --> 43:30.920]  then goes super fast as it's going down the middle.
[43:30.920 --> 43:34.960]  We've only gone about an inch from the rim. We're not even that far down yet. But as we
[43:34.960 --> 43:43.840]  go around, it goes faster and faster and faster and faster. 20, 30, 40, 50 million dead, black
[43:43.840 --> 43:48.880]  uniforms, war, buildings, whole cities on fire, mass death, bioweapons. Because that's
[43:48.880 --> 43:50.920]  what psycho demons release.
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.760]  That's what they create. That's their environment. That's what they like. That's what they've
[43:54.760 --> 43:58.600]  done. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people murdered by
[43:58.600 --> 44:04.700]  government in the last century alone. Giant bioweapon labs all across the world publicly
[44:04.700 --> 44:09.620]  producing airborne weaponized garbage that kills 90 plus percent of those that come in
[44:09.620 --> 44:15.280]  contact with it, stored in level two facilities everywhere, just waiting for it to be released.
[44:15.280 --> 44:21.440]  Zoological weapons, GMO, hundreds of species spliced together, injected into human embryos,
[44:21.440 --> 44:28.080]  monkey embryos, GMO dolphins released, every form of hellish bondage you can imagine, just
[44:28.080 --> 44:37.720]  systematic preparing to be released. All of this is just getting in in line. They're trying
[44:37.720 --> 44:40.880]  to train the military and police to kill US citizens and arrest us.
[44:40.880 --> 44:44.560]  And they always say, that's treasonous. I wanna see the law. I've talked to the troops
[44:44.560 --> 44:50.160]  on air. I've been to the urban drills. I videotaped them training for this. And most of them,
[44:50.160 --> 44:55.140]  on average about 80%, it's right about 79%, technically, say they won't do it. So now
[44:55.140 --> 45:00.220]  they're coming to them and going, here's NDAA, here's the law, train for it.
[45:00.220 --> 45:06.720]  Every ROTC in the last 20 years I've studied, trying to kill US gun owners, they call them
[45:06.720 --> 45:13.600]  malicious. Every urban warfare drill in major cities with the Boy Scouts training to rat
[45:13.600 --> 45:19.760]  out their mommy and daddy, and now it's in the New York Times. Every drill training to
[45:19.760 --> 45:25.880]  execute US citizens, every drill preparing for treason and corruption and out of control
[45:25.880 --> 45:29.760]  total evil, 100%.
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.960]  And now Jack Bauer torturing people's kids simulated on TV to get the answers on the
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.480]  terrorist. By the way, in that Ron Paul article, do we have the video posted in that? Cuz it's
[45:39.480 --> 45:43.240]  just a dead screen in here. That's what I was asking earlier. It's his flashback Ron
[45:43.240 --> 45:49.600]  Paul grope by TSA, that video is posted in that? Okay, great. Flashback Ron Paul grope
[45:49.600 --> 45:51.860]  by TSA.
[45:51.860 --> 45:56.360]  This is about pulling up and being lined up you and your family and men putting their
[45:56.360 --> 46:01.560]  hands on your kids and your wife and you not doing anything about it. So they can forcibly
[46:01.560 --> 46:08.980]  inoculate you. How do I know that? Because it's all in the Model States Health Emergency
[46:08.980 --> 46:13.760]  Powers Act and it's in all the clergy response documents I got three years before it was
[46:13.760 --> 46:15.860]  leaked to the mainstream media.
[46:15.860 --> 46:22.720]  They've trained over 100,000 clergy last documents we got to go to FEMA camps to take injections
[46:22.720 --> 46:27.880]  and let the state take your children. Your preacher in your town in almost every case
[46:27.880 --> 46:34.280]  is a FEMA minion getting a side paycheck from Homeland Security and is a traitorous creepy
[46:34.280 --> 46:41.520]  criminal devil up there looking at you as enemies. And he gets off on going and talking
[46:41.520 --> 46:46.440]  to the military and Homeland Security and FEMA about their flock and writing reports
[46:46.440 --> 46:51.040]  on people that come to get counseling from them.
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.520]  At big churches, most of the counselors are Homeland Security spies. Everywhere just scum
[46:56.520 --> 47:04.880]  and filth and trash and traitors and infra guard. I mean, it's just unbelievable what
[47:04.880 --> 47:12.080]  we've turned into a massive army of evil with chicken neck do gooders serving them in giant
[47:12.080 --> 47:16.680]  armies of hell and devilish worship.
[47:16.680 --> 47:26.080]  Absolutely hell bent on delivering this country and the rest of the world into hell on earth.
[47:26.080 --> 47:33.360]  Then I'm angry. I told you again, you ever seen the thing where you throw the quarter
[47:33.360 --> 47:38.400]  into the black hole simulator and it starts real slow around the edge. And then as it
[47:38.400 --> 47:46.320]  goes around faster and faster and faster and we're about an inch down from the rim and
[47:46.320 --> 47:58.680]  the quarter starting to go quicker. And when it goes down, hell is released, boom, boom,
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.840]  giant black op armies just lined up on battlefield lines.
[48:02.840 --> 48:06.840]  You've been beta testing, tracking, studying humanity, shipping the drugs in, shipping
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.560]  the little kids out publicly, just setting it up, setting it up, setting it up, testing
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.220]  the military, testing the police, finding the operatives that will follow the orders,
[48:15.220 --> 48:20.880]  lining up hell's army, lining it up throngs of them, lining them up on the 50 yard line
[48:20.880 --> 48:23.000]  right against us, looking right into our eyes.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.320]  And I'm running around saying, ladies and gentlemen, red alert, get ready, get worn
[48:27.320 --> 48:32.520]  everybody you can, it's hardcore, it's life and death. And then I've got to have all these
[48:32.520 --> 48:36.640]  idiots send me emails and see news articles, not just in mainstream news, but alternative
[48:36.640 --> 48:39.160]  going, Jones goes a little too far.
[48:39.160 --> 48:45.760]  You think all these histrionics goes anywhere towards the reality that in congressional
[48:45.760 --> 48:51.040]  hearings, you can type it into YouTube, Rumsfeld grilled on child kidnapping. And they say,
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.840]  well, what about all these kids being grabbed by DynCorp and disappearing in sex slavery?
[48:55.840 --> 48:59.520]  And he says, well, Dr. Chu, what happened with that? Dr. Chu goes, well, they're allowed
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.900]  to under contract. They were put in a penalty box for one year on those contracts, but no
[49:05.900 --> 49:07.240]  one will get in trouble.
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.920]  And then the commerce people are like, so no one gets in trouble. And Rumsfeld said
[49:12.920 --> 49:20.400]  no. Just like the federal prosecutor, one of the top federal prosecutors is gonna declare
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.440]  the fifth in Fast and Furious, nothing's gonna happen to them. They're gonna ship guns into
[49:25.440 --> 49:27.920]  Mexico and ship cocaine and heroin in.
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.300]  And they're gonna have drug dealers pushing on your kids. And then your kids are gonna
[49:31.300 --> 49:36.080]  get busted by the cops and go work in a private prison. Or they're gonna be raped and contract
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.680]  hepatitis and HIV and tuberculosis. And then they're gonna go work at the restaurant where
[49:42.680 --> 49:46.880]  you eat and cough it on your food and you're gonna die from it, the tuberculosis.
[49:46.880 --> 49:54.200]  Hope you enjoy it. Just an example. Just factories of disease, factories of pain, factories of
[49:54.200 --> 50:00.400]  birth defects, factories of cancer, factories of curses and devilishness and implosion and
[50:00.400 --> 50:07.580]  obesity and demonic entities and just hell's gates open, just valleys of pus and evil pouring
[50:07.580 --> 50:12.480]  out the curses of the New World Order, the curses of abortion, the curses of serving
[50:12.480 --> 50:18.880]  evil, the curses of all the globalism, all their dark masters, all their dark generals,
[50:18.880 --> 50:28.240]  all their dark magicians bringing forth hell, bringing forth judgment, bringing forth annihilation.
[50:28.240 --> 50:34.080]  Giant robot armies, giant drone armies, tens of thousands of drones, weaponized, face scanning,
[50:34.080 --> 50:38.840]  coming into US cities, scanning you, murdering you and your family, GPS coordinates for your
[50:38.840 --> 50:44.600]  front door to fire, hellfire missiles right up your giant brainwashed troop bases with
[50:44.600 --> 50:52.360]  inoculated guinea pigs snorting depleted uranium until hell opens.
[50:52.360 --> 50:58.900]  More murder, more death, more sickness, more filth, always pressing on the filthy degenerate
[50:58.900 --> 51:04.760]  nerve of power. There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve

[54:07.160 --> 54:19.080]  You see, I can see the evil. I've studied history. And I'm doing everything I can to
[54:19.080 --> 54:25.520]  get us as society to wake up and repent. And if you're not a Christian, whatever I'm talking
[54:25.520 --> 54:31.960]  about by repenting, admitting how lazy we've all been and how we've let ourselves put up
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.400]  with corruption and put up with tyranny. And my main job here is as this tyranny comes
[54:37.400 --> 54:43.840]  in and it's coming in, that enough people have been warned about who did it, who was
[54:43.840 --> 54:46.760]  behind it, why they did it.
[54:46.760 --> 54:52.920]  That then people will finally listen, we can do something about this. And I know I get
[54:52.920 --> 55:02.540]  dark but reality's dark folks, 51 million aborted babies is big. The globalist spreading
[55:02.540 --> 55:09.480]  disease worldwide on record and the fact that it's fact and nobody gets in trouble for it.
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.840]  The fact that the ATF doesn't get in trouble for narcotics trafficking along with the FBI
[55:13.840 --> 55:19.180]  and six other federal agencies, it's all on record. We broke the stinking news. We just
[55:19.180 --> 55:26.800]  didn't call it Fast and Furious. We didn't know the name of the program six years ago.
[55:26.800 --> 55:33.100]  It makes me sick. This isn't about my big radio show and my gosh, 15 million listeners
[55:33.100 --> 55:39.360]  and all this and boy, the ego and everything. I'm somebody who is thinking about this all
[55:39.360 --> 55:44.400]  the time when I'm dreaming, when I'm jogging, when I'm eating dinner, when I'm rocking one
[55:44.400 --> 55:46.160]  of my children to sleep.
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.840]  And I just look in their eyes and their innocence and there's so much good in the world. There's
[55:50.840 --> 55:55.320]  so much innocence in the world. There's so many good things that we've got to protect
[55:55.320 --> 56:01.640]  and I'm angry. I'm angry at men out there who are too weak minded to face the facts
[56:01.640 --> 56:03.960]  cuz I know I'm right.
[56:03.960 --> 56:09.740]  How much more is gonna come true? How much further down this road do we gotta get before
[56:09.740 --> 56:19.440]  you wake up? I got the Iran news here. We got a member of the European Union Parliament
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.360]  joining us coming up. I wanna play a clip though of Rand Paul talking to Pistoli, the
[56:25.360 --> 56:28.920]  head of the TSA, about children being robbed.
[56:28.920 --> 56:32.880]  And I've seen clips from Pistoli. I haven't watched this whole clip yet. They were just
[56:32.880 --> 56:35.520]  shown to me during the break. Well, Pistoli denies they even do it even though there's
[56:35.520 --> 56:42.080]  thousands of videos of it. I mean, again, they're just scum. They're enemies. They hate
[56:42.080 --> 56:47.560]  you. They hate America. Globalists do hate America. That's why they're totally destroying
[56:47.560 --> 56:52.280]  it and turning it into a joke, a joke of absurdist police state.
[56:52.280 --> 56:53.280]  Here's Rand Paul.
[56:53.280 --> 56:57.280]  A girl from Bowling Green that was on Good Morning America that many people saw. And
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.580]  she was on there with a TSA agent doing an invasive search inside of her clothing, inside
[57:02.580 --> 57:06.760]  of her pants. We had an eight-month-old who's having their diaper inspected. Then we had
[57:06.760 --> 57:12.680]  a 95-year-old who had their diaper taken off and inspected and stayed, I presume, for hours
[57:12.680 --> 57:13.680]  waiting to get-
[57:13.680 --> 57:15.240]  It's all about humiliation.
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.400]  When the TSA head, Pistoli, was here, he said, well, we need to do these invasive searches.
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.640]  And he said, well, you may slow down or we may not do them as much. But then he sent
[57:24.640 --> 57:29.360]  me a letter and said absolutely that we have to because an eight-year-old in Kandahar exploded
[57:29.360 --> 57:35.640]  a bomb. To me, I think that shows a bit of naivete to think that somehow there's a similarity
[57:35.640 --> 57:39.400]  between an eight-year-old in Kandahar and an eight-year-old in Bowling Green, Kentucky.
[57:39.400 --> 57:44.320]  I mean, the only similarity is their age. And I wouldn't consider them to be-
[57:44.320 --> 57:50.620]  Well, that's enough. No, they're not naive. We're the terrorists. Al Qaeda, who's gotten
[57:50.620 --> 57:57.620]  on the airplanes and given control of Libya and Syria, they work for the New World Order.
[57:57.620 --> 58:05.600]  And I know Rand knows that. But this whole Homeland Security thing that good old boys
[58:05.600 --> 58:08.600]  think is for the Muslims and all the rest of it that you hate so much, no, it's for
[58:08.600 --> 58:12.800]  you. And it's always been for you.
[58:12.800 --> 58:17.300]  And you wait till they try to start this war with Iran. Iran says if they cut off their
[58:17.300 --> 58:22.380]  oil supply, their oil sales, they're gonna block the Strait of Hormuz. Well, Europe's
[58:22.380 --> 58:28.640]  voted to do it. That is the bankers that have hijacked Europe. And so the next few weeks
[58:28.640 --> 58:33.720]  are gonna be interesting. There's a very good chance a major war is gonna break out, which
[58:33.720 --> 58:37.720]  is exactly what the bankers want. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[58:37.720 --> 58:47.320]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.320 --> 58:54.800]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing nonhybrid
[58:54.800 --> 58:59.360]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[58:59.360 --> 59:03.960]  nonhybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[59:03.960 --> 59:08.160]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[59:08.160 --> 59:12.480]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of nonhybrid
[59:12.480 --> 59:18.780]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[59:18.780 --> 59:23.060]  food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[59:23.060 --> 59:28.440]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[59:28.440 --> 59:34.120]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[59:34.120 --> 59:45.800]  a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, nonhybrid seeds
[59:45.800 --> 59:49.800]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[59:49.800 --> 01:00:07.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:15.480]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:22.040]  GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:41.120]  All right, I blew a gasket in the last hour because I just think about the TSA groping
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.520]  all those children, the forced inoculation starting up around the country. I see the
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.400]  news tightening around our republic's throat. I see the global is gearing up for new giant
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.240]  wars. And then what really got me mad before I even went on air today was I kept reading
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:00.800]  all these articles where these billionaires and 100 million air people on average pay
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.500]  about 3% tax.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:13.040]  And that's if they try to bring money back in the US. Here's a London Independent article.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:19.640]  And you know about Google paying 2.4 tax, General Electric, zero. Super rich Romney
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:26.280]  admits paying only 15% in taxes. Folks, somebody making $30,000 a year pays more than that,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:33.040]  one way or the other to the feds. I mean, I pay 35%. And by the way, I pay a lot more
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.280]  than that cuz they've gotten rid of all the exemptions.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.680]  And then people say, well, stop paying them. Yeah, we didn't have the income tax till 1913.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.560]  Yeah, it wasn't adopted generally until 1951. I know all that. I know you write the checks
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.120]  to the Federal Reserve. I know it's a scam. I understand that, but I have to choose my
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.440]  battles. But the point is they've gotten rid of all the exemptions. What, five, six years
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.120]  ago, they changed the law where CPAs are basically agents of the IRS.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:09.760]  So you get audited constantly if you don't use a big establishment auditing firm, CPA
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:16.960]  firm, and then they don't give you all the exemptions. And so you pay more like 45%.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.300]  So then you simply just try to make sure you spend all your money on the operation, which
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:28.200]  is what we wanna do anyways. Then your employees just all pay it. Or you build a studio in
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.400]  your building. And the state of Texas comes along. One of the taxes Rick Perry got passed
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.640]  is he doubled the size of government.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.240]  Folks found out about that. That's why he's dropped out of the race now when he was the
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.520]  heir apparent. The globalist thought they'd have it, and then they made him the leader
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:49.880]  out of the gates, remember? But he got this tax where they tax everything in your business.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.720]  It's an income tax. And then they got this hospital district property tax thing on top
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:03.460]  of it. And everything in here, every year I get charged for, this on-air life. They're
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:07.800]  building a giant bureaucracy of a little snot-nosed inspectors that wanna force their way into
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.540]  your business with no warrant.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.840]  And when they come around, they're on real power trips all geared up and you're the enemy
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:23.440]  and you're supposed to lick their boots all day and chew the barnacles off their feet.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.560]  I mean, I'm just sick of it. Just sick of it. I hate being a slave. I hate it. I hate
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.640]  it. I hate it. And I'll tell you what I hate even more. I hate everybody licking boots
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.880]  and loving it.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.520]  So pathetic. People think they get ahead by rolling over on their back like a dog to these
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:44.640]  people. All that does is let the globalist chew your guts out. The time is coming to
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:53.560]  get more aggressive in the info war. Can you imagine if people spray painted in legal and
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:04:03.260]  lawful areas, nationwide TSA or tyrants, TSA or pedophiles, or infowars.com.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:07.800]  Imagine every city, town, and county and people on the sides of their barns, businesses, t-shirts,
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.480]  spraypainted infowars.com or stenciled it. I mean, hell, ATF shipping guns into Mexico
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.040]  and drugs back into the US publicly. I'm not saying you should ever do anything and spraypaint
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.360]  government buildings or propaganda billboards.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.600]  God forbid we do anything like that. So just do it in legal and lawful areas. But I wanna
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.780]  see aggressive banner hangs on highways. I wanna see people aggressively putting whatever
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.960]  message you want on the side of your barn. And I did see some of those when I travel
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.120]  around the country.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:45.520]  I wanna see all sorts of images and messages that we know what's going on. Like I'm getting
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.880]  a bumper sticker made that says, I can see, I'm awake. Just so people can say, what does
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.920]  that mean? You can say, you don't know? You don't know what's going on? We'll be right
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:01.760]  back. Stay with us.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.600]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.440]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.920]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver

[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.800]  Okay, for the next 30 minutes then I'll get into other news and your calls. We're joined
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:27.600]  by Paul Nuttall. He's a European Union Member of Parliament out of England and he's part
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:36.200]  of the UK Independence Party. At 32, he got elected as UKIP's youngest ever chairman.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.640]  And he is certainly doing a great job over there exposing the globalist and the socialist
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.960]  takeover through the EU dictatorship. Something that the UK Independence Party, Lord Monckton
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.320]  and others been exposing for a long time.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.720]  Now it's admitted. And the last head of the EU, Von Rupy, admitted they want a socialist
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.760]  world government. But I wanted to play a clip from three and a half years ago of the UK
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:06.000]  Independence Party member Paul Nuttall in the European Parliament exposing the carbon
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.320]  tax fraud.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.760]  And of course, years later, it all comes out that they know it's a fraud internally with
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.020]  the whole climate gate situation. But we'll also look at the EU move for sanctions on
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:21.720]  Iran with him. And we'll also look at some of the other big developments happening in
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.400]  the EU dictatorship right now.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.680]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.440]  Mr. President, I've just heard a socialist colleague over there talking about Greenland
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.880]  and the ice melting in Greenland. Well, the question I'd like to ask on this subject is,
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.920]  why is Greenland called Greenland? Is it perhaps because Greenland was once green when the
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.240]  world was hotter?
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.000]  Well, it seems that the British people are onto this because a recent opinion poll in
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.640]  the Times newspaper clearly shows that the British people no longer believe in so-called
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:10:00.480]  man-made global warming. The British people are very astute. And they're clear that politicians
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.200]  have hijacked the environmentalist agenda. It's been cynically used to raise taxes, to
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:13.060]  exert control, and now it's being used by the European Union to justify your own existence.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.120]  This week, we've also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate research centres
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:23.360]  in the UK, which advises the government being caught, altering data, and stifling debate.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.000]  It's an absolute disgrace. So I look forward to Copenhagen, when the political class is
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.720]  sitting around the table, awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room,
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.200]  which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past ten years.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.200]  Thank you.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.720]  I take it out of Paul Nuttall, so much to talk about in the 20 minutes we have or so
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.800]  with him. But for those that don't understand, you've got people that are elected to the
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.720]  Parliament, but the bureaucrats actually have all the power, and now set, what is it, 80
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.960]  plus percent of the laws in England, without England ever even really being officially
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960]  brought into the Europe.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:02.960]  Yeah, about 80, around 80% of our laws are now made, not by the Parliament, not by people
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.280]  who are elected. It's made by the European Commission. And now the European Commission
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.000]  is about a mile up the road from the European Parliament, and they sit in something called
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.800]  a bail-a-mont building. And these 27 commissioners make these laws, make these rules, make these
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.960]  directives in secret. They meet in secret, and what's worse is there's 4,000 working
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.000]  groups who sit around the Commission and advise them on these regulations. And we've asked
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  before in the past, what big business is involved here? What lobbyist groups are involved in
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.320]  these working groups? And the Commission won't even tell us. It's that secretive. It's
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.880]  that out of control.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.240]  And finally, the people of Britain seem to be waking up to this. And if you look at the
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:46.240]  opinion polls over the past couple of years, people now are consistently agreeing with
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.440]  UKIP's position, which is quite simply that Britain will be best at our 1,000 governing
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.060]  guard own affairs.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:56.400]  And even as you know, but for listeners in the US, Cameron had said, I won't let the
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.580]  people of the UK vote on getting out of the euro, even though they never voted to get
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:06.960]  into it. But now he's kind of backed off for now because of the huge awakening and said,
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.920]  yeah, no, we're not going to basically vote to expand EU power over us.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:17.320]  David Cameron's position on this has been a disgrace from day one. When he was in opposition,
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.640]  he gave us a cast-iron guarantee. He wrote in the biggest-selling newspaper in this country,
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.640]  it's called The Sun. He wrote in that newspaper that he would give us a cast-iron guarantee
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.400]  that we would be given a vote on the Lisbon Treaty. He then backtracked on that after
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.400]  the European elections, after he promised his own voters, people who went out and voted
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.120]  near Charles Conservative in 2009, on the back of that promise. He then reneged a couple
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.880]  of days later, disgraceful stuff. Now he's come into power, he sold us completely down
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880]  the river.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.440]  Four months ago, there was a petition, we have a system in this country now where if
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:57.520]  online there's 100,000 people signed a petition, we can have a debate in Parliament on an issue.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.960]  And there was a debate on whether we should have a referendum on our membership of the
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.040]  European Union. David Cameron, not only David Cameron, but Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, so
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.840]  the leaders of the three biggest parties in this country, three-line whipped their own
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.680]  members to vote against a referendum. These people are terrified of the views of the people.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.240]  And what's interesting is that the last referendum we had on the issue of Europe was
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:27.840]  back in 1975. So if you're under 54, you've never had a vote on this issue. David Cameron
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.520]  himself, Ed Miliband, and Nick Clegg are all under 54, and they've never had a vote on
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:39.840]  it. And what we voted on in 75 was trade. We voted to join the European Economic Community.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.960]  What we've got now is the embryo. I wouldn't even call it an embryo anymore. We're being
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.160]  guided towards a political superstate.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:53.040]  And when you look at Von Rumski and others, they admit it's global governance. It's unelected.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.480]  It's anti-family. In Europe, I've seen in Der Spiegel where there won't be single-parent
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.360]  homes allowed anymore. They wanna make everybody live in communes. I mean, this is a cult of
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.800]  sickos. Even the Russians call it the new Soviet.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.440]  Yeah, the Russians do. And what is interesting is that there are quite close comparisons
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.200]  between the Soviet Union and the European Union. If you look at the structure, you've
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.280]  got a commission which meets in secret, very much like a polyp euro, shall we say. And
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.640]  then you've got a European parliament, which is in effect a complete joke. I mean, the
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.360]  whole thing is smoke and mirrors. It has no power whatsoever. The real power lies with
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:40.000]  the people who meet in secret. That very much mirrors the Supreme Soviets. There is a definite
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.600]  likeness between the two. And I suppose there is no coincidence that a lot of the commissioners
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.800]  do tend to be ex-communists, including the head of the commission, the president of the
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.680]  commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, who's an ex-malice. And yes, I mean, it's all about
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:02.680]  not listening to the people. And I never forget listening to Peter Mandelson, who was a minister
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.600]  in the Blair government and then was sacked and went on to be a European commissioner.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:13.080]  I never forget him as trade commissioner talking about what we live in now is a post-democratic
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.760]  society. What does that mean? What does a post-democratic society mean? It was frightening.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.240]  And then to hear a couple of months later, Jose Manuel Barroso described referendums
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:32.200]  as inconvenient when the Dutch and when the French voted no to the European Lisbon Treaty.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.440]  To then hear him say that the referendums were inconvenient was a disgrace. And then
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.680]  he went on and described the EU as the first non-imperial empire.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:48.800]  The first non-imperial empire and expanding on that now, I mean, I read Economist magazine
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.060]  every week when it comes out. And of course, it's a big establishment rag. And almost every
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:59.000]  article is how we have technocrats now. And it's good, you can have elected people, but
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.360]  they're not gonna run anything. The central bankers that created the derivatives and we're
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.100]  gonna raise your taxes and have it paid to private groups and we're gonna run everything
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.100]  in your life.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:16.380]  And it's good to have dictatorial groups running things. They actually admit it, but then separately
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:21.600]  for lower strata, they have the mainstream media. When I talk about it or you talk about
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.320]  it or Ron Paul talks about it, they call it a conspiracy theory when it's all admitted.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.360]  Well, this sort of ties in, doesn't it, to exactly what Peter Mandelson said when he
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.120]  spoke about the post-democratic society where in effect he believes, and I'm sure others
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.880]  in the commission believe because this is the system that they're working in, are making
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.880]  a lot of money out of it. I hasten to add, the system they believe works best is the
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.520]  one where you cut out the people, where you ignore the people, where you make the people
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.920]  of Ireland vote twice on two occasions in referendums when the Irish people said no
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:59.520]  to the Nice Treaty, they were made to vote again. When the Irish people said no to the
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.680]  Lisbon Treaty, they were made to vote again. It's all about taking no notice of the people
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:11.320]  and the EU juggernauts will march on. Even to the point now where Croatia, through a
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.760]  very dodgy referendum over the weekend, I hasten to add, has now voted to join the European
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.440]  Union, it will expand further east. It will expand and it will expand and it will expand
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.480]  and I remember about ten years ago, Romaro Prozi, the former head of the commission,
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.840]  talking about one day he looks forward to countries like Tunisia and Morocco also joining
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:38.480]  the European Union, even though they're not actually in Europe. This whole thing is expansionist,
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.600]  it's imperialist, and quite frankly, the sooner we, the Brits are better off out, well, it'll
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.000]  be better for everybody.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.640]  Well, it certainly will. Let's look at this Iran situation. I mean, this is not even really
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:56.240]  big news here in the US. Iran vows to shut down Strait of Hormuz as EU passes oil embargo
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.680]  and the United States and NATO have said they're gonna attack Iran if they block the Strait
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.760]  of Hormuz.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.800]  But it is an act of war to cut off their oil sales. Again, I'm not a fan of the moolahs,
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.280]  but I mean, I don't think a lot of people realize this is a huge escalation. Why would
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.960]  the Eurocrats want to do this? Because a war is a good political distraction from their
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.960]  power grabbing?
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:22.160]  I'm not sure about that. I'm not even sure they realize the brevity of the situation
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.240]  that they've got themselves into. I mean, let me just explain. All new contracts in
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:34.120]  crude oil and petroleum will now be banned within the EU from Iran. And also, all existing
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.680]  contracts will be canceled in July. On top of that, the Iranian central bank could have
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:43.160]  its assets frozen in the European Union. And of course, we've got the problem in the
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:49.960]  Middle East and Hormuz where six battleships or six warships from America, France and Britain
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.320]  sailed through there over the weekend in a show of strength, a show of power. It was
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.640]  a warning to the moolahs that we won't stand for this. And I think we are tinkering on
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.080]  the brink of something very, very frightening indeed, because as a response, the Iranians
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.120]  could as well attempt to shut that strait and then you could see the first guns fired
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.720]  in the conflict.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.240]  Now I mean, again, if you're just joining us, you're a member of the European Union
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.920]  Parliament hailing out of the UK. Paul Nuttall is our guest, member of the UK Independence
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:31.300]  Party. And he's the youngest chairman ever of that party, which is the fastest growing
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.960]  now in the UK as folks begin to wake up there.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.880]  As they're waking up here, if you're a new listener or aren't familiar with UK politics,
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:44.320]  it's basically a Ron Paul style, national sovereignty, constitutional, libertarian,
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.880]  conservative, just common sense. They're not globalist, Marxist, Leninist, New World Order,
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:56.920]  banker minions basically. Looking at this and looking forward, when can we expect to
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.480]  see Iran respond to this?
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.640]  What's the time frame on these contracts?
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:08.600]  Well, the time frame on the contract is that it's immediate. The embargo is immediate
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:16.800]  and as I say, existing contracts will be cut off in July. And I expect to see Iran respond
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.760]  pretty quickly. And I think as I said a minute ago, I think we are thinking on the brink
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.880]  of something scary. But you know, the European Union, I mean, it was the foreign ministers
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.880]  of the nation's states who have agreed this alongside ambassadors. So taking that aside,
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.600]  the European Union is encroaching international sovereignty in the area of foreign policy
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.320]  because we now have the high representative, of course, Baroness Ashton, who's never
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.120]  been elected to anything in her life. She's a political appointee of the European Union.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:52.200]  And it's also now beginning to put in place embassies right across the globe, which in
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:57.640]  effect are going to supersede the embassies of the nation's states. It is a complete
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:07.200]  and utter affront to democracy and it's also a complete and utter affront to national sovereignty.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:12.160]  It certainly is. Now, you talk about the awakening. Give us some indicators of that that you're
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:18.080]  seeing in England, in the rest of the UK. Are you starting to see an awakening in Europe
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:25.720]  to the Euro's tyranny with the bureaucrats installing their own people over these countries
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:29.720]  that they're sucking dry right now? Well, you've seen it happen twice now over
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:36.160]  the past three months. You've seen Berlusconi removed in Italy and you've got a bureaucrat
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.800]  now who's not been elected, placed as prime minister. You've also seen the same in Greece
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.240]  where Papandreou was forced aside and now we have another bureaucrat again who hasn't
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:51.800]  been elected, who's been put in his place. So they really are showing their teeth here.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.520]  They're really showing their true selves. The awakening which is going on is happening
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:00.800]  right across the board. The people are out on streets burning EU flags in Lisbon, in
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:06.240]  Athens, in Rome. There's a real movement out there against the European Union and what
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:13.000]  you're seeing in Northern Europe is a revolution really in the polls. What you're seeing
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.080]  in Finland, for example, with the true Finns. You're seeing it in Holland with head builders.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.840]  Frighteningly enough, you're seeing it now beginning in France. If you look at the opinion
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.760]  polls in France where Front National are leaving in the polls out there and it looks like Marine
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:35.680]  Le Pen could certainly get into the second round of the French presidency elections this
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.720]  year. There is a movement, an anti-EU movement right across Northern Europe and what we're
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:46.240]  seeing here in the UK is a growth of UKIP not only in members but also in the opinion
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.640]  polls and at the moment UKIP is almost neck and neck with the Liberal Democrats who are
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:59.200]  actually in government. So UKIP seems to have grown from 2-3% to around 8-11% in the opinion
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.720]  polls and as I say what we need to do is we need to keep this momentum up and we need
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:09.720]  to ensure that the opinion poll ratings that we've got at the moment then transcend into
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:17.160]  votes at local elections and the big one for us is 2014 where we believe, we genuinely
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.400]  think we can go on and cause a political earthquake in this country and win those European elections.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:28.040]  Now expanding on this and if you just join us we have a European Union member of parliament
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.840]  Paul Nuttall on with us from the UK Independence Party. I know in Europe they're starting TSA
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:39.520]  style naked body scanners, doing some groping. I know that there's more and more checkpoints
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:44.720]  on the highways, more and more internal policing while the borders themselves in many areas
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.880]  are wide open. What other types of police state stuff are you seeing? I know that they've
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:55.080]  got politically correct police now out there arresting people for stuff that's legal in
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:01.000]  the US. I know there's all sorts of persecution of people that try to stand up for nationalism.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.680]  Yeah, I mean the European Union doesn't like people standing up for nation states. In fact,
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.240]  let me just quickly move on to this outcome back to that. The guy who's just been elected
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.280]  as the president of the European Parliament is a man called Martin Shultz. He was elected
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:22.600]  last week. It was the biggest undemocratic state chump you've ever seen in your life.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:27.760]  In fact, I refused to vote on it. I refused to take part in this farce. This was a presidency
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:33.160]  which was decided two and a half years ago. Now if you know the way the European Union
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:38.840]  parliament works, it sits for five years and you have a president who's term is two and
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.120]  a half years. So in the five years you have two presidents. The European Parliament is
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:50.520]  run by two big groups. You have the Socialists and you have the European People's Party which
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.240]  are the Conservatives. Well, they're not real Conservatives but they pretend to be Conservatives
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.960]  although they are completely Europhile and they would love more and more European Union
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.160]  to control people's lives. And the way it works is that for two and a half years the
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.680]  Conservatives can have their president of the parliament and then for the next two and
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.760]  a half years they buy those votes and the Socialists will then have their two and a
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.120]  half years in the presidency. So this guy Martin Shultz is the Socialist who's just
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:22.640]  become the president of the European Parliament. This man is a dangerous fanatic. More dangerous
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.840]  than anything you've ever seen before. I ask your listeners, go on YouTube, look at
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:33.760]  this man. He is a fanatic nationalist of the European Union. He's not known very well
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.680]  in Germany but this man will be known right across Europe within the next two and a half
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.880]  years. And in a way, it's the best thing that could have happened to us. It's the best thing
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.520]  that could have happened to you, Kip, because some of us are just coming to the conclusion
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:51.880]  that waste is better. This man is the new face of Europe. Believe me, believe me, Alex,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.160]  you'll be hearing a lot more of Martin Shultz in the next two and a half years. He's a very
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.760]  dangerous individual.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:02.160]  Well, I've noticed that whenever you're speaking or Nigel Farage or others bring up real issues
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:08.280]  they laugh at you. And they're so arrogant and they just radiate criminal light from
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:13.800]  their eyes. I mean, you know slimy criminal types when you see them. And these members
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:20.920]  of the bureaucracy know that you guys are ceremonial. And they arrogantly sit there
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:21.920]  and laugh at you.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.280]  You're just meant to be there. So folks think that they're electing their leaders in the
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:32.160]  superhero. And I think that their hubris is something that backfires on them. And they've
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.200]  got to realize from Copenhagen imploding to so many other issues that time is running
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.200]  out for them.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.080]  Well, the man who does most of the laughing, well it's not laughing really, it's most of
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.480]  the shouting is actually Martin Shultz. He's sitting there opposite Nigel Farage and he's
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:53.160]  shouting fascist at them and he's screaming abuse. One trying to pull them off, but actually
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:59.320]  there's real anger there. There's real hatred. It's a feeling that you surely can't be criticized
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.560]  in the European Union. This is his beloved project. Now this is the same Martin Shultz
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:08.760]  who's now been elected to be the president who should be impartial. An impartial president.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.960]  But we know he can't be impartial because it's not in his nature to be so. He's a very angry
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.920]  little man. He's also the same man who one of our members was throwing out a couple of
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:24.240]  months ago for having serious words. This guy is a pretty poor individual. He'll be
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.000]  a pretty poor president. But the good thing for us and the good thing for you guys on
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.040]  the internet is that you will now see the true face of the European Union because everything
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.880]  which is wrong in politics is represented by this man.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.720]  What are you expecting to see them do next? I know that the Davos crowd announced last
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:50.680]  year they want 100 trillion in taxpayer money to give to themselves in banker bailouts.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:57.420]  Now they're announcing that they're looking forward to the new system run by the bureaucrats
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:03.140]  that they're saying will get rid of outdated capitalism when it's been their insider crony
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.600]  capitalism that's actually caused the problems.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.240]  And I mean, now they're really dispensing with any pretext that this is democratic.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:18.040]  Yes, they are. And as I said earlier, you're talking about two EU technocrats who are now
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:24.320]  the prime ministers of great nation states. In fact, the cradles of democracy, if you
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.280]  want to call it that, or the cradles of civilisation, Greece and Italy, they are doing away with
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.320]  every sort of pretence that we have democracy here. I mean, look, they're going to be
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:40.960]  talking in a summit next week, and what they'll be talking about is full fiscal union. What
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:45.200]  they're going to try to do is to prop up the euro, save the euro through full fiscal
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.880]  union. When the peoples of Europe aren't even being asked whether they want this in
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.080]  the first place, the peoples of Europe are being side-stepped again. These are deals
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.400]  which will take place in smoke-filled rooms behind closed doors. They're doing away
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:04.480]  with any pretence of democracy altogether. The big problem that the EU has, the big elephant,
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:11.040]  the white elephant in the room, is the euro, because the euro itself cannot survive. It
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.880]  cannot survive certainly in the current state that it's in, and probably Greece, Italy,
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:22.160]  Spain, Portugal, maybe Ireland. We'll all have to fall off the euro in the end.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.880]  And they're going to do everything they can to try to prop it up, and that'll really
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:30.320]  expose them. Member of the Parliament, EU Parliament from England, from the UK, Paul
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.080]  Nuttall, thank you so much for the time, sir.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.880]  All right, there he goes. And you can just type in UKIP and find the main party website
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.640]  there. But they're fighting over there against these globalists as well. Ron Paul has put
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:47.360]  out a statement on Rand Paul. Rand Paul is in the air. He should be back in DC soon on
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:50.360]  the TSA trying to grope him. Big controversy.

[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:27.360]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity

[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:41.000]  Okay, if you go to Ron Paul 2012.com, you can get his statement on what happened to
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.280]  Rand Paul running into the little federal goons who worked for the government, the criminal
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:53.440]  elements that stage 911. Ron Paul campaign statement concerning TSA abuses, the TSA gropes
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.240]  and grabs our children, our seniors and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.360]  while doing nothing to keep us safe.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.160]  Lake Jackson, Texas, the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign released the following statement
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:10.800]  concerning TSA abuses, like the ones that resulted in US Senator Rand Paul being inconvenienced
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:17.440]  at the Nashville, Tennessee airport. Below, please find comments representative Ron Paul.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:22.200]  If you want full quotes media, we've got the Ron Paul interview on the TSA. We talked about
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.920]  how he's been groped at mfallwars.com. The police state in this country is growing out
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.560]  of control.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:34.520]  One of the ultimate embodiments of this is the TSA that gropes and grabs our children,
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.280]  our seniors and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities. The TSA does all this while
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.360]  doing nothing to keep us safe. This is why my plan to restore America in addition to
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.460]  cutting $1 trillion in federal spending in the year eliminates the TSA.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:53.160]  We must restore the freedom and respect for liberty that once made America the greatest
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:35:02.600]  nation in human history. I am deeply committed to doing that as President of the United States.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.000]  And this TSA is the big deal because if they can get away with this and violating the Fourth
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:17.640]  Amendment and sell it on the back of the idea that we've got to protect you from any danger.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:22.600]  Whether it be champagne corks that kill over 100 people a year, look it up, or a Almanac,
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:27.240]  or honeybees that kill several hundred a year, or deer that kill several hundred a year.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.760]  Not just running out in front of your car, but sometimes deer actually kill people with
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.600]  their antlers a couple times a year, or on and on and on.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.480]  There's thousands of things more dangerous than terrorism, and most of the terrorism
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.920]  is provocateur or flat out staged. But since when did land of the free home of the brave
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.320]  say, the terrorists are so scary cuz they have beards and turbans on their heads, that
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.840]  we're gonna overthrow the entire Bill of Rights of Constitution and say you can't travel unless
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.000]  the TSA says so.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.300]  There's no more due process, we're just gonna do this. This is the type of bull that makes
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:09.040]  my blood boil. And of course, they're saying that they didn't detain him. All they ever
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.880]  do is lie about groping kids. They're always saying, I had people on the street come up
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:19.080]  to me and go, Alex, the TSA has stopped groping children, they've made the announcement.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.400]  And I get emails like that, I'm like, they've made that announcement over and over again,
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:31.160]  they keep doing it. Just like they said, don't worry, Obama's gonna veto the NDAA. And I
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.920]  said, no, he's not, he's gonna sign it. How do I know? I know their playbook. He said
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:42.840]  he would veto it, so you wouldn't politically make an issue out of it.
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:49.120]  Now Ron Paul has introduced legislation to repeal it. The sections that end posse comitatus
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.200]  and put troops on the streets, that allow them to black bag anybody they want, have
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:57.440]  he disappear forever. That allow a worldwide war without Congress. I mean, this happens
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.480]  in every other country. A bunch of crooks get in and run wild and commit a bunch of
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.000]  crimes.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.560]  That's always the first phase. Then they get scared that the people are waking up, so they
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.240]  try to bring in a total tyranny. And if it looks like they're about to get arrested,
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:17.200]  they'll start a big war to try to get everybody to rally around them and do what they're told.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:24.640]  Now I'm gonna open the phones up a little bit before Baron Von Notthouse joins us, the
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.560]  head of the liberty dollar. Illustrating the police state, he'd been in coining silver
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.440]  and gold commemorative coins for more than three decades. I remember watching his Royal
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:43.680]  Hawaiian Mint ads when I was a teenager, 14 years old, laying around watching television
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:50.300]  on the weekend and thinking, boy, those Royal Hawaiian coins look neat.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:55.680]  He was the owner of that. And for, I don't know, 14 years, he issues the liberty dollar,
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:00.480]  silver, gold, and copper coins. And his whole thing is about the Federal Reserve being a
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.300]  fraud, and we should all get into gold and silver. Totally legal, totally lawful. But
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:07.400]  what's wild is, in fact, guys, I forgot to tell you to print this for me.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.840]  Just type in just department statement on liberty dollar conviction. So I wanna read
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.040]  that, it's on the FBI website. Just department statement on liberty dollar, and it's on the
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.200]  FBI website. And they say these people are terrorists, those that try to use alternate
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.880]  currencies are enemies.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.160]  And we will infiltrate, frustrate, and destroy them and all this. I mean, it's like they're
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:36.000]  talking about real criminals or something like themselves. And they've got these kept
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.400]  federal juries that are total frauds and convict 98% of those that go before them. Just total
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.520]  kangaroo, many cases paid off, criminal, hardcore criminals.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:52.200]  No justice at the federal level, just sickening grand juries that work for narcotics trafficking
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:56.320]  murderers. I mean, that's basically what the government is. I mean, the troops publicly
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.520]  grow the opium now and tell you on the news, and people are like, well, that's patriotic.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.080]  They can't even hide it anymore. So what do they do? Well, just put it on BBC and Fox
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:10.380]  and CNN and ABC Nightly News that the troops grow the opium. And it's loaded on C130s,
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.360]  but they don't talk about that.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:22.000]  Again, I'm living in a total twilight zone. And he's facing sentencing next month, and
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.160]  he's calling for people's help. So we're gonna have him pop in for about 20, 30 minutes,
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:32.320]  then I'll continue with your calls. But it's really getting to me. I guess in years past
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.560]  at night having a couple glasses of wine and eating a bunch of barbecue or whatever was
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:45.040]  a way to sedate myself. But now running eight miles a day and cutting my calories in about
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.080]  half or more and cutting out alcohol and things.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:40:00.180]  I mean, I feel like I did when I was about 20 years old. And maybe I can't handle it
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:08.360]  because I am just really getting angry. And I'm sick of it. I mean, I am just getting
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:13.840]  so angry at the New World Order. But I'll tell you who I'm really angry at. It's all
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.640]  these people that even as everything we warned you about comes true exactly like we said
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.360]  it would.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.180]  Do you realize how horrible it's gonna get after this? This is nothing. This is just
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:29.080]  the preparatory getting all their system lined up. It's like when you're gonna make a big
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:35.860]  dinner for friends that are coming over. And you go to the grocery store, you get the food,
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:39.120]  you unpack it, you chop up the vegetables, you get the meat ready.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:46.920]  You get the marinade ready for the meat, you make the salad, you put out a tablecloth,
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:55.840]  you put the plates down, you put the napkins there. You go out the backyard, cut some flowers,
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:08.240]  make a bouquet, put some jazz on, wipe some candles. And the New World Order lit the candles,
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.640]  folks, they're done.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.200]  They're just waiting for dinner time. Of course, you know what's on the menu, right? All the
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:20.120]  rest of our freedoms, liberties and dignities, humiliating bondage. You know that folks live
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:27.400]  under bondage, it's horrible. And the financial bondage of having no future. I hate seeing
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.400]  opportunity destroyed.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:34.360]  I hate seeing people working two, three jobs and can't get ahead. I don't like lack of
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.920]  prosperity. I don't like seeing people poor. I don't like seeing people empty. I don't
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:58.440]  like seeing people unhealthy. I don't like seeing where all of this is going.
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:04.120]  And the worst part is seeing how unconscious the average person is. Even if they know the
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:10.280]  government's out of control and big corporations control it, they still think that's somebody
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:16.240]  else's problem or there's nothing they can do about it. There better be something you
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.560]  can do about it.
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:25.120]  And there is. See, I wanna tell people that serve the system something and then I'm gonna
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:43.280]  get into more news. I wanna explain something to people. I wanna try to get something across
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.280]  to you. You like to steal money and you like to sit around all day and you like insider
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.400]  scams and good old boy deals.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:57.960]  And you rationalize that, well, the money is just gonna go to somebody anyways and that
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:02.920]  you're going to buy things in the economy. So you got it all figured out. But the problem
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:09.280]  is you can't stand up against other forms of corruption that are greater than what you've
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.280]  done.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.600]  Because if you do, the more corrupt people will simply blow the whistle on you. In fact,
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:20.960]  give me a document cam shot please for people that are watching on prisonplanet.tv. A sharpie
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:24.360]  would be better, but I can do this with a regular ballpoint pen. I'm gonna show people
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.320]  how this works, okay?
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:33.560]  Okay, let's say here's a midline of people that will not engage in corruption. And we're
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:41.020]  seen as the schmucks, the idiots, the suckers, the morons. The hard working people are seen
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:52.480]  as idiots by the corrupt. We're seen as marks. We're seen as basically cannon fodder. But
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.880]  it's a step up process.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.440]  Those that are a little corrupt, they think it's not gonna hurt anything. And then there
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.200]  are those above them that engage in a little bit more corruption. It's kind of stairs leading
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:13.560]  upwards or downwards. And at each level though, people that go along with corruption always
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.020]  tend to be self centered.
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:22.120]  They're not deeper, more wisdom filled creatures. They think they can engage in a little bit
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:29.680]  of cheating. And the next person thinks that, and the next person, the next person, the
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:36.160]  next level as you go upwards in the continuum of corruption. But by the time you get up
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.120]  here, you're dealing with total sociopaths.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:45.060]  The time you go up a few steps, you're dealing with just completely corrupt individuals who
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:50.920]  either don't care or who are sadistic and actually enjoy abusing people and like doing
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:59.520]  bad things. And then you've also got psychopaths who just have no connection to reality. And
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.680]  then you've got these master controller types who know what they're doing but wanna be in
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:09.600]  control and see everybody as animals so they'll do anything.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.000]  And think that they're gods. Yeah, that's a good point. John just popped in my ear and
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.800]  said and think that they're gods. Yeah, the globalists play with us like our whole world
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:25.680]  is their little toy. And watching us squirm and doing things and social engineering. And
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.880]  these guys up here control the fractional reserve banking system.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.520]  So they control the symbol of energy money that they get out of nothing. And then the
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:42.800]  whole world at every level will sell out their own mother down here for chicken feed these
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:52.240]  con artists made out of nothing. But at every level of this corruption continuum, it's got
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:59.920]  all these tentacles going down sucking off the general population.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.320]  If the lower level ever has a conscience or thinks what's happening up here is destructive
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:10.880]  or nihilistic, this level can simply destroy the next level with the dirt that they have
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.080]  on them. Because most people on this level will go along with destroying that person
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.600]  because they don't wanna upset the apple cart.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:25.280]  And it's the same at every level right down the line. So what this creates is a acceleration
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:34.200]  of corruption. Because the most devious, manipulative and ruthless will automatically ascend this
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:43.040]  continuum of evil. And no one in the lower levels can say no to people in the higher
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.920]  levels as they escalate to corruption.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:47:00.320]  Because they're all in on it. And of course, what does this create? It creates a society
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:09.280]  of pure death. It creates a collapse of the general society. So the globalists understand
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:16.160]  all this. So they've created a cosmology on record that they call a post-industrial world
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:19.320]  where the standard of living is lowered.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:25.320]  And being poor and the language being reduced and the art being reduced and destroyed, all
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:32.760]  this ugliness and everything is sold as beauty. So it's not survival of the fittest as they
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:40.840]  say raising the species, it's actually lowering the species. And that's the fruits of this
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:55.240]  system. And it is a race to the bottom. It is a giant sucking sound, not just of jobs
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:48:00.400]  but of our families and of our morals and of everything we are.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:10.120]  It is death. The New World Order at the end of the day is all about death. Because you
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.800]  see in this continuum, in this competition for who can be the most destructive and the
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:27.960]  most evil. These globalist I guess kind of enter into a type of insanity. I mean, that's
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:34.040]  what it is when they've got 50,000 plus nuclear weapons globally aimed at everybody.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:39.640]  And they've got GMO giant factories everywhere splicing organisms as fast as they can giving
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:48.200]  rise to super viruses, bacteria, the list goes on and on, microplasms. And every disease
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:53.720]  you could imagine being weaponized and stored in facilities that are designed to basically
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:49:02.440]  release them at one point. And radiation levels rising and all of the fruits of this system
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:10.120]  metastasizing.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:15.080]  And then those of us that don't like the death, that don't like the evil, that don't like
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:24.600]  the fraud, that don't like the corruption. The FBI, Homeland Security, ADL, Southern
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:31.040]  Poverty Law Center, corporate dinosaur media, they run around talking about how horrible
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:34.920]  we are, and how extreme we are, and how bad we are.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:46.000]  Because we see what they are. And we see that the system has seized control of all of humanity
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.760]  and is pulling us down. And that there's only one way to get out of this and that's fully
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:57.320]  waking up and facing the horror and dismantling the system. You can't dismantle this system
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:59.120]  by partially waking up.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:05.320]  Now, partially waking somebody up is a solution because it can lead to a full awakening. And
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:14.680]  nobody's gonna wake up overnight. But if you really wake up and look around you at what's
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:21.560]  going on, and if you look at the trajectory of every form of corruption and despotism
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:27.040]  accelerating and getting exponentially worse, you see where it's going.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.840]  I mean, I don't know how long I told you this was coming. EU agrees to Iranian oil embargo.
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.680]  They said a member of the EU parliament on saying it's going to effect right now. Iran
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:44.800]  definitely closing Strait of Hormuz over EU oil embargo. Afghan soldiers killed four French
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.100]  troops over US Marine urination video.
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:51.520]  All you neo cons that thought it was cute and said, what's the big deal? Well, it got
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:56.260]  troops killed. That's why it's a big deal, Donnie. US aircraft carriers delivered direct
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:51:02.680]  message to Iran. It's all coming up.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:07.740]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick. That's

[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:16.300]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:20.180]  makes the same light as a real television. So from outside, it looks like someone is
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:25.120]  home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:30.400]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:34.680]  by numerous police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:42.920]  TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake TV is
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:48.140]  only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:57.800]  of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com. Faketv.com, the burglar
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:07.800]  deterrent.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:14.480]  The system knows that this whole TSA thing is a powder keg. The social engineers also
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.900]  know that it's something that unifies people across political lines. That's why the White
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:24.920]  House has come out against Rand Paul and Ron Paul on the TSA issue. That's why I've been
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:31.840]  covering it so much. This is key, cuz it's gonna be everywhere, schools, highways, roads.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:37.360]  It's the international sign of you are the slave, my hand's going in the pants. Total
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:43.240]  prisoner enslavement conditioning system. More on that in a moment, a bunch of other
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.240]  news.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:51.840]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. I wanna get your take on all
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:58.280]  these issues that I've been covering. I get so focused, I think you've noticed the last
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:08.400]  few months on air that I hardly ever plug books, videos anymore, or even our sponsors.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:14.840]  I am dumbfounded many times now just by the insanity I see unfolding. But a big part of
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:19.400]  the solution is waking people up in films like Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:25.240]  Endgame, Terror Storm, Invisible Empire, boy, that's a good one. Films I've directed and
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:27.440]  produced all available at Infowars.com.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:31.240]  We've also got a lot of other books and videos we're carrying by other great directors and
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:37.000]  researchers like Noble Lie, the Oklahoma City bombing film, excellent, just out. We've got
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.160]  a lot of other great books and videos on the site. The new film, Indochtro Nation, about
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.320]  the brainwashing in public schools. Get these tools, your purchase supports the broadcast,
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:50.040]  it's part of it, but more importantly, it's a tool to wake others up.
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:56.240]  You can get all my films for 70 plus percent off at Infowars.com. And the everything special
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:01.400]  that's gonna end at the end of the month, 70 plus percent off, 99.95. We got a 15-day
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:06.600]  free trial right now at prisonplanet.tv, where you can also see the nightly news and more.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.980]  Putting a lot of energy into that, and it's another key tool in the fight.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:15.200]  So please think about us, and we couldn't do any of this without you. And we wanna continue
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.540]  at the level we're at and expand. So I wanna thank all of our sponsors and listeners and
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:26.840]  folks that visit the online video bookstore. There's also apparel there on the site, infowars.com.
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:34.960]  A classic Hill article from the White House. White House aides come out and side with TSA
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:42.280]  and Rand Paul Standoff. And they go on to say that we followed our procedure. Yeah,
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.280]  they had procedures in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia gulags too.
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.840]  I remember Bush, when he talked about torture and defendant, he'd say, these are professionals.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:56.640]  And he'd say it with this little twinkle in his eyes. It's so professional, what we're
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:02.440]  doing. You study criminology, it's always very professional. How the tyrant, it makes
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:08.000]  it okay if it's a professional. The White House is standing by the Transportation Security
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.360]  Administration in its standoff with Senator Rand Paul and his father, Republican presidential
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.360]  candidate, Representative Ron Paul.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:20.060]  The elder Paul called the TSA a police state Monday, after Senator Paul was reportedly
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:25.840]  detained by TSA after he refused to take a pat down from the TSA officials at the Nashville
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.480]  International Airport. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that he didn't have
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.320]  any reaction to Paul's comment about police state.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.040]  No, you just had the president sign a law that every constitutional lawyer has said
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.200]  is the ultimate police state, secret arrest, disappearance of citizens. You don't know
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:46.840]  anything about that, do you? Or the tens of trillions your bosses helped steal for foreign
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:52.840]  banks from US taxpayer money. You don't know nothing about that, do you?
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:58.880]  But Carney sided with the TSA, said, I think it's absolutely essential that we take necessary
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:03.400]  actions to ensure air travel is safe. Kinda like all your highway checkpoints, make sure
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:08.840]  we stay safe from you, the criminal government. Representative Paul, who was one of four remaining
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.360]  Republican candidates for president, disagreed Monday afternoon.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:18.360]  Paul said, after he confirmed the incident involving Senator Paul on his Twitter page,
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:24.800]  that it showed why the TSA should be eliminated. And he went on. See, they hate it, they wanna
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:29.560]  pass their TSA garbage and have us just lay out and take it. And they're NDAA and have
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:33.760]  us lay out and take it. They want us to all just act like it's normal, but by fighting
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:38.440]  back, we expose just how outrageous these crooks are. Stay with us, third hour coming
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.440]  up.

[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:59.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:04.620]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:10.240]  you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:14.880]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:20.280]  overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:29.080]  their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:33.640]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:37.340]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:43.720]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government

[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:20.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:34.760]  You know, last Thursday with Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul, we first talked about this and
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:40.520]  Kurt Nemo wrote a story saying, hey, what's happening in Iowa? The media there is saying
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:46.280]  that the election outcome is in question, but that Rick Santorum is now the winner of
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:48.200]  Iowa.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:55.240]  But then, it just fades off into history. And then over the weekend, CBS News reported,
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:01.120]  and I'm gonna get a special article out on this later at infoawarsk.com. It says estimated
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:15.360]  Republican delegates scorecard, and it says Ron Paul, zero delegates. And then another
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.960]  one that says Ron Paul, three delegates.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:26.800]  So it's very, very, very, very, very, very strange that now they're just talking about
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:33.560]  Ron Paul not getting any of the delegates. I mean, how could Ron Paul, here's the CBS
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:49.740]  read they're getting from the state of Iowa, Romney 19, Santorum 12, Paul 3. So there's
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:02:00.240]  this mystery, and then no one is even asking, well, okay, who does get the delegates?
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:09.880]  And I mean, that's the crazy part about all this, just huge things happen all the time.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:19.560]  And it's just move along. But then if some football player cracks a nail, you'd think
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:25.520]  space aliens had landed in Central Park, the story's so big. Now, I know we've got loaded
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  phones here. For 20 minutes, we're gonna have Bernard Von Nothouse, the owner of Liberty
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.280]  Dollar, who's been convicted and is facing sentencing.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:41.280]  He has been gone for a long time for issuing silver and gold coins, something totally legal.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:47.640]  Even the Associated Press, when he got convicted last year, said, we read the law. It clearly
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.920]  isn't against the law what he did. The Wall Street Journal even said it was a miscarriage.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:03:00.120]  But it didn't matter, they've got grand juries that will convict anybody, federal grand juries.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:04.080]  I mean, again, do you really believe 98% of people, it was like 96 a few years ago, now
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:09.680]  it's 98 nationally. 98% of people that go to court with the feds go to jail, and the
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.900]  feds love that.
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:14.840]  That's why they'll ship cocaine in and heroin and ship guns out and get caught, not get
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:21.200]  in trouble, because they're murdering gangsters, folks at the top. These are hardcore criminals,
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:29.720]  the magnitude of which makes the head spin. And I keep just going back to that. I mean,
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:38.840]  they think we're so dumb that they just engage in all sorts of incredible crimes and then
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:40.720]  just declare national security.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.560]  What we have is a mafia that owns and runs our military through fraud that declares national
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:54.360]  security and diplomatic immunity. And of course, it's coming out in the news that Ron Paul
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.680]  and Rand Paul, members of Congress, have immunity under the Constitution. Of course, the Bill
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:04.440]  of Rights gives you immunity to these out of control searches, but the White House says
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.440]  it doesn't matter.
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:11.720]  Now, here's Steve Watson's article, TSA directly violates US Constitution by detaining Senator
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.600]  Rand Paul and preventing Kentucky Senator Rand Paul from flying to Washington this morning.
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:21.520]  The TSA directly violated the law as written in the US Constitution. Yeah, they say he's
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.680]  gonna miss some votes now.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:29.480]  Yeah, well, they can put him on a no fly list, they say, and he'll never fly again, no judge,
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:33.880]  no jury needed.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:38.640]  And we got Article 1, Section 6 up there. I'm gonna cover that when we come back and
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:48.800]  then we'll go to your phone calls. After Von Noethaus leaves us, we'll get to Ed, Chris,
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.920]  Janice, CJ, and others coming up.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:58.840]  PrisonPlanet.tv and M4wars.com are the websites.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:06.960]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.800]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.760]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.800]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:28.280]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:33.760]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:39.440]  sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:44.680]  with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,

[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:07.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:12.640]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:17.600]  from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president and
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:24.080]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:29.360]  citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:34.960]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:39.000]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.120]  matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:49.720]  nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the republic. Get
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:56.280]  your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watch it online right now
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:02.800]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.040]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:11.400]  Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:15.280]  than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:19.560]  this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:24.840]  from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:30.720]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:34.960]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:39.560]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:48.600]  survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com. Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:57.600]  877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:07:59.800]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:07.080]  This is communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.640]  a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:17.200]  Under a tyranny, legal activity is made illegal and the criminals legalize their criminal
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:24.560]  activity. Tyranny is just government by criminals, by gangs. Now this article is key at infoawards.com
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.880]  and nobody's really pointing this out. The White House has weighed in and says good job
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:37.060]  detaining Senator Paul. The Congress has already become ceremonial. Rand Paul is trying to
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:44.280]  change that and take back the constitutional powers on war, you name it.
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:50.000]  But the TSA directly violates US Constitution by detaining Senator Rand Paul. See, why does
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:58.040]  the UN have diplomatic community? Well, out of our common law, that's how they claim that
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:07.280]  power that they're voting. And so if people detain them or people persecute them, that
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:10.960]  could stop them from carrying out their office.
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.080]  And that because their work is so important, there's always criminal intrigue to try to
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:21.320]  set them up if they're not going along with what a different part of the establishment
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:29.200]  wants. But to boil it down very simply, in the Constitution, during the House or Senate
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:38.320]  being open for business, you cannot arrest or detain a senator or representative. I'm
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:39.320]  gonna read this.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:44.480]  A lot of people don't know about this, but this is diplomatic community basically. Now,
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:49.840]  as soon as that is over, then it can be looked at. But I'm gonna read you from the Constitution.
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.880]  Now again, you've got these pot-bellied nobodies. They got legislation in Congress where they
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:57.300]  quit calling themselves officers. They're not officers, they're not trained, they're
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.720]  not bonded, they've had a background check.
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:05.440]  You know about them robbing bags, all of it. We're going to our guests here in a moment.
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.520]  TSA directly violates US Constitution by detaining Senator Rand Paul and preventing Kentucky
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:16.020]  Senator Rand Paul from flying to Washington. And he is gonna miss some votes this morning.
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:20.300]  The TSA directly violated the law as written in the US Constitution. But what did Bush
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:25.920]  call it, a GD piece of paper? The Constitution specifically protects federal lawmakers from
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:35.520]  being detained while en route to Washington DC. Article 1, Section 6 states, the senators
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:39.880]  and representatives shall in all cases, you hear that?
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:44.840]  The senators and representatives shall in all cases, this is just the law of the land
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:48.200]  though, folks, yeah. The law of the land says pot-bellies can't be sticking their hands
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:53.200]  down your pants without warrants, but they do it. The senators and representatives shall
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.600]  in all cases accept treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from the arrest
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:05.600]  during the attendance at the session, you hear that?
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  Of their respective houses and in going to and returning from the same, traveling to
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:18.320]  and from their district. Rand Paul was traveling from his home in Louisville to attend a session
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:25.480]  in the Senate today. This is the reason the TSA officials, not servants, have since put
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:29.440]  out the talking point to the media that Rand Paul was never officially detained.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:32.560]  These are the same folks that said they weren't strip searching old ladies and now admit they
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:35.520]  were. The same folks should always say they're not strip searching little kids, but they
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.280]  admit they are. Despite the fact the senator himself confirmed that he was told to sit
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:46.960]  in a cubicle and wait without any indication of whom and when he would be allowed to leave.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:53.240]  The Senate is back in session at 2PM and votes are scheduled for 4.30. Senator Paul was allowed
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:59.900]  to board a second flight after a second screening by a TSA agents. However, it remains to be
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:04.040]  seen whether he will make it to the Capitol in time.
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:09.440]  Well, the Fourth Amendment says that they can't secretly arrest us and have us disappear,
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:14.280]  but they've signed a law saying they can't. Which is no one void Marbury versus Madison
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:24.920]  and hundreds of other federal rulings. In all crimes, we're entitled to a jury, but
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:25.920]  you disappear.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.800]  Do you get one with the IRS? Do you get one with CPS? They've created fake courts for
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:36.760]  the IRS, fake courts for the CPS. It's all fraud, stinking criminals. They're the criminals.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.960]  You're like, so what, do they violate the Constitution? Look at all the tyranny that
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.580]  comes along with it. I wanna tell listeners something and we're going to our guest. This
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:49.760]  is life and death. This is hardcore. This is real.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:53.600]  What have you done today to fight for liberty? What have you done today to wake somebody
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:59.640]  up? We're on over 100 AM and FM stations across the United States. If you're listening to
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.960]  a local AM or FM, stop your car at the red light. Tell people to tune in right now. Put
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:07.200]  flyers up all over your neighborhood.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:15.260]  I mean, people need to hear this. Tell your friends and neighbors about mfallwars.com.
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:20.760]  Get Fall the Republic, make copies of the DVD, put it on local access TV. I mean, we've
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:25.220]  got the most hardcore info. We need you to help us reach more people. I'm not risking
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:30.040]  my life and getting in these tyrants faces because I'm playing games here.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:37.700]  I'm going 110% straight on into them and I need your support. We're all in this together.
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:41.760]  We have got to get a buzz going. There's already a huge buzz for liberty. We've got to up it
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.200]  and then redouble it and redouble it again. You should be doing banner hangs every day
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:50.480]  on the way to work. Wild horses shouldn't be able to drag you away going and getting
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:55.920]  a white canvas and spraypaintinginfowars.com on it or whatever site you think is important.
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:00.720]  Or start your own stinking site and mirror our site or other, I don't care, fight, fight,
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.480]  fight. Wake people up because everybody else is angry too. The vast majority of people
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:07.280]  are awake, they feel like they're alone.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:14.720]  We got to create such a buzz for Ron Paul, everything else. Get aggressive now. Now,
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.000]  your calls are coming up after our guest leaves us, but he put out an email for aid. He's
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:29.120]  a great patriot, been on many times, so we've got him on. Baron von Notehouse. Bernard von
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  Notehouse. I like that. I knew his name was Bernard, but I've been interviewing him for
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:35.120]  like 15 years.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:41.240]  And on my guest sheet, it says Baron von Notehouse. It kind of sounds like a guy would have a
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:45.800]  name who'd be a Baron though. It's a cool name. It says Baron von Notehouse. It keeps
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:51.000]  saying Baron. I'm like, his name's Bernard. And sure enough, yeah, it's Bernard von Notehouse.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.160]  That's a funny one.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:15:05.760]  But getting back to this, this is from the federal government's own website. And we'll
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:16.360]  put it up on screen here right now with the FBI seal on it. This is what the federal government
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:29.520]  put out the day that Mr. Notehouse was convicted. This is the Western District of North Carolina,
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:36.960]  FBI Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Attorney's Office, March 18, 2011, Western District of
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.960]  North Carolina.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:44.200]  And of course, they waited a long time, almost record time for sentencing because the media,
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.000]  even the AP, even the Wall Street Journal said they read the statute and what he did
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.520]  was not illegal. Printing your own gold and silver coinage. He didn't advertise it as
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.200]  US government or Federal Reserve stuff.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:03.600]  Let's see, he put out Ron Paul coins, folks, so he had to go to jail. And here's their
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:12.880]  press release about Bernard von Notehouse. Now, listen to what they say here at the end
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:18.000]  and we'll scroll down to the bottom. Attempts to undermine the legitimacy and legitimate
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.800]  currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism.
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:28.480]  You wonder what they're gonna use the NDAA on and all this? Here it is. US Attorney Tomkins
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:34.640]  said in announcing the verdict. But the good news is everybody who looked at this knows
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:41.500]  he didn't break the law. But they have kept juries of servile demons who will send anyone
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:43.160]  they're told to jail.
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:47.800]  The 2% of the time you're not convicted is when one hand doesn't know what the other's
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:53.120]  doing and you're some government narcotics trafficker and they just let you off. While
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:58.120]  these forms of anti-government activities, I'm reading from their statement. While these
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:02.360]  forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, so they're saying it's illegal
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:05.680]  to be anti-government when your government's a bunch of criminals.
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:09.100]  While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:13.920]  as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country.
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:19.520]  I thought it was the foreign banks imploding our economy and NAFTA and GATT. She added
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:25.040]  a danger. We are determined to meet these threats through infiltration. This is a guy
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:31.640]  publicly advertising on national TV, they infiltrated. Disruption and dismantling of
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.240]  organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government.
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:41.800]  Yeah, don't challenge the government and we'll put you in jail for challenging the legitimacy
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:48.000]  of the government. See, we're saying you're illegitimate and they're saying no, no, no,
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.560]  we're not illegitimate, you're going to jail. You don't like the government shipping guns
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:18:00.920]  into Mexico? We'll just arrest you. And they go on to celebrate how many years he's facing
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:01.920]  prison.
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:04.960]  Bernard Von Nothehouse, good to have you on, we're about to go to break, but you're facing
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:09.440]  sentencing soon. And I guess they sleep good at night knowing how many people they send
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:10.440]  to prison here, buddy.
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:13.080]  Bernard Von Nothehouse Probably better than me, Alex.
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:17.480]  Bernard Von Nothehouse Yep, well, what's the saying about when tyrants run things, the
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.000]  patriots rot in filthy jails?
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.080]  Bernard Von Nothehouse I think that's the case.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.400]  Bernard Von Nothehouse Well, we're about to go to break and it was
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:32.240]  a long intro there, but how can we help you? I guess we plead on the judge who sits on
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:37.720]  top of this fake court and ask their lordship not, I mean, the judge should have mistriled
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.960]  it right there. I mean, I think they waited eight, nine months to do this because obviously,
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.680]  as you know, the news media, even the establishment dinosaurs read the code and said what you
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:47.680]  did wasn't illegal.
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:50.000]  Bernard Von Nothehouse Actually, Alex, we're at a critical stage
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.880]  in the trial right now because I'm facing sentencing up to 22 years. And so I've asked
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.880]  people who support the Liberty Dollar and the ideas that it represents, in other words,
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:06.680]  honest gold and silver money, to actually write a letter to Judge Voorhees asking him
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:12.440]  either to dismiss my case, or to sentence me to no prison time. And if people really
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:17.960]  want to do that, and they want to help, then they should actually email me very simply
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:26.360]  bernardatlibertydollar.org. And I will reply with the judge's address. But we do need people
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:31.520]  to write as many letters, doesn't have to be long, short is good. But it comes down
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:38.240]  to show a popular support for the cause that Liberty Dollar exemplifies that is, write
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:39.240]  the judge.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:45.840]  And by the way, hundreds of cities, towns, private groups have their own money. I mean,
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:50.120]  that's what gift cards are. But but but you put out a Ron Paul coin, so you need to go
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:56.480]  to jail for 22 years at taxpayer expense. And they've got people calling you a terrorist.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:58.480]  We'll be right back.

[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.840]  so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:17.120]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead. Here's why. Solar power
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:21.760]  generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:26.680]  sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:32.280]  it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:36.840]  electricity from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:41.480]  your own home. Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer

[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:13.760]  So imagine, for decades and decades have had the Hawaiian Royal Mint issuing commemorative
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:23.040]  coins. You start the Liberty dollar, you promote gold and silver private currencies, totally
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:30.480]  illegal. What's illegal is creating a counterfeit of US dollars, which is what the Federal Reserve
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:34.480]  did. You don't have a US dollar, you have a Federal Reserve note. So it's funny, they're
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.080]  accusing him of what they're doing.
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:42.020]  He never acted like he was a US government currency. It was all about don't trust the
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:48.840]  corrupt Federal Reserve currency. And so they went into their little jury and they say here,
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:56.320]  he's a terrorist. And they go, okay, 22 years in prison as a terrorist for 14 years putting
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.560]  out gold and silver coins.
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:02.680]  And again, we covered this at the time, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press. In fact,
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.480]  I was shocked, they rarely get something right. They went and looked at the code and law and
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:17.020]  said this guy didn't break the law. They don't care. They don't care. So Bernard Von Notthouse
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:24.320]  is our guest. How big of a wake-up call has this been of them coming out and saying you're
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:25.320]  a terrorist?
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:32.920]  It's been a huge wake-up call, Alex, because the people have really been shocked by that
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:39.640]  statement that you read earlier by Ann Tompkins. And what's amazing is that they had that statement
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:46.480]  whiz-bang ready to go when the verdict came in. It was like almost, they knew that I was
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:53.000]  gonna be found guilty because the guilty verdict came in at about 10 o'clock in the morning
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.480]  and they issued that in the early afternoon.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:00.200]  I mean, boy, that was awfully fast work for the federal government.
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:05.920]  Well, they're good people, Fast and Furious and Agent Orange and the government grows
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:12.520]  the opium in Afghanistan on record, but they're good people. Now, continuing, if you've got
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:17.520]  the contact info for the judge, for people that have been involved with Liberty Dollar
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:24.240]  especially to contact the court as is customary and to make comment on sentencing, how do
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:25.240]  folks do that?
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:30.600]  Well, actually, Alex, that's a very important and critical part of the whole process that
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:34.800]  I've been through. And of course, that's the sentencing. The government's trying to get
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:42.560]  the judge to sentence me to 22 years in prison. So we've been asking people if they're, they
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.440]  don't have to have been involved with Liberty Dollar, maybe they just want to take a stand
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:54.120]  against the tyranny that the government is saying that we did, you know, saying that
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.680]  the Liberty Dollar was counterfeit. So if people want to take a stand, they should write
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:07.840]  to the Honorable Richard Voorhees. That's V-O-O-R-H-E-E-S. And he's a district court
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:17.240]  judge. He's in the western district of North Carolina. The address itself is 250 Charles
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:26.640]  Federal, Charles R. Jones, J-O-N-A-S, Federal Building. I think you could just send it to
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:32.360]  the federal courthouse and it would get to him. The street address is 401 West Trade
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:40.540]  Street. That's in Charlotte, North Carolina, 28202. Or they could just send me a quick
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:46.120]  email, bernard-at-liberty-dollar, and ask for the information, and I'd be happy to
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:52.360]  reply to that, you know. But it doesn't take a long letter, Alex. This is really a
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:56.400]  show of force in terms of people in the community that support Liberty Dollar and the ideals
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:59.800]  it represents. In other words, honest gold and silver money.
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:03.280]  You know what's funny about the feds? They're not happy enough to have stolen all the gold
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.280]  and silver and copper. Turned out you had bigger supplies than you were even supposed
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:12.160]  to to back it all up. That's not enough for them. They want you to get the maximum
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:17.720]  sentence of 22 years. That's some bad karma these folks are piling up for themselves.
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:22.560]  Well, they obviously are trying to bury me. There's no doubt about that. I mean, as
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:27.720]  you pointed out earlier, there are hundreds of other currencies out there in a lot of
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:33.680]  different communities across the United States. The empty cow has been out there since 1991,
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:40.760]  so this is simply nothing new. But the idea of having a local currency, a private currency
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:47.520]  that's 100% backed up by gold and silver, that is what I think really scared the hell
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:50.480]  out of our favorite federal government.
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:54.480]  Well, yeah, no, cuz they work for foreign banks. This isn't the federal government.
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:58.040]  They're the banksters and you were one of the biggest outfits out there and so they
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:03.480]  just made you a political prisoner. Or they're about to try to do that. And I guess that's
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:09.800]  you mean the NDAA. I mean, you're an American terrorist and they say so, so you disappear
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:10.800]  now.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:17.160]  Yeah, I'm already qualified for the NDAA Alex. I mean, I've already been declared a terrorist
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.480]  and they might come and get me at any time. I could hear him knocking on the door.
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:29.200]  And they sit there like it's a police state comic book or something. We're in the future
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:35.360]  in America. He issued their own currency and we're arrested. I want to do a few more minutes
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:38.680]  with you on the other side with any points you want to make in case this is one of the
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:44.000]  last times we talked to you before you disappear into the labyrinth of the giant prison system,
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.880]  one of the biggest in the world, run by our narcotics trafficking, murdering criminal
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:50.720]  so-called government.

[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:12.040]  Others don't. You know, I can make a joke out of it, but it's not funny because it's
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:19.000]  actually happening. Don't you think for a minute, you domestic terrorist, that you're
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:24.080]  going to set up a coin company and issue your own gold and silver coins?
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:28.260]  Don't think for a minute you're going to set up a commemorative mint. Sure, there's hundreds
[02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:32.460]  of companies doing it. There's hundreds more that have their own private local currencies
[02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:39.120]  and it's totally legal. They don't care. The feds have got juries that are kept juries that
[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:47.560]  they kept seated that will convict anybody in America for anything. They will do whatever
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:54.720]  they are told, 98% conviction rate, and then they'll have US attorneys come out.
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:01.400]  And no, they're not writing for a Hollywood script of a remake of 1984 or The Running
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:09.520]  Man or some other dystopic THX 1138. No, they're serious. Attempts to undermine the legitimate
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.720]  currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism. The Federal Reserve's
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:17.280]  got its name on all the money.
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:23.420]  It is counterfeit. Didn't have it till 1913. They've used it to debase the country. Kennedy
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:31.340]  tried to reissue Lincoln Greenbacks and was killed. All of this is going on. All of this
[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:37.720]  is happening. And they sit there with a straight face talking about Bernard Von Nothouse the
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:40.640]  same way they should be talking about themselves.
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:48.880]  I mean, you've heard all the constitutional lawyers I've had on saying Obama signing NDAA
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:55.840]  is treason. I mean, real treason, not just throwing that name around. But of course,
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.220]  the tyrants are telling us that we're the bad men. Attempts to undermine the legitimate
[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:03.200]  currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:08.960]  US Attorney Tomkins said, in announcing the verdict, the FBI put this out as a press release.
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:14.680]  They want to scare us. All these forms of anti-government, see, none of Homeland Security's
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.960]  about Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda works for them on record. While these forms of anti-government
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:25.560]  activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious or secret, the TV ads
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:29.680]  he had running, and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:31.600]  this country, she added.
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.640]  We are determined to meet this threat through infiltration, disruption, and dismantling
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:41.000]  of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.280]  I thought the government was overthrowing the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I thought
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:51.260]  that's what was happening. So he's facing sentencing coming up next month, 22 years
[02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:56.560]  in prison in the, just like the feds sent advisors into Illinois and to the state.
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:02.800]  And they all went down last year in that case where the guy filmed cops towing his cars
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:09.940]  away and stuff, Mr. Allison. And they actually put briefs in and said, we want him to serve
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:14.760]  life in prison, yes. And the judge went, you know what, I'm gonna dismiss this. But if
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.360]  he wouldn't have dismissed it, that state jury, they think it's good to put somebody
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:20.360]  in prison.
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:24.160]  They go in there and they get off on it, and the cops come in and the prosecutor pats them
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.960]  on the head. And they go, who do we screw up in prison? They're like, don't worry, we're
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:32.120]  gonna put some innocent people in there. And they all get real excited. You think I'm joking?
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:38.040]  I remember when a listener called me, and we're going to Mr. Note House, then your calls.
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:45.640]  Kelly rushing in Lyon County, Kentucky. This is about eight years ago now. And he said,
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:50.260]  Mr. Jones, I'll send you the newspaper clipping. I'm facing three counts, three years apiece
[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:51.760]  of terroristic threats.
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:56.120]  I gave a state police officer road to tyranny. They're charging me for that, but also the
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:02.800]  Ron Paul speech on there. I put that on, I'm charged with both. And so he faxed me and
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:06.040]  then mailed me the newspaper and I saw the judge. I called the judge at home. Back then
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:10.280]  I was naive eight years ago. I thought, come on. So I get the judge on the phone and I
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:15.360]  go, well, I'm not gonna get too much in the case, but the newspaper, you're actually not
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:21.640]  mistrailing somebody facing nine years in jail for giving a cop a video?
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.320]  And he said, I'm not gonna talk to you about it, but yes, it's going to court. So then
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:32.760]  they had the hearing. And the cop comes in and says, he gave me that video and it's anti-government.
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:37.680]  And the judge says, we find that threatening, you will convict, and the jury didn't. And
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:41.600]  it was in the news, but they actually wanted to put him in jail for going officer.
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:46.240]  In fact, the cop even testified, this is important for your future and your family's future.
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:50.720]  And they said that was a threat, mentioning family, but yes. And they all sat there with
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.920]  a straight face. I mean, these are kook, cult, demons, hardcore evil. I mean, these people
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:04.360]  are flaming scum. I mean, just wild, crazy, dangerous people, just like the Nazis, the
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.720]  Soviets, all of them.
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:11.440]  Pole pot killing 31% of Cambodia, murdering anybody that could read or write or wear glasses.
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:18.000]  You're like, why did he do that? Cuz he's a flaming loon, they like it. You like water
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:24.720]  skiing enchiladas, hanging out with your family, mountain biking? They like black uniforms
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:32.040]  and torturing children. They do it all over the world. I'm sorry, Bernard, you know what,
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:35.680]  it makes me totally, you're the one facing, I know I'll be facing it too, they'll trump
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:36.680]  something up.
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:41.840]  It doesn't matter though, I've already heard them bad. But anyways, they're the terrorists
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:47.440]  and they know it. And you know what, I mean, I hope people contact the judge. But I mean,
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:51.520]  the fact that the judge wouldn't even mistrial this to begin with. I mean, what do you think
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:55.360]  of this judge overall? I know you've tried to say nice things in the past, throw yourself
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:00.720]  on his godly mercy, our little tyrant leader.
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.080]  But I mean, what are you facing here, 22 years? What do you do to his lordship?
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:12.560]  Well, actually, I think the judge was straight up in the trial. And I think that he may have
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:22.320]  been shocked as I was in terms of the verdict. The judge, I think, presided over a fair and
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:29.920]  honest trial. But I think that the jury certainly erred very seriously. I mean, they were only
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:36.120]  out less than an hour. You can read different opinions and different articles, but trust
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:42.200]  me, Alex, I was there. I was watching the clock. And it was just about an hour, a little
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:49.600]  less than an hour that the jury was out. And this is on three very serious federal offenses,
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:55.040]  counterfeiting, obviously. And they found me guilty on all three counts in less than
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:59.920]  an hour. I mean, they couldn't even read the jury instructions. The jury instructions
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:05.920]  were 72 pages. They couldn't even have read the jury instructions in an hour. And of course,
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:10.960]  if they had read the jury instructions, then they would have known that we made an extremely
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.280]  strong defense in terms of no mens rea.
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:16.280]  There was no criminal-
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:20.000]  No, no, no, all these juries care about, the federal ones, is the cash they get on the
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.280]  side. It's been proven in many cases. But in others, it's just they're mentally ill
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:29.520]  authority worshipers. And all they care about is the satisfaction of seeing you convicted
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:33.720]  and having the prosecutor nod at them with a little psycho goody look.
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:38.040]  And it's that little psycho enjoyment. So they go back to their miserable houses, their
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:43.360]  miserable lives, their scum-filled existence. It's just all about abusing good people. It's
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:44.360]  a demonic celebration.
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:49.360]  Well, I really don't know much about the jury, to be honest with you, because I don't know
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:57.760]  much about North Carolina. But I do know that the majority of jurors were unemployed. And
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:07.600]  so obviously, they didn't care about taking time. I mean, they were getting paid.
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:12.160]  No, that's why they're lazy scum. Yeah, a lot of us, they're just lazy. Exactly, y'all
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.160]  just prison, nab scum.
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:22.240]  Well, whatever they did, they certainly surprised me because I thought that I was going to be
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:28.360]  found not guilty. I wasn't even planning on staying the whole day. But as it turned out,
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:34.760]  they immediately launched into the forfeiture hearing. I mean, within 15 minutes after I
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:42.000]  was found guilty, they convened a hearing to fluff it all over. Now, we're talking about
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.600]  nine times here, Alex.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:48.520]  And this is people's property on record, a private bank account, kind of like MF Global.
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:53.760]  Well, it isn't a bank account, but it is their private property that was being held by a
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:54.760]  server.
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:56.800]  Well, sure, that's my point is that they have certificates of it.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:57.800]  Absolutely.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:58.800]  It's their account.
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:41:59.800]  Absolutely.
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:02.120]  That's how banks started is you'd have gold and silver in a place so you wouldn't get
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:05.240]  knocked on the head, then you'd have paper that you could receive it as you know.
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:10.000]  The point is that they, and that's theirs because they're the good government.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:17.680]  Well, that's what they're saying. And there is a motion before the court for the judge
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:25.880]  to give them the dibs, if you would, prima facie evidence that they have right to all
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:30.560]  the seized property. Well, that's not going to go anywhere. There's also another motion
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:36.040]  before the judge, which is our post-trial motion, which is asking him to dismiss the
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:41.680]  case because the jury erred. So if anybody was going to write to the judge, that would
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:48.720]  be an extremely good thing to ask him, is to approve our motion and dismiss the case.
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:57.240]  Either that or give me no prison time while I appeal the verdict, because we will certainly
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:43:02.960]  appeal this trial, Alex. Well, that's good news. Now, I guess you'll
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:06.840]  be clapped in irons, though, while the appeal goes on, because the feds will probably say
[02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:11.240]  you're dangerous or something. Well, they may say I'm dangerous, but I have
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:18.160]  been out this whole time, which is about two and a half years or so now, on an appearance
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:26.080]  bond. And even though they did try to violate me on the appearance bond once and threw me
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:33.840]  in jail, the judge let me out. So I would say there's a very good chance that I would
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:40.800]  be released on my appearance bond pending appeal. It is unheard of. Dismissing the case
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:48.000]  is all but unheard of, but being released so I can actually fight for the appeal is
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:53.360]  pretty good, Alex. But the bottom line is, is that right now I'm facing sentencing.
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:44:00.480]  I don't know what's gonna happen at sentencing. Dismissing the case is all but impossible.
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:04.040]  And when is that coming up in February, the hearing with the Kangaroo Court?
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:09.420]  Well, that just did. They haven't set the time for the sentencing yet, but we're coming
[02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:13.840]  up to the first anniversary. Can you imagine it's been a year since I was convicted, Alex?
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:17.680]  I mean, it's been a long time. Okay, cuz your email to me, I thought it
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:20.440]  said February. I guess you're guessing that's when it's gonna be?
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:25.560]  Yes, that's what we're projecting is that that's what the court is hinting at, that
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:31.760]  it could be February. And it could be later than that. We don't know, but we know that
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:38.440]  we're getting close. And we know that we gotta fire up the troops to actually write the judge
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:43.720]  and ask him to dismiss the case or no prison time.
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:45.040]  Wow. Wow.
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:50.440]  All right, we will continue to talk to you as this unfolds. Bernard Von Nothehouse, thank
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.720]  you so much for joining us. I appreciate it, Alex. I'll send you that info so that you
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:59.320]  can post that to where the people can actually contact the judge then.
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:01.720]  Yes, sir. Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:08.400]  Thank you, my friend. It just makes my blood boil. I remember when they first raided them,
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:12.960]  took their gold, silver, and copper. And he was kinda laughing about it whenever he was
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:17.880]  going to court. Because, I mean, he's doing what literally hundreds of companies have
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:20.200]  done for hundreds of years.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:28.840]  But he was popular and supporting Ron Paul. And I said, man, they're gonna convict you.
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:35.400]  I mean, this isn't a real government. There's no justice. There's no laws with these people.
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:40.080]  They do what they want. The one thing holding them back is they haven't recruited enough
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:45.080]  criminals. They're recruiting criminals into government as fast as they can and trying
[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:47.760]  to kick out the good people.
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:52.920]  And right now their global masters are trying to teach them to be confident. And so they're
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:57.960]  showing them with Fast and Furious and the government growing the drugs in Afghanistan
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:03.520]  and publicly shipping it into America. They're kinda showing everybody to the troops, look,
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:04.520]  we're allowed to do this.
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:08.520]  We're on Fox and the troops are all going, you want us to talk about it? I thought this
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:17.360]  is classified. No, it's time to go public. And that's kinda like Congress. They're like,
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:22.600]  so DynCorp runs child kidnapping rings. They're like, yes, we're allowed to. And they're like,
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:23.600]  okay, well, it's now public.
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:29.840]  I mean, it's just pure mega maximum evil out in the open, totally just out of control danger
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:38.480]  zone. With a bunch of compartmentalized morons running around on the bottom acting all serious.
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:43.040]  It's like it's important to hen peck the general public and suck every dime out of us you can
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.880]  cuz your bosses tell you the country's gonna go bankrupt if you don't raise more revenue.
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:55.600]  When the revenue is all sucked out of the nation faster than you can whistle.
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:59.200]  It doesn't matter though, you just gotta experience it. Those of you that wanna serve this system,
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:04.120]  you're gonna have to just experience it. So drink more tap water, give your kids more
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:15.440]  shots. Bisphenol A products, aspartame, MSG, you know what, don't believe me. I'm a kook,
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:18.980]  I'm the bad man, you're right.
[02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:22.240]  And it's good to ship guns into Mexico and drugs back in as the government's been caught
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:27.080]  doing. And it's good to have the troops use DU and it's good to take their pension funds
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:32.040]  and it's all good then. Okay, great. Let's go to Ed in Texas, Ed, you're on the air,
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:33.040]  welcome.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:38.280]  Yes, Alex, this is Ed Fox 777, great to talk to you.
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:39.280]  Hey, buddy.
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:45.880]  Yes, I have a really important question and I was wondering if you can explain or rationalize.
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:51.400]  Why is it that it's the senior citizen conservative voters by majority who are once talked to
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:55.920]  us when growing up to read the Constitution, get into politics.
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:01.640]  Now don't listen to the young voters who by majority follows Ron Paul and the senior citizens
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.280]  who just cares about their retirement checks threatened by Obama.
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:11.240]  It doesn't matter though, hey, all those seniors are gonna have that money devalued. You already
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.280]  see 80 year olds out there working everywhere. All these people that go along with socialism
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:17.760]  and try to keep their retirement, they're not gonna get it anyways. So don't worry,
[02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:20.800]  they'll be judged by their own greed, they're gonna lose it all.
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:27.560]  It's what they want, believe me, they're gonna get it. But let me expand, they like feeling
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:32.600]  like they're winners. They think Fox News is their friend while Fox News puts out Christmas
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:38.880]  cards making fun of them as dumb sheep. And so they are literally watching television
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:42.320]  in a mesmerized state, they're zombies.
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:46.740]  And so they don't care about Mitt Romney's for abortion, open borders, gun control and
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:52.800]  carbon taxes. They're told they're winners and that they're trendy when they vote for
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:57.480]  him. So they feel powerful out on the golf course and like they're part of the winning
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:48:58.480]  team.
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:03.100]  It's like a bandwagon thing. And so they feel like the New World Order is winning and so
[02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:06.120]  they're signed on to it. Do you understand that?
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:12.480]  Yes, sir. But the talking points like Ron Paul is gonna have drug addicts on the streets
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:14.680]  or destruction of Israel or-
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:20.520]  Look, unfortunately, most of these older folks line up and get mercury filled shots even
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:27.560]  though three of them flu shots on record doubles your chances of Alzheimer's. They love it.
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.840]  I mean, they're lining up to be killed, they want it. They want mommy government to smash
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:38.160]  their brains out, and it is. They wanna be hurt bad, and it is. It happens in every culture,
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:41.120]  they want what they're gonna get.
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:46.320]  And they're gonna get it. They want tyranny, they want World War III, they want bondage,
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.040]  they wanna be starving in the street, they'll get it. They want their dollar devalued down
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:55.720]  to nothing, they'll get it. They'll get it all. Have you ever been around these federal
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:56.720]  prosecutors and people?
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:00.960]  They're a bunch of chicken neck power tripping people that watch cop shows all night when
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:04.120]  they get home. And they wear little suits and they're all into themselves and going
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:10.400]  to the courthouses acting all powerful and stamping around, little fake world. I mean,
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:16.520]  the general public, the older folks, young people, whoever's into the system is in a
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:21.680]  make-believe world. I watched the Secret Service on TV with Obama, all acting tough and like
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:22.680]  they're looking around.
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.620]  And it's all about this little play land of they're real men and they're talking into
[02:50:26.620 --> 02:50:31.640]  their little vest thing. It's all ridiculous. The President runs nothing. It's all theater.
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:40.600]  It's a matrix. It's all fake. And it's all coming down. And our only chance is to warn
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:46.720]  people ahead of time about everything that was going to happen. So that as it all unfolds,
[02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:51.520]  as we've said, that will cause the Great Awakening. But people are going to have to be in a lot
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:57.240]  more pain first. They're going to have to have everything taken from them. That's what
[02:50:57.240 --> 02:51:03.560]  the tyranny is about is totally bankrupting everybody.

[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:22.520]  It's been a pretty nutty show today. We've had Nuthouse and Nuddle on. That's a joke
[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:27.320]  Chris just said. You got to have some gallows humor. I'm sorry I've been ranting so much
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:31.700]  today. The audience seems to like it, but it's not on purpose. It's just the level of
[02:54:31.700 --> 02:54:37.540]  corruption is so ridiculous and it's getting worse by the second.
[02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:41.160]  And you've got people that are waking up, but some saying you can't affect any change,
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:45.220]  others that are waking up that are taking action. And this big sea of people that just
[02:54:45.220 --> 02:54:52.140]  have no idea what's even going on. Look at this article, Mexican state bordering US deadlier
[02:54:52.140 --> 02:54:57.000]  than all of Afghanistan last year, the Justice Department's own numbers.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.860]  But that's not a problem. Let's leave the border wide open. Again, out of sight, out
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:09.020]  of mind. They tell you they're doing all this to keep you safe from terrorists. All on record
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:14.360]  prescription drug interactions are killing over 300,000 a year. Flesh eating bacteria
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:19.240]  are killing hundreds of thousands a year in complications.
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:25.720]  They know about all the real crises. I mean, think of how crazy it is to say we're federalizing
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:34.120]  and setting up checkpoints all over the United States. Because a terrorist might strike a
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:40.420]  cornfield or a highway somewhere. The idea that they can just randomly search people
[02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:41.420]  is ridiculous.
[02:55:41.420 --> 02:55:50.700]  All right, I got a bunch of callers here. I meant to get to more calls today. It does
[02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:55.780]  make my head spin though. Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Texas. Chris, you're on the
[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:56.780]  air.
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:59.580]  Hey, Alex, Al-Qaeda Jones, how's it going today?
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:05.740]  Good, I had a real Al-Qaeda on earlier. The feds say he's a domestic terrorist because
[02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:09.980]  he issues his own gold and silver and exposes the Federal Reserve.
[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:15.020]  Well, of course, what do you expect from the Nazi government we have nowadays?
[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:18.780]  All I know is how much are they gonna get away with? I mean, they are really putting
[02:56:18.780 --> 02:56:20.780]  it in our face right now.
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:26.060]  Yeah, well, I need to get rid of Congress and start with a new batch, starting with
[02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:31.220]  the gene pool from the Paul family. I think that'd be good. I did have one quick question.
[02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:40.500]  If you could pull up for the NDAA, the 1022 and 1031 sections. Actually, the 1022 section
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:43.540]  looks like it does exclude US citizens from being detained.
[02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:46.700]  If you could expand on that or read that and-
[02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:53.420]  Yeah, the reason the ACLU, Ron Paul, myself, that section points to another section. So
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:57:00.340]  when you repeal that section, it removes the other section. And so again, it was written
[02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:06.580]  to be deceptive, but the senators admit it's designed for US citizens and ends posse commentatis.
[02:57:06.580 --> 02:57:10.580]  I don't have it in front of me in the few minutes we've got left. We don't really screen
[02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:13.980]  calls, so I didn't know you were calling in about that subject, or I would have had time.
[02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:18.220]  I mean, go to the ACLU's website. Ron Paul's broken down. We've written articles breaking
[02:57:18.220 --> 02:57:24.900]  it down. But see, they'll say, this doesn't affect US citizens, except in this case, if
[02:57:24.900 --> 02:57:27.340]  the president says so.
[02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:33.840]  It's kinda like US code title 50, chapter 32, subsection 1528, paragraph B. It says
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:39.500]  the government can't do any secret chemical, biological, or radiological testing on you.
[02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:44.660]  But then it says unless, it mentions another section, and then in that section, it says
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:49.460]  unless it's for research purposes. Well, if it's for research, go ahead and shoot kids
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:54.260]  up with syphilis or spray chemical weapons on troops and kill them, which they admit
[02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:55.540]  they've all done.
[02:57:55.540 --> 02:58:01.620]  And then the public goes and looks at the code and doesn't know what they're reading.
[02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:05.700]  It's like a non-disclosure act. People will read it and say, well, it says here that after
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:10.420]  my termination that I'm free of this, except for sections listed here. And then those are
[02:58:10.420 --> 02:58:16.820]  the sections. It's written in lawyer speak. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:19.340]  Does that answer your question?
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:25.540]  Yeah, well, it actually does say that it does not extend to them, which is US citizens.
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:31.380]  Okay, so I mean, I've been over this over and over again. And I mean, I can pull up
[02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:36.340]  the subsections and show, okay, it doesn't affect citizens. Okay, why is Obama killing
[02:58:36.340 --> 02:59:03.380]  US citizens then without any type of trial? I mean, what are you talking about?
