[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.280 --> 00:23.520]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.520 --> 00:29.480]  Hello on this Friday, 621. This is David Knight, and we are here live in Austin, but Alex Jones
[00:29.480 --> 00:35.280]  is not here. Actually, Alex is working on the next big blockbuster, the next installment
[00:35.280 --> 00:40.160]  of the Obama deception. You know, it's very important, these documentaries, people ask
[00:40.160 --> 00:45.640]  why we cover Hollywood, why we review films, why we do documentaries. In a documentary,
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.700]  you can lay out the facts in a way that you just don't have time to cover it on the news.
[00:49.700 --> 00:53.360]  So we can cover what's happening, and it's important that you know what's going on, keep
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.200]  your ear to the ground, and keep informed. But when you really want to understand what's
[00:58.200 --> 01:03.360]  behind the news, when you really want to get the broader and deeper picture, nothing does
[01:03.360 --> 01:07.660]  that like a documentary. So we're all about documentaries here. As a matter of fact, we've
[01:07.660 --> 01:13.960]  got an exclusive on State of Mind, which is a new documentary coming out from the people
[01:13.960 --> 01:21.560]  that brought us The Noble Lie, which was a expose of the Oklahoma City bombing. State
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.600]  of Mind, the psychology of mind control. And if you pre-book that right now, you get a
[01:26.600 --> 01:32.400]  free copy of The American Dream. It's a great cartoon version that explains what's going
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.840]  on with our banking system, how we got into this mess, follows the money trail. It does
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.640]  it in a very fun, very informative way for people. It's a great way to wake people up.
[01:41.640 --> 01:45.680]  But you know, the mind control thing is also very important. It's important for people
[01:45.680 --> 01:51.080]  to understand that this is something that is not just, you know, tinfoil hat conspiracy
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.560]  stuff. This is something that's been going on for a long time. It's been discussed, it's
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.720]  been released in classified documents that have been declassified. The government's been
[02:00.720 --> 02:08.040]  working on this since the 50s at least. And this is something that is in our second hour.
[02:08.040 --> 02:14.400]  We're gonna have on the show Dr. William Pepper. And he is actually defending Sirhan Sirhan.
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.260]  You might think that's an open and shut case. Actually, it isn't. There's some new evidence
[02:19.260 --> 02:27.040]  that was brought to light by some advances in technology in 2004. They discovered an
[02:27.040 --> 02:31.360]  audio recording that had not really been analyzed before. And they didn't really have the technology
[02:31.360 --> 02:37.200]  to analyze it before 2004. But with this new technology, with this new recording, they
[02:37.200 --> 02:43.360]  heard that there were not just eight gunshots. That is what could be held from Sirhan Sirhan's
[02:43.360 --> 02:49.120]  position, but actually 13. And so we're gonna be talking to Dr. Pepper. And he was also
[02:49.120 --> 02:58.120]  involved in a trial of James Earl Ray, the accused assassin of Martin Luther King. And
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.220]  he never had a trial because he confessed. Seems like they always managed to get people
[03:03.220 --> 03:10.000]  to have a confession, plea bargain them down to a life in prison or something like that.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.160]  So they don't have to have a trial, so there's no discovery or discussion of the evidence.
[03:14.160 --> 03:19.040]  And that's what happened in James Earl Ray's case. And he never had a trial, but this was
[03:19.040 --> 03:24.480]  the trial that he never had. And it was done as a television trial with Dr. Pepper. And
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.560]  the King family wanted to have this trial done. And we'll be talking to him about the
[03:29.560 --> 03:34.500]  revelations of that. We've also got Paul Joseph Watson coming up in the third hour. And we're
[03:34.500 --> 03:40.400]  gonna be talking about this breaking case of Michael Hastings in LA.
[03:40.400 --> 03:47.520]  And it has all the hallmarks, in my opinion, of a bomb and not a simple car accident. It
[03:47.520 --> 03:53.800]  just doesn't look like any kind of car accident, any kind of fire. Fiery crashes are very rare.
[03:53.800 --> 03:58.840]  You typically don't see the engine ejected at a 90 degree angle. There's a picture of
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.440]  it up there on the screen. You don't see the kind of damage to the front end that's going
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.140]  to cause the fire to start. Fires in cars that are fatal typically happen because someone
[04:09.140 --> 04:14.520]  crashes it into a wall and gets pinned into it and the engine catches fire. Well, the
[04:14.520 --> 04:19.400]  engine was ejected. There wasn't that much damage done to the front end. And the engine
[04:19.400 --> 04:24.280]  was ejected at kind of a 90 degree angle from where they were. That's not typical in crashes
[04:24.280 --> 04:30.640]  and it's not typical of a new Mercedes. They really do have some pretty good technology
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.960]  in terms of keeping the engines in the cars, believe it or not. That's kind of where they
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.480]  hang their bailiwick is on the safety issue. And they do it as good as anybody else, if
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.120]  not better. So we're gonna be talking to Paul about that in the third hour. Stay tuned.
[04:43.120 --> 05:00.960]  We'll be right back.
[05:00.960 --> 05:17.280]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us? As we've moved through
[05:17.280 --> 05:18.280]  history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.280]  dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.820]  compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine. We are kept in
[05:23.820 --> 05:29.160]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback
[05:29.160 --> 05:33.120]  loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total
[05:33.120 --> 05:37.000]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast. You need to be ahead of
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.160]  the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.240]  endorse but demand a war. I'll have another one. Another plane just hit. State of mind

[08:53.920 --> 09:12.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I am David Knight filling in for Alex. I will be
[09:12.920 --> 09:16.440]  here the first two hours. The third hour we are going to have Jakari Jackson and Paul
[09:16.440 --> 09:21.440]  Joseph Watson. Now we are going to go through the news here in just a little bit but you
[09:21.440 --> 09:26.300]  know I actually, it is amazing what we do for our listeners. I actually threw myself
[09:26.300 --> 09:32.060]  on the sword last night and went to see World War Z. Yeah, I actually paid to see that.
[09:32.060 --> 09:36.740]  And we are going to have Alex talking about his anticipation of it because he had read
[09:36.740 --> 09:44.120]  the book. He knew what the book was about. Actually Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio
[09:44.120 --> 09:49.760]  got into a bidding war as to who was going to be able to film that. And Brad Pitt won,
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.440]  for better or worse. And they actually made something called a movie out of that, I guess
[09:54.440 --> 09:59.000]  you could call it. But Alex talked about the themes that were in the book. He talked about
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.220]  early releases of the script. And I can give you a review. I will talk about the political
[10:06.220 --> 10:10.320]  aspects of it. I will tell you right now that there are movies that you see that you really
[10:10.320 --> 10:13.520]  like. And then there are movies that you see and you say, you know, I could have waited
[10:13.520 --> 10:20.160]  to see that and seen it on Netflix or on cable. And then there are movies like, how did I
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.480]  waste two hours of my life? Well, World War Z is in that last category. I want my two
[10:25.480 --> 10:30.160]  hours of my life back. Not even the money that I wasted, I just want the time I wasted
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.320]  back. It was not even entertaining from the standpoint of an action film or a horror film
[10:35.320 --> 10:41.920]  or a suspense film or a science fiction film. It didn't deliver on any of those aspects.
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.040]  And just kind of if you've seen the previews, you've seen the special effects shots. You've
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.280]  seen the mass of humanity piling on top of each other like a bunch of ants. And that
[10:51.280 --> 10:57.080]  kind of sums up the whole attitude of the movie towards mankind. But we'll talk about
[10:57.080 --> 11:01.680]  the political underscoring of that. And that's why we do film reviews is because it's important
[11:01.680 --> 11:08.360]  to understand how powerful film is because it acts on not just an intellectual level,
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.160]  but it also acts on a subliminal level. You know, film is so effective because it manipulates
[11:13.160 --> 11:22.160]  our emotions at the same time that we're looking at what's on the screen. Movie soundtracks
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.280]  are so important, so much of a part of manipulating your emotions. But it's just a very visceral
[11:28.280 --> 11:34.640]  entertainment medium. And it really is able to deliver very deep messages to you, very
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.640]  subliminal messages. So it's important to take a step back and to look objectively at
[11:39.640 --> 11:44.420]  what is actually in these films. And we're gonna be doing that a lot more here at InfoWars.
[11:44.420 --> 11:49.680]  And Alex has a film review comparing Superman to World War Z. We're gonna play that at the
[11:49.680 --> 11:54.560]  bottom of the hour. And I'll follow up and tell you how they changed it from what was
[11:54.560 --> 12:00.240]  anticipated. But we've got in the news, of course, we're still looking at the Hastings
[12:00.240 --> 12:06.240]  death that happened in LA. The FBI, these are some headlines on InfoWars. The FBI is
[12:06.240 --> 12:10.500]  saying that there's no investigation involving journalist Michael Hastings. Well, I guess
[12:10.500 --> 12:14.980]  which investigation are they talking about? Are they talking about the investigation where
[12:14.980 --> 12:20.640]  he tweeted just hours before he died that he was being investigated by the FBI? Or are
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.680]  they talking about they're not going to investigate the strange appearance of the car accident?
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.560]  It's probably the latter. Ted Cruz is launching a national petition against the Gang of Eight's
[12:29.560 --> 12:37.360]  bill. He said, this is have to stop this immigration bill. He said, they're going to grant amnesty
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.560]  to 11 million illegal immigrants. You know, there's kind of a pattern of behavior that
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.280]  you see with the government. They'll go in and do the illegal as Henry Kissinger said,
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.160]  the illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little bit longer. They'll go in over
[12:51.160 --> 12:57.040]  and over again violate the law. And we're seeing that happening now with the NDAA. They've
[12:57.040 --> 13:02.040]  released a new version of the NDAA for 2014. And what they're doing is they're putting
[13:02.040 --> 13:06.280]  in provisions. We've always been upset about this indefinite detention provision section
[13:06.280 --> 13:12.920]  1023. They're now proposing another section that is going to give them legal cover for
[13:12.920 --> 13:18.620]  the kind of data collection, data mining, data storage that we all know that they've
[13:18.620 --> 13:23.940]  been doing for a long time secretly, illegally, unconstitutionally. And so now they're going
[13:23.940 --> 13:28.720]  to pass a law to do that. Same thing is happening with illegal immigration. We know that it's
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.320]  illegal, but they're trying to pretend that it's not illegal. They do it even though it's
[13:32.320 --> 13:36.640]  against the law. They don't enforce the laws. They break the laws. And then eventually what
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.720]  they do to cover themselves, they amend the laws. And that's what we see is really happening
[13:40.720 --> 13:46.600]  with the illegal immigration act right now. McClatchy Washington bureau reports that government
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.800]  could use metadata to map your every move could use. They've been doing that for a very
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.320]  long time. Uh, we've got another one here. Lawyers are eyeing the NSA data as a treasure
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.300]  trove for evidence in murder and divorce cases. And I guess you could make the case that if
[14:04.300 --> 14:09.880]  the government has information that's in a criminal case, if they have it in their possession,
[14:09.880 --> 14:15.760]  they should surrender that. And, uh, but they're assuming that once they have taken our private
[14:15.760 --> 14:22.160]  information, once they've stolen our private information, unconstitutionally illegally,
[14:22.160 --> 14:28.880]  then that information is now secure and belongs to them. We've got 25,000 dead bumblebees
[14:28.880 --> 14:34.120]  discovered in Oregon. This is the largest documented bumblebee deaths in the western
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.360]  U.S., according to a conservation biologist, Rich Hatfield. They said they've never seen
[14:39.360 --> 14:44.520]  any kind of die off of bumblebees on this scale before, and they're aware of a pesticide
[14:44.520 --> 14:50.500]  application vicinity but have not yet identified the active ingredients. Well, there's some
[14:50.500 --> 14:55.560]  people that have done some research on that. We've seen in other cases, people making cases
[14:55.560 --> 15:02.360]  that it is Roundup and some other chemicals and pesticides. We'll see what conclusions
[15:02.360 --> 15:08.800]  they come to. Seems like Monsanto, though, is kind of a special protected species. It's
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.560]  almost like an endangered species protection list that they've got. Nothing that Monsanto
[15:13.560 --> 15:24.840]  can do is basically ever called into question. And then we've got this story here about water.
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.800]  We've got a video that kind of lays this out. We're going to throw that in just a second.
[15:30.800 --> 15:38.580]  And it's a story about some people going before a water board and complaining about their
[15:38.580 --> 15:46.440]  cloudy water and foul-tasting water. And the person who's there basically tells them, don't
[15:46.440 --> 15:52.120]  make unsubstantiated claims because we'll treat that as terrorism. Let's take a look
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.120]  at that video.
[15:53.120 --> 16:11.360]  Do you have water problems? Do you want us to come test your water? Guess how many we
[16:11.360 --> 16:12.360]  got to say...
[16:12.360 --> 16:22.360]  Let me ask, is one phone call a sufficient investigation of such serious complaint?
[16:22.360 --> 16:27.280]  We called them and said, do you want us to come down and test your water? No.
[16:27.280 --> 16:29.280]  Were you called? Was anybody here called?
[16:29.280 --> 16:39.320]  Let me throw one thing out there just so you're aware. We take water quality very seriously,
[16:39.320 --> 16:49.120]  very, very seriously. But you need to make sure that when you make water quality complaints
[16:49.120 --> 16:57.600]  you have basis because federally, if there's no water quality issues, that can be considered
[16:57.600 --> 17:00.720]  under Homeland Security, an act of terrorism.
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.960]  Can you say that again, please?
[17:04.960 --> 17:12.480]  What I'm saying is if you've got concerns about your drinking water, that's very important.
[17:12.480 --> 17:21.280]  We take that very seriously. But under federal regulations, if you make allegations against
[17:21.280 --> 17:28.040]  public water supply that are unfounded, then that can be considered under Homeland Security,
[17:28.040 --> 17:32.320]  an act of terrorism, because you're trying to allege things...
[17:32.320 --> 17:35.800]  Who would you be in this case, Mr. Smith?
[17:35.800 --> 17:41.120]  I'm just saying, I'm not making any accusations.
[17:41.120 --> 17:45.200]  That's good. I hope you can hear that. The audio quality is not quite what we'd like
[17:45.200 --> 17:50.600]  to have, but you can hear that. He says, you got to be very careful because under federal
[17:50.600 --> 17:59.360]  regulations I can call you a terrorist if we do this. Just don't question your masters.
[17:59.360 --> 18:04.680]  You say something about the water quality. We've gone from being ridiculed and being
[18:04.680 --> 18:11.160]  laughed at. Back in North Carolina, we had some people at Planet Info Wars that got together
[18:11.160 --> 18:15.480]  in social networking. That's our Info Wars social networking site. They got together
[18:15.480 --> 18:20.000]  to decide they would do some activism back in North Carolina. And the first thing they
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.200]  decided they would do would be go down to city council and talk to them about fluoridation
[18:24.200 --> 18:28.560]  of the water. And they were not only laughed at and cut off, they wouldn't allow them to
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.900]  run a piece that had been run by a local news crew talking about fluoridation and seriously
[18:33.900 --> 18:41.040]  taking a look at why it's been outlawed in European countries and other places. And they
[18:41.040 --> 18:44.680]  would not look at the health effects of that. They would not consider the idea as to whether
[18:44.680 --> 18:48.720]  or not, even if it was effective, do you really want to try to medicate people through the
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.460]  water supply? Is that the way that you deliver meds is through the water supply? So they
[18:53.460 --> 18:59.120]  not only laughed at them, but they toasted them and mocked them with a glass of tap water.
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.960]  And now we've got officials in Tennessee saying, if you come in and talk about the quality
[19:03.960 --> 19:09.720]  of your water, I might just call you a terrorist. And he keeps throwing around the names of
[19:09.720 --> 19:15.120]  Homeland Security and federal laws as if that's supposed to scare people. Well, you know,
[19:15.120 --> 19:20.840]  we got something at the federal government. It's called the Constitution. And you don't
[19:20.840 --> 19:28.600]  amend the Constitution by passing an appropriations act for the military like the NDAA. They didn't
[19:28.600 --> 19:34.680]  amend the Constitution with Section 1023 by passing a law. If the law is unconstitutional,
[19:34.680 --> 19:40.640]  it's still unlawful. And all the assertions of that doesn't change. No matter how draconian
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.800]  they get, it doesn't change. It just shows that they are oath breakers and criminals
[19:44.800 --> 19:48.520]  if they violate the Constitution, especially when they pass a law. We'll be right back.
[19:48.520 --> 20:01.560]  Stay tuned.

[24:16.720 --> 24:20.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex. And we're going
[24:20.800 --> 24:25.280]  to have a very interesting guest coming up in the top of the next hour. We're going to
[24:25.280 --> 24:31.060]  have Dr. William Pepper. This is a lawyer, a human rights lawyer who defended Martin
[24:31.060 --> 24:35.980]  Luther King and is trying to get a retrial for Sirhan Sirhan. There's some interesting
[24:35.980 --> 24:41.440]  new evidence about the trial of Sirhan Sirhan that came about about nine years ago with
[24:41.440 --> 24:45.140]  new technology. And so we're going to talk to Dr. Pepper about that. We're going to talk
[24:45.140 --> 24:52.360]  to him about the trial that was held for James Earl Ray. They never had a trial before for
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.880]  James Earl Ray because he just pleaded guilty. So they had a trial at the request of the
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.420]  King family. Dr. Pepper is a close friend of the King family, was a very good friend
[25:01.420 --> 25:06.060]  of Martin Luther King Jr. before he was killed. And they really wanted to get to the bottom
[25:06.060 --> 25:10.900]  of this because there was a lot of questions about the circumstances surrounding his death.
[25:10.900 --> 25:16.340]  Just as we see, there's a lot of circumstances that are suspicious about the death of Michael
[25:16.340 --> 25:21.660]  Hastings in LA. This is something we covered a couple of nights ago on the nightly news.
[25:21.660 --> 25:25.560]  It's something we talked a great deal about yesterday. It's something we're going to continue
[25:25.560 --> 25:32.080]  to talk about because the government is just coming out and doing things like tapping people's
[25:32.080 --> 25:38.100]  phones and breaking every kind of constitutional protection that we've got is just being ignored
[25:38.100 --> 25:43.400]  openly now by the government. We were looking at the evidence of it the other day and Rob
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.260]  Jacobson had a great comment. He said they just really don't care anymore. I mean, it
[25:48.260 --> 25:52.740]  used to be that the government did these types of things in secret that they're doing in
[25:52.740 --> 25:59.780]  open today. And they used to try to hide when they violated the law, when they killed people.
[25:59.780 --> 26:04.080]  But now we've got books being written by a Pulitzer Prize winning author, The Way of
[26:04.080 --> 26:10.140]  the Knife. Mark Mazzetti just came out talking about how Obama and George Bush are using
[26:10.140 --> 26:18.540]  the secret service as well as, not the secret service, but the CIA as well as military in
[26:18.540 --> 26:24.940]  ways that they've never used them before openly and just open assassination against people.
[26:24.940 --> 26:31.200]  And we also have the NSA scandals as far as the breaking tips of the iceberg now that
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.760]  we're starting to see is something that we've known has been going on for quite some time.
[26:36.760 --> 26:40.740]  But now they're revealing little bits of it. We've got a video coming up here in just a
[26:40.740 --> 26:46.300]  few minutes. If you remember a couple of days ago, there was some amazing video from the
[26:46.300 --> 26:53.220]  USA pageant and this USA pageant. And they were asking them questions about these revelations
[26:53.220 --> 26:59.420]  about spying and data interception. And they were just fine with that. They had no problem
[26:59.420 --> 27:06.140]  at all with it. So we're wondering what would happen if they actually gave the right answer
[27:06.140 --> 27:10.740]  to that. And here's a short video about that.
[27:10.740 --> 27:16.260]  Judge number three, Nene Leakes. Your question, please.
[27:16.260 --> 27:22.780]  A recent report shows that in 40% of American families with children, women are the primary
[27:22.780 --> 27:29.540]  earners yet they continue to earn less than men. What does this say about society?
[27:29.540 --> 27:32.660]  Well Nene, it sounds like you're referring to an oft quoted but erroneous interpretation
[27:32.660 --> 27:36.740]  of a Census Bureau report that claims female workers earn 77 cents for every dollar made
[27:36.740 --> 27:40.500]  by a man. A wage disparity that mostly but not completely disappears when you contrast
[27:40.500 --> 27:43.980]  the relative earning power of both genders in equivalent occupations, which is why PolitiFact
[27:43.980 --> 27:47.900]  gave President Obama a rating of mostly false when he repeated this error on national television.
[27:47.900 --> 27:49.620]  Look, here he is.
[27:49.620 --> 27:56.820]  So to anyone who says 77 cents on the dollar sounds pretty close to equal, I say your math
[27:56.820 --> 27:58.780]  is bad.
[27:58.780 --> 28:00.780]  Thank you. World peace out.
[28:00.780 --> 28:04.140]  Thank you, Utah. Thank you, sweetheart.
[28:04.140 --> 28:08.020]  Okay, there we go. Well, you know, it's not just the government doing things that are
[28:08.020 --> 28:12.380]  illegal and doing it in our face, but it's also the way that they're interacting with
[28:12.380 --> 28:17.800]  people. As I said earlier in the show, I went to see World War Z last night, and just the
[28:17.800 --> 28:22.740]  us versus them mentality of the government elite, and that's really what they're focusing
[28:22.740 --> 28:28.020]  on in this movie. They're trying to set up the idea that if you're part of the military,
[28:28.020 --> 28:32.780]  if you're part of the government, you're going to be taken care of. Everybody else is either
[28:32.780 --> 28:39.060]  helpless or they're kind of a rabid problem, a rabid disease, a virus. That's something
[28:39.060 --> 28:45.260]  that we've seen, a meme that we've seen for a long time from people with the Gaia group.
[28:45.260 --> 28:52.660]  They basically posited this idea that Gaia is the spirit of the earth and a living organism.
[28:52.660 --> 28:57.980]  And as a living organism, humans are basically a destructive virus that at best needs to
[28:57.980 --> 29:03.200]  be contained, but it would be optimal if we could just wipe it out. And I have to say,
[29:03.200 --> 29:08.980]  that was really the feeling I got watching that movie last night, World War Z. But what
[29:08.980 --> 29:14.340]  comes from that kind of a mentality, a kind of us versus them, a kind of attitude that
[29:14.340 --> 29:20.300]  if you do something and you're part of the insider group, you're part of the official
[29:20.300 --> 29:24.700]  people with uniforms, you don't ever get called into question for anything you do. And we're
[29:24.700 --> 29:29.980]  going to be talking to somebody right after the break whose daughter, 11 year old daughter,
[29:29.980 --> 29:35.340]  was tasered by police. How about that? The police couldn't handle 11 year old girl. They
[29:35.340 --> 29:39.100]  had to taser her. We're going to be talking to him right after the break. So stay tuned.
[29:39.100 --> 29:40.100]  You won't want to miss this.
[29:40.100 --> 30:01.060]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:14.660 --> 33:30.180]  it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight filling in for
[33:30.180 --> 33:37.820]  Alex and we have a very, very disturbing story coming up here about a young girl who is tasered
[33:37.820 --> 33:42.060]  by the police. Now I don't know if you've seen the recent previews for the movie that's
[33:42.060 --> 33:47.180]  coming out in August, Elysium, but the beginning of that trailer tape is a very disturbing
[33:47.180 --> 33:52.120]  scene which is becoming more and more like the operating principle for our police in
[33:52.120 --> 33:59.620]  this country. In that scene, the star of the film, Matt Damon, is asked by a robotic cop
[33:59.620 --> 34:03.940]  something about what he's got in his bag or some kind of a question and he kind of gives
[34:03.940 --> 34:11.000]  a little bit of a comedic, sarcastic answer and the robot police just beat him to a pulp
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.340]  basically and that's what we're starting to see right now in the United States because
[34:16.340 --> 34:21.900]  what's happening is no matter what the police do, they're simply given some kind of an administrative
[34:21.900 --> 34:26.680]  leave, maybe an unpaid or maybe it's a paid leave where they're taken off of their duty,
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.180]  they get a vacation, they actually get rewarded in many cases, if you want to look at it,
[34:30.180 --> 34:35.860]  they get a few days off and get an unpaid leave or even if in some cases a paid leave
[34:35.860 --> 34:40.420]  while this is being investigated and then they're reinstated. Even in situations where
[34:40.420 --> 34:46.060]  the police chief wants to get rid of the officer because of the brutality, he is opposed by
[34:46.060 --> 34:52.740]  the unions and the officer is kept on. We've got a case coming out of Oregon that was written
[34:52.740 --> 34:57.760]  up by Don Salazar yesterday. Oregon State Police taser autistic child found wandering
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.900]  naked. He says in this article, when police found a confused and naked 11-year-old girl
[35:02.900 --> 35:07.260]  wandering a stretch of highway along the I-5 corridor in Oregon, they didn't exactly offer
[35:07.260 --> 35:11.180]  her a ride home. Instead, the responding officer determined the best course of action would
[35:11.180 --> 35:16.940]  be to taser her. Now what was happening was a cab driver, Adam Bednar, came across this
[35:16.940 --> 35:21.660]  young girl walking down the highway confused. She was nude and threw him a smile indicating
[35:21.660 --> 35:25.060]  she wasn't fully aware of where she was or what she was doing. He said he thought she
[35:25.060 --> 35:29.900]  was drugged in some way, thought she might be on bath salts or meth or something like
[35:29.900 --> 35:35.060]  that. So he drove alongside her while he called the police. The trooper that arrived called
[35:35.060 --> 35:42.100]  for her to stop and when she didn't obey the cop, he threatened to taser and he did. Now
[35:42.100 --> 35:46.460]  we have a report from a local news station here that let's go ahead and throw to that
[35:46.460 --> 35:51.900]  report and see what they actually talked to some witnesses there that report. The young
[35:51.900 --> 35:57.420]  woman seen walking confused and naked right here near a mile post 18 on I-5 is a juvenile
[35:57.420 --> 36:02.500]  and because of that state police aren't releasing her name or the exact details around her condition.
[36:02.500 --> 36:09.540]  One eyewitness says the situation was like nothing he had ever seen. It was a sight Adam
[36:09.540 --> 36:14.020]  Bednar says he wishes he could forget. I don't know how to describe it really. It was just
[36:14.020 --> 36:18.380]  shocking that was all. You know I couldn't believe that it was happening. OSP officials
[36:18.380 --> 36:23.380]  describe a young girl unresponsive and confused wandering naked along the highway. It was
[36:23.380 --> 36:27.660]  Adam that first found her there. I stopped the car in the middle of the freeway. I backed
[36:27.660 --> 36:36.180]  up and she kind of looked in my window. She kind of laughed and kept on walking. Adam
[36:36.180 --> 36:40.180]  drove alongside her while he called police. He says the trooper who arrived called for
[36:40.180 --> 36:45.500]  her to stop and threatened twice to tase her. After giving no response, two little red dots
[36:45.500 --> 36:51.780]  appeared on her back then metal barbs. She seized up and she just fell face first on
[36:51.780 --> 36:57.580]  the ground. Just face first on the ground. OSP officials say it was necessary to prevent
[36:57.580 --> 37:02.220]  her from wandering further into the road and putting herself in danger. Adam who helps
[37:02.220 --> 37:06.860]  troopers apprehend the girl on the hood of his car says he isn't so sure. She wasn't
[37:06.860 --> 37:11.800]  going off the road. She was set on walking down the freeway and I think that had she
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.600]  waited for backup they probably could have got her without the taser. As for the reasons
[37:15.600 --> 37:20.780]  for her behavior state police say she likely has autism. Adam says whatever it was it was
[37:20.780 --> 37:25.380]  baffling. I thought she was drunk. I thought she was on you know maybe bath salts, too
[37:25.380 --> 37:30.540]  much meth, something. What is certain is that the young girl was not the victim of a crime
[37:30.540 --> 37:35.060]  and she is reportedly safe with her family but Adam says he isn't about to forget this
[37:35.060 --> 37:41.740]  case anytime soon. Wow the most the craziest experience of my life. State police say the
[37:41.740 --> 37:45.340]  young woman in this case won't be charged with any crimes because she wasn't aware of
[37:45.340 --> 37:49.860]  her surroundings. They say the use of force is done at an officer's discretion but they
[37:49.860 --> 37:54.500]  will be reviewing it to make sure it meets their policies. In Ashland, Justin Bork News
[37:54.500 --> 38:02.880]  Watch 12. That's just amazing. I have an 11-year-old daughter and don't tell me that a cop couldn't
[38:02.880 --> 38:09.200]  control an 11-year-old girl without tasering her. That is the most cowardly disgusting
[38:09.200 --> 38:15.820]  thing I've ever heard that someone would do that to an 11-year-old girl. Don't they have
[38:15.820 --> 38:21.820]  any capability of handling these situations? I mean the whole idea of having a taser is
[38:21.820 --> 38:27.220]  that they're not exposing themselves to undue risk. Do they really feel like that 11-year-old
[38:27.220 --> 38:32.080]  girl presents a threat to the officer that he needs to use that? The fact that it's non-lethal
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.380]  force doesn't really mean anything. We've had people die from being tasered. You have
[38:36.380 --> 38:41.220]  people seriously injured from being tasered. As he said, she fell face forward when he
[38:41.220 --> 38:48.220]  tasered her. I just don't understand how the government allows police officers to get away
[38:48.220 --> 38:53.700]  with this time and time again and when they do, it just makes them worse the next time.
[38:53.700 --> 38:59.380]  We've got on the phone here the father of the young girl who was tasered and we want
[38:59.380 --> 39:04.940]  to ask him a few questions and get his comments on that. As a father, I'm absolutely outraged
[39:04.940 --> 39:10.700]  about that. Hello, are you there? Yeah, I'm right here. I don't want to use your name
[39:10.700 --> 39:15.820]  without any permission. Well, you wanted to put your name up there, but that's fine. Tell
[39:15.820 --> 39:22.900]  us a little bit about this from your perspective. Well, basically, we got a call a little before
[39:22.900 --> 39:30.900]  six in the morning from the Oregon State Police that they had my daughter. We have our house
[39:30.900 --> 39:36.060]  very well secured, but she's clever. Even though she doesn't talk, she's very clever,
[39:36.060 --> 39:44.220]  very perceptive, and she managed to unscrew the security mechanism we had on the window.
[39:44.220 --> 39:49.980]  They call them runners. There's a lot of autistic children that have this characteristic. Once
[39:49.980 --> 39:57.540]  they get out, they just run in whatever direction they want to go. She loves cars and where
[39:57.540 --> 40:02.060]  are the most cars? On the freeway. She doesn't understand the danger. She doesn't understand
[40:02.060 --> 40:09.900]  any of that. But she got out and we got a call at six in the morning, said they had
[40:09.900 --> 40:16.100]  my daughter. And I was grateful that they brought her back safe. Of course, as a parent,
[40:16.100 --> 40:23.660]  you've got to be grateful for that, that they bring your daughter back safe. But later developments,
[40:23.660 --> 40:29.100]  I hear that they had to taser her in order to bring her in. And it would seem that a
[40:29.100 --> 40:37.900]  naked handicapped female wandering down the freeway tasers would not be necessary in order
[40:37.900 --> 40:42.740]  to apprehend a child. I mean, tasers are dangerous. They can cause fatalities.
[40:42.740 --> 40:49.060]  Absolutely. Do you find your daughter physically threatening or intimidating when you are around
[40:49.060 --> 40:54.220]  her or other people find her very large and scary that you feel like the police would
[40:54.220 --> 40:56.940]  be justified in terms of tasering her?
[40:56.940 --> 41:02.460]  Not at all. I mean, she is physically fit, but she certainly is not threatening. She's
[41:02.460 --> 41:06.580]  very gentle. She giggles. I'm sure when she was wandering down the freeway, she thought
[41:06.580 --> 41:10.300]  this was the greatest thing in the world. She was probably happy just cruising down
[41:10.300 --> 41:14.060]  the freeway. I mean, I know how she is when she gets out. She just thinks it's the greatest
[41:14.060 --> 41:19.700]  thing. She's happy. And the police have this way of always escalating the situation. They
[41:19.700 --> 41:25.760]  don't try to bring the situation down and apprehend a suspect in a diplomatic manner.
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.460]  They do it by escalating the situation.
[41:29.460 --> 41:34.500]  Well, they pull up and they start making demands. First thing they do is say, do this, do that.
[41:34.500 --> 41:38.420]  If you don't do that, then I'm going to tase you if you don't do what I say. And then they
[41:38.420 --> 41:43.020]  go ahead and tase people. They don't try to assess the situation. They don't try, as you
[41:43.020 --> 41:46.980]  said, to deescalate the situation or really even try to ascertain what's going on. We
[41:46.980 --> 41:51.600]  had a situation here in Austin where there was a car accident and the fellow that was
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.380]  involved in the car accident, I believe it was diabetes, but it was some kind of physical
[41:55.380 --> 42:01.740]  condition where he was essentially unable to talk. And the cop came up and started telling
[42:01.740 --> 42:05.380]  him to get out of the car and do this or that. And the guy just sat there, wouldn't talk
[42:05.380 --> 42:10.660]  to the car to the cop. And he started to threaten him with a taser and then eventually tasered
[42:10.660 --> 42:14.780]  this guy who was physically unable to respond to him.
[42:14.780 --> 42:19.820]  So the question is at this point, I guess, have you heard anything from the police department
[42:19.820 --> 42:25.540]  other than it's up to the officer's discretion as to how and when he uses force?
[42:25.540 --> 42:33.260]  Well, it's just the basic generic statements that they had to taser her to save her life
[42:33.260 --> 42:37.860]  from running into traffic. But I have a tip quoting from the witness, the taxi driver,
[42:37.860 --> 42:41.940]  that said that was absolutely not the case, that the police were lying, in fact, that
[42:41.940 --> 42:46.700]  she was not in any danger. They had her cornered. The traffic was completely stopped. There
[42:46.700 --> 42:53.500]  was no need to taser whatsoever. And I can play that audio. I did interview the guy this
[42:53.500 --> 42:54.500]  morning.
[42:54.500 --> 42:58.260]  Yeah, I'd like to hear that. Let's play that. That's audio that you interviewed the taxi
[42:58.260 --> 43:00.100]  driver who was the eyewitness to this?
[43:00.100 --> 43:01.100]  Yeah, Adam.
[43:01.100 --> 43:02.100]  Okay.
[43:02.100 --> 43:03.100]  You ready?
[43:03.100 --> 43:04.100]  Yeah, go ahead.
[43:04.100 --> 43:26.100]  We talked for a good 45 minutes and he detailed the whole situation. They had traffic stopped.
[43:26.100 --> 43:31.860]  There was no danger that she was in. There was no danger. The freeway traffic was completely
[43:31.860 --> 43:36.340]  stopped. And obviously, my daughter, she's not an aggressive type. She doesn't attack
[43:36.340 --> 43:39.940]  people. She was just intent on cruising down the road and doing her thing. That's kind
[43:39.940 --> 43:46.060]  of how these autistic kids do their thing. They put their sight on a direction and they
[43:46.060 --> 43:47.060]  go.
[43:47.060 --> 43:51.180]  Right. Well, I guess the question, though, is that they are using these tasers almost
[43:51.180 --> 43:56.380]  like whips. Do what I say or I'm going to electronically whip you. What do you think
[43:56.380 --> 43:59.740]  is the answer to this as a parent? What would you like to see happen?
[43:59.740 --> 44:04.940]  Well, in this circumstance, what I would like to have seen happen is the officer or whoever
[44:04.940 --> 44:08.820]  to walk up, grab her by the head and say, come on, sweetie, get in the car. She's very
[44:08.820 --> 44:13.240]  cooperative in that respect. She loves cars. I mean, she hops in strangers cars just out
[44:13.240 --> 44:18.660]  of nowhere if someone is nice to her. I mean, she's obsessed with cars and going places.
[44:18.660 --> 44:25.320]  So she sees the freeway as a place to go places. I mean, she doesn't understand these things
[44:25.320 --> 44:26.320]  at all.
[44:26.320 --> 44:27.320]  Absolutely.
[44:27.320 --> 44:33.660]  It would be perfectly easy to determine that the situation is a handicapped job to walk
[44:33.660 --> 44:37.940]  up, grab her by the hand, say, come on, sweetie, let's get in the car. And you'd think it was
[44:37.940 --> 44:41.380]  actually a female officer. It was not a male officer. It was a female officer.
[44:41.380 --> 44:46.500]  Well, I would think even a female officer wouldn't be physically afraid of a 11 year
[44:46.500 --> 44:49.860]  old girl that's not acting aggressively. As you said, she's just walking along the side
[44:49.860 --> 44:50.860]  of the highway.
[44:50.860 --> 44:54.420]  Well, what's there to be afraid of if you're an armed, trained officer?
[44:54.420 --> 45:00.300]  Exactly. Exactly. No traffic coming. Here's a naked little girl. What's there to be afraid
[45:00.300 --> 45:06.620]  of? I mean, either she's, I mean, they have to apprehend a defensive and offensive male
[45:06.620 --> 45:11.820]  and female subjects all the time that might be armed and might do this. It seems obvious
[45:11.820 --> 45:20.500]  that with a naked child, it would be pretty easy to apprehend and get the child to a safe
[45:20.500 --> 45:21.500]  area without-
[45:21.500 --> 45:25.380]  You can't make the case that maybe she's got some kind of concealed weapon. You know, even
[45:25.380 --> 45:29.620]  though we're talking about an 11 year old child, I mean, the typical excuses that these
[45:29.620 --> 45:32.900]  people have are, well, I thought they had a weapon or they pulled a weapon. You can
[45:32.900 --> 45:38.140]  see that the child's got nothing at all. Like you said, totally naked, empty handed, walking
[45:38.140 --> 45:43.320]  alongside the road, an 11 year old girl, and it's necessary to just taser her because she's
[45:43.320 --> 45:47.180]  not following the orders of her Lords and Masters in uniform.
[45:47.180 --> 45:51.680]  Right. And she wasn't pursuing the officer. She was still doing a thing, wandering down
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.820]  the freeway. They had traffic completely stopped by the witness account and they shot her in
[45:56.820 --> 46:02.580]  the back, not in the front. She wasn't approaching them. She wasn't weaving into traffic or anything.
[46:02.580 --> 46:08.740]  They had traffic completely stopped. So they use the taser now as a first means of apprehending
[46:08.740 --> 46:15.140]  suspects. It's supposed to be basically a barrier between having to shoot or use lethal
[46:15.140 --> 46:16.140]  force.
[46:16.140 --> 46:17.140]  That's right.
[46:17.140 --> 46:19.100]  That's not the way of apprehending anybody.
[46:19.100 --> 46:23.260]  It's become so common. We get these stories all the time because it's a story that we're
[46:23.260 --> 46:27.060]  concerned about here at Infowars. We're concerned about civil liberties. We're concerned about
[46:27.060 --> 46:31.540]  an out of control government. So people send us these stories all the time. We see so much
[46:31.540 --> 46:37.540]  of this and there's no concern about the use of tasers. It's just random procedure. And
[46:37.540 --> 46:42.120]  as you said, it's become the first thing they do. They don't even stop and think about it.
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.100]  I think what's needed at the local level is we've got to have some politicians who are
[46:46.100 --> 46:51.260]  going to say every time they do this, it's going to be treated as if it was a shooting.
[46:51.260 --> 46:54.340]  There's going to be an investigation. And I think there needs to be an investigation
[46:54.340 --> 46:59.820]  when the police use force, even non-lethal force, there needs to be an investigation
[46:59.820 --> 47:03.020]  as to whether or not that force is warranted or not.
[47:03.020 --> 47:07.820]  And I think that investigation needs to be done by a group of citizens, not internally,
[47:07.820 --> 47:12.700]  not having the foxes guarding the chicken house, so to speak. They're not going to police
[47:12.700 --> 47:16.660]  themselves, basically. We have to know who's going to police the police, who's going to
[47:16.660 --> 47:21.700]  watch the watchers. That's always the question in a society that wants to remain free. And
[47:21.700 --> 47:25.420]  if we don't have the answer to that question, we're not going to remain free.
[47:25.420 --> 47:31.140]  Well, also you have to kind of recognize that in order to apprehend a suspect, you have
[47:31.140 --> 47:36.420]  to assault them. You have to commit a crime in order to apprehend somebody. I mean, that's
[47:36.420 --> 47:41.580]  an assault, blatant assault on a child in order to apprehend them. If anybody did that
[47:41.580 --> 47:46.020]  in a different situation, they would be charged with assault. So the government has this means
[47:46.020 --> 47:50.260]  of creating legislation in order to monopolize that they're the only ones that can get away
[47:50.260 --> 47:54.660]  with assaulting people. The police can get away with tasing, shooting, and beating people
[47:54.660 --> 47:58.500]  up in order to apprehend them. And a lot of them aren't even guilty of a crime. They're
[47:58.500 --> 48:00.680]  suspected of one.
[48:00.680 --> 48:07.140]  So government has this nature of creating legislation so they're the only ones that
[48:07.140 --> 48:12.900]  can get away with committing the acts of assault or whatever. And then it's perfectly acceptable
[48:12.900 --> 48:14.500]  for the government to do it.
[48:14.500 --> 48:18.260]  And it's very instructive too. When we look at the gun control debate, what they're talking
[48:18.260 --> 48:22.660]  about is essentially giving the government a monopoly on the use of force. And as you're
[48:22.660 --> 48:27.380]  just talking about, when they have that kind of monopoly, like in a situation where they
[48:27.380 --> 48:31.420]  walk up and there's an unarmed 11 year old girl, how do they respond? And this is not
[48:31.420 --> 48:35.940]  an isolated case. This is a pattern of behavior that we see over and over again. If you want
[48:35.940 --> 48:39.580]  to know what's going to happen when only the police have guns, when only the criminals
[48:39.580 --> 48:44.060]  have guns, then take a look at Mexico, take a look at Chicago.
[48:44.060 --> 48:47.620]  These are not the kind of people that we can trust with a monopoly on force. There has
[48:47.620 --> 48:53.140]  to be some oversight and there has to be essentially a deterrent knowing that other people have
[48:53.140 --> 48:58.060]  arms I think. But it's something that's very disturbing to see that they can do whatever
[48:58.060 --> 49:02.540]  they please. There's never any accountability. There's never any guidelines for the use of
[49:02.540 --> 49:06.540]  tasers. I don't know of any guidelines for the use of tasers. It always seems to be at
[49:06.540 --> 49:09.940]  the discretion of the police force in every location I've looked at.
[49:09.940 --> 49:15.100]  Well, journalism, I mean, is supposed to be kind of the countermeasure towards government
[49:15.100 --> 49:19.660]  getting away with whatever they want. But what happens is journalism and the network
[49:19.660 --> 49:26.180]  media getting kind of, forget the term, but an incestuous relationship to where the media
[49:26.180 --> 49:30.140]  needs the government and the government needs the media. The media isn't serving us necessarily.
[49:30.140 --> 49:35.660]  They're serving themselves. Oh, absolutely. The media has been consolidated
[49:35.660 --> 49:41.100]  down to about five big companies. And they basically, whether you're talking about local
[49:41.100 --> 49:46.380]  issues or whether you're talking about big national issues of civil liberties, they take
[49:46.380 --> 49:50.460]  the government's side. They're the government's mouthpiece. They make the excuses for the
[49:50.460 --> 49:54.900]  government. Right. And so it becomes a single kind of organism
[49:54.900 --> 50:00.460]  if you will, that really doesn't have our interest in mind as far as citizenry. They
[50:00.460 --> 50:04.780]  have their own interest in mind. And the media needs the government and the government needs
[50:04.780 --> 50:10.860]  the media. It becomes one kind of thing. And it certainly doesn't have the citizenry's
[50:10.860 --> 50:15.780]  interest in mind. And what confines the government? The constitution. So wouldn't the government
[50:15.780 --> 50:21.300]  have the most interest in dismantling what confines it? I mean, they've been systematically
[50:21.300 --> 50:26.700]  doing it over the years, case by case and incident by incident. They'll use whatever
[50:26.700 --> 50:33.860]  they can to dismantle various rights systematically over the years. So basically that's exactly
[50:33.860 --> 50:39.320]  what whistleblower Drake said, NSA whistleblower Drake said. He said after 9-11, the government
[50:39.320 --> 50:43.500]  took off the chains of the constitution. We had Patrick Henry say, bind them down with
[50:43.500 --> 50:46.820]  the chains of the constitution. Well, they've cut those chains now and they're pretty much
[50:46.820 --> 50:50.980]  doing anything that they want to. Well, thank you so much for coming forward and speaking
[50:50.980 --> 50:55.220]  out about this. I'm very sorry that happened to your daughter. Hopefully some good will

[53:12.280 --> 53:15.700]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing

[54:19.740 --> 54:23.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex. We were
[54:23.380 --> 54:27.940]  just talking in the last break to a father whose 11-year-old daughter was tasered by
[54:27.940 --> 54:33.020]  the police. Rather than talk to her, rather than try to ascertain why she was walking
[54:33.020 --> 54:37.920]  alongside the road without any clothes, calmly walking alongside the road according to the
[54:37.920 --> 54:42.900]  eyewitness cab driver who called the police, they just tasered her. She didn't obey their
[54:42.900 --> 54:46.660]  orders, they just tasered her. They could see that she didn't have any weapons because
[54:46.660 --> 54:50.340]  she wasn't wearing any clothes, she's autistic. That's why she was out at that time. They
[54:50.340 --> 54:55.700]  didn't try to ascertain that. And the question is, what are we going to do to try to control
[54:55.700 --> 55:03.100]  government at the local level? And it's getting worse. The 2014 National Defense Authorization
[55:03.100 --> 55:08.340]  Act is now being constructed and it's getting worse every year with this. If you remember
[55:08.340 --> 55:14.460]  last year, I think the first one that came out was in 2012 and remember Barack Obama
[55:14.460 --> 55:18.180]  was not going to sign that and he said he didn't need it and then at the last minute
[55:18.180 --> 55:21.380]  on a New Year's Eve, he signed it and then said, don't worry, I'm not going to enforce
[55:21.380 --> 55:26.380]  it. Then when it came up for reauthorization, they said that they were going to put some
[55:26.380 --> 55:33.540]  protections in it and we had Dianne Feinstein come in and put a fig leaf amendment in it
[55:33.540 --> 55:38.580]  that Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers and others argued really wasn't going to do anything
[55:38.580 --> 55:44.620]  but it gave cover to senators who might have to oppose it because of their commitments
[55:44.620 --> 55:50.860]  to civil liberties. It actually got unanimous support in the Senate and never got to be
[55:50.860 --> 55:55.540]  tested because when it went to the joint committee to be reconciled between the Senate and the
[55:55.540 --> 56:01.940]  House, McCain and the House members just arbitrarily threw that out and so it stood just as it
[56:01.940 --> 56:07.820]  was the year before. Well, now it's coming around again for 2014 and it's actually going
[56:07.820 --> 56:11.340]  to get worse. What they're doing is, and we talked about this at the beginning, just like
[56:11.340 --> 56:16.900]  with the immigration bill, they do things that violate the law or they don't enforce
[56:16.900 --> 56:22.780]  the law and then what they come in and do later is they pass a law that justifies what
[56:22.780 --> 56:27.680]  they've been doing all along and that's what we're seeing happening with the NDAA Act.
[56:27.680 --> 56:31.620]  We know that for a long time the government has been tapping people's phone lines. We
[56:31.620 --> 56:35.580]  know that they've been storing data. They've been mining the data. This is starting to
[56:35.580 --> 56:40.240]  come out now just the tip of it, just the tip of it with Ed Snowden's releases. They're
[56:40.240 --> 56:43.900]  still talking about how, don't worry, it's only the metadata. Well, that's not what we're
[56:43.900 --> 56:48.300]  hearing from NSA whistleblowers. They're telling us it's everything and they're telling us
[56:48.300 --> 56:54.220]  that it's been stored. As a matter of fact, there's an interview with one of the original
[56:54.220 --> 57:00.880]  NSA whistleblowers on the boilingfrogs.com website and that's Cebel Edmonds' site. She
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.780]  has been one of the premier whistleblowers. Daniel Ellsberg called her one of the most
[57:05.780 --> 57:09.700]  important whistleblowers ever, said she was more important than the revelations that he
[57:09.700 --> 57:17.300]  had about the Pentagon Papers. Cebel Edmonds was an FBI translator and she had information
[57:17.300 --> 57:27.460]  that the FBI was actually working with Al-Qaeda leading up to 9-11 and they came after her
[57:27.460 --> 57:33.740]  pretty hard. But she's got a site here. She talks to another NSA whistleblower, Russ Tice,
[57:33.740 --> 57:37.740]  and this is something you need to go by and take a look at on their website. In this video,
[57:37.740 --> 57:43.580]  Mr. Tice explains in detail how the NSA targets, sucks in, stores, analyzes, and illegally
[57:43.580 --> 57:48.940]  obtained content from the masses of the United States. And he maintains that the new data
[57:48.940 --> 57:54.940]  center that's being built in Utah, the NSA's Utah facility, is already operating and online.
[57:54.940 --> 57:58.720]  We've been told that it's not going to come online and start operating until sometime
[57:58.720 --> 58:05.780]  in September. He says it's already online. He reveals that the NSA is a deep state that
[58:05.780 --> 58:10.900]  targets and wiretaps US political candidates for their own purpose. And that's a very interesting
[58:10.900 --> 58:16.740]  elevation because if they can come after political candidates, and he mentions a Supreme Court
[58:16.740 --> 58:22.540]  judge that is now sitting, he doesn't mention by name, if they can blackmail and investigate
[58:22.540 --> 58:39.580]  judges and CIA directors, they can come after you as well. We'll be right back. Stay tuned.

[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:39.620]  Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. Alex is not here. I'm David Knight,
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.380]  filling in for him, and we're going to be joined in just a few minutes by Dr. William
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.740]  Pepper, a very well-known human rights international lawyer. And while we're on this topic of
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:56.320]  what's legal and what's not, as we were talking about just before the hour, the new NDAA 2014
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:03.380]  is coming up. And in an article from Truthout.org, they point out that two sections, section
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.580]  206 of the Patriot Act that permitted government to obtain secret court orders allowing roving
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:12.300]  wiretaps without requiring identification of the person, organization, or facility to
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:18.580]  be surveyed, and section 215 of the Patriot Act authorizing government to access and obtain
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:25.460]  any tangible thing that is relevant to a terrorist investigation. Those were things that joined
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:31.900]  the FISA Act that was passed all the way back in 1978. Now, FISA has come into the news
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:38.660]  quite a bit with the revelations from Ed Snowden. And it was the core thing behind the resignation
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:44.740]  of several whistleblowers right after September 11th. Whistleblowers William Binney, Drake,
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:52.700]  and Wiebe all testified that they tried to get the NSA to not do what it did after September
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:59.500]  11th, and that is use a dragnet to get domestic information. Prior to that, since 1978, the
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:06.020]  NSA had been looking at foreign information. And these guys were technical personnel who
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:11.540]  had developed a system they called ThinThread. And with ThinThread, they would eliminate
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:17.540]  domestic information. But the US government in the aftermath of 9-11 went with a different
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:23.060]  program called Trailblazer. And they criticized it not only for its blatant violation of the
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.580]  Constitution, blatant violation and extension of the powers that they had been given with
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.100]  FISA, the unlawful extension of those powers. But they also pointed out that it wasn't even
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:37.020]  effective. Just like the TSA is not effective as a security organization at the airport,
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.020]  this was not effective in terms of trying to find people who really were the needles
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:46.220]  in the haystack of this data, the people who really were bad actors. It was absolutely
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.180]  ineffective in that, but it was a very expensive program. It transferred a lot of money to
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:56.060]  the companies that were well connected within the military industrial complex. And it's
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.220]  their accusation that that's the reason they went with it. These people tried to reform
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.220]  this internally. They followed all the internal procedures going to the inspector general,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:11.340]  going to the Department of Justice, but they came after them personally, indicted all of
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.340]  them.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:18.540]  Eventually, let three of the four people go. They came after Drake and tried to pin him
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:23.860]  down because of a bogus charge that he had mishandled documents. They didn't accuse him
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:29.220]  of transmitting any state secrets. And it turned out that the documents they had listed,
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:34.380]  many of them were not classified. Some of them had been retroactively classified after
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.620]  they found them in his residence. And they are now very outspoken critics. And as I mentioned
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:46.540]  just before the break, there is a Russ Tice, who is also a critic of the NSA, a former
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:53.660]  NSA whistleblower. And in an interview on bowlingfrogs.com, that's C. Bell Edmonds,
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:59.500]  a FBI whistleblower about 9-11. This is the money quote from that interview. He said,
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.540]  here's the big one. This was the summer of 2004. One of the papers that I held in my
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.940]  hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with a 40 something year old wannabe senator
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.460]  for Illinois, he said. You wouldn't happen to know where that guy lives right now, would
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:17.420]  you? Well, it's a big White House in Washington DC. They basically went after Barack Obama.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.300]  So this is something that's been going on for a long time. And we don't excuse this
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:27.100]  by saying that it started with Bush. Because Obama, as the subject of these kind of illegal
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:31.660]  investigations has now turned around and made it even worse and made it even more public.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.360]  And that's the real danger. Stay tuned right after the break. We're going to be talking
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.200]  to Dr. William Pepper. And we're going to ask him what he thinks about the surveillance
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.800]  state and what he thinks about what this country is turning into as far as ignoring human rights
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:05:00.900]  and the Constitution. Stay tuned. We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:05.620]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.660]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:17.820]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:23.500]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:29.300]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:34.180]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:40.640]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit Infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and

[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:28.780]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:33.220]  loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take total control
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:37.140]  of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:42.140]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:51.740]  but demand a war. State of mind because there's a war on for your mind. Get your copy of State

[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:20.900]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:30.900]  Alex Jones. Welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex today.
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:35.100]  We have a very important and interesting guest that's going to be coming on in just a minute
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:42.260]  or so it's Dr. William Pepper. Dr. Pepper is a human rights law advocate he is a barrister
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:46.000]  from the United Kingdom admitted to the bar in numerous jurisdictions throughout the United
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.700]  States. Now he was involved in the televised trial of James Earl Ray. It was a mock trial
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:57.340]  to attempt to get Ray the trial that he never had and he's also been involved in a recent
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:03.860]  trial trying to get a retrial for Sirhan Sirhan filing motions to get a retrial based on new
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.040]  evidence that is surfaced as recently as within the last 10 years. There's been a lot of evidence
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.140]  that's surfaced about that so we're going to talk to him about that as well as cases
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.180]  that are breaking. Now one thing I want to get his opinion on and this is a breaking
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:23.980]  piece of news the judges who preside over America's secret court this is out of Reuters
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:29.660]  that says 12 of the 14 judges who have served this year on the most secret court in America
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:35.780]  are Republicans half are former prosecutors. What we're seeing here with the FISA court
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:41.780]  we're told not to worry about all these releases of NSA snooping because it's all been authorized
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:47.180]  by these judges. Well it turns out that they fly them in for a short period of time they're
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:52.660]  actually working on as regular judges and their jurisdiction they fly them in from time
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:58.100]  to time they do a cursory review of this stuff and just say go ahead and do it. There's not
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:05.260]  any sense of a reasonable cause when you give the government permission to look at the phone
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:09.420]  information for millions of American customers. Don't tell me that they did any kind of an
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.460]  investigation about that. So we're going back to is where we're kind of overthrowing the
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:19.860]  rule of law and the overthrow of things like star chambers. We're going back to things
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:26.180]  that are we hope we'd left behind in the dark ages and so I'd like to get Dr. Pepper's comment
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:32.020]  about that. Dr. Pepper thank you for joining us today. It's good to be with you. What do
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.220]  you think about that? What do you think of the secret courts that we're told that we
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:41.500]  don't have anything to worry about because all these FISA releases are being overseen
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:46.860]  by a judge and so in a secret court so they've okayed that and we're not allowed to see those
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.700]  decisions what the basis of that was but we should be reassured that we have judges even
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.940]  though they're secret looking over this stuff. What do you think about that? Well I think
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:02.860]  the basis of any democracy is accountability and ultimately accountability to the people
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:09.060]  and one of the problems with secrecy of any kind including the deliberations that go before
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:19.700]  the FISA courts is that the people are not given the opportunity to understand the underlying
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:27.220]  basis and reason for as you did say the decisions that are being made. When you have a situation
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:35.580]  as we did have in America and in my view this is not the country I grew up in you had a
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:43.340]  separation of powers that meant something where there was a crossover in terms of checks
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:50.020]  and balances and we're moving further and further away from that and I think you're
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:56.540]  quite right into a more secretive society and the FISA courts which have been around
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:04.380]  for some time now are only one example of the movement towards secrecy and the unaccountability
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:11.140]  of the government particularly the executive and if you had a congress that was willing
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:18.020]  to look at the actions of the executive and in here you have to understand the executive
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:24.180]  acts also by executive order and those executive orders so many people in the United States
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:34.380]  don't even know anything about and yet the last two presidents have exhibited a great
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:41.420]  tendency to rule by executive order so we don't have congressional accountability despite
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:47.020]  a lot of the bluff and the bluster that goes on over nothing really and major issues are
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:54.740]  just ignored so I think people should be aware and I think people should be concerned and
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:59.540]  look to trying to reestablish the rule of law in an accountable way.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.220]  What do you think about the parallels to the Nixon impeachment when we look at what Obama
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:09.820]  is not to me it's amazing the parallels the nature of what he was accused of basically
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.980]  using the IRS against enemies wire tapping people we see the same things happening with
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.940]  the Obama administration but the magnitude and the extent of it are so much greater and
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:24.740]  yet there's absolutely no talk about impeachment from either party.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:32.220]  Well I mean this guy is in league with the ruling forces of the society and they control
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:39.020]  they dominate the Congress and they control the whole process of impeachment.
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.340]  And that's exactly what you were saying in the beginning you said that this is not the
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:47.700]  country that you grew up in because when Nixon was around at least there was some checks
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.880]  and balances going on from one branch to the other.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.420]  The Congress would actually stand up and say something about some of these illegal actions
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:59.220]  whereas today they just are complicit and go along with it.
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:05.020]  Well you don't have any devotion to the Constitution really with few exceptions but I'm going to
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:10.340]  say there are some exceptions but with few exceptions the Constitution seems to be capable
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:19.940]  of being ameliorated pushed aside all in the name of this new war this war on terror and
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:27.180]  now they're moving this the fear of terrorism very clearly into the domestic side of things
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:32.980]  you know foreign terrorists were the major concern after 9-11 well we've crossed that
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:40.320]  bridge and we're now involved with concern about domestic terrorism and I think the number
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:48.020]  of war games that the Pentagon has slated and they're available on the Pentagon's website
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:58.340]  are indicative of the fact that they are now gearing up for massive crackdowns and I think
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:03.540]  it's going to ultimately lead to a suppression of all dissent I think that's where it's heading.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:08.340]  We've talked over and over again on this show about how they have set up war games as you
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.900]  mention it in various cities where they go in and they have joint exercises between the
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.260]  military and the police and it's being done on an increasing basis increasingly frequent
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:21.920]  basis part of it is getting people accustomed to that but the other part of it is as they
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.100]  said they'd like to train in a scenario that they're going to be engaged in so when you
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:30.720]  see them in American cities working with the police you can understand that they're not
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.140]  training for the invasion of Syria because they don't think that they're going to get
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:41.140]  the cooperation of the police in Syria they're training for domestic oppression that's what
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.860]  they're training in with these different exercises don't you believe that?
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:48.060]  Well they've been at this for a long time the militarization of the police has been
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:56.100]  going on for well over 35 years it's been gradual they've been infiltrated by intelligence
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:02.820]  agencies and the defense department and I think it's virtually complete at this point
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:09.420]  the Americans it's happening right under their noses unfortunately they don't know and maybe
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:14.420]  don't want to know there's a whole psychological mindset that I think you have to be very conscious
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:23.660]  of and aware of it it's very easy for citizens in a republic like this to go into a situation
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:29.700]  of denial where they really they just don't want to know and that's that is what's most
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:37.220]  frightening to me because the only two roads to power and change are money in numbers since
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:42.700]  we know who controls the money the numbers are the only route available and if you don't
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:54.620]  have a mobilized population as the Occupy movement in its infancy attempted to establish
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.020]  we're in deep trouble here.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:00.540]  Yeah absolutely one of the things I'd like to talk to you about is the Sirhan Sirhan
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:05.020]  case because that is something that just came up recently and you're trying to get a new
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:10.860]  trial for Sirhan Sirhan based on evidence there's a fascinating case that's there but
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.620]  I guess part of it that fascinates me is the fact and and I really respect what you've
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:21.380]  done because when you stand up against something that is the narrative of the mainstream media
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:27.180]  like the case of Sirhan Sirhan you get called conspiracy theorists you get ridiculed and
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:32.900]  yet it's not an open and shut case tell us a little bit about that.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:41.620]  Well I and my colleague Laurie Dusick agreed to take on the Sirhan habeas corpus petition
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:51.540]  after his then current lawyer Larry Cheater died I didn't do it quickly I didn't do it
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:57.980]  surreptitiously or frivolously because of the exactly what you say I have to be very
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:07.020]  careful I try to be very careful about getting involved in causes and fights because if it's
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:13.140]  not well if your fight is not well grounded if your position is not substantial you do
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:18.980]  get attacked and if you make a mistake along the way and no matter how small or minor that
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:23.060]  of course will be magnified so you really do have to be when you're coming up against
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:29.380]  the forces involved in these kinds of cases and I'm talking about political assassinations
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:35.620]  you really do have to be very careful and I studied that file for a better part of a
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:42.220]  couple of years and before I finally agreed to do it remember when I agreed to represent
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:49.620]  James Earl Ray I had taken 10 years of working on that case before I agreed to represent
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:54.820]  James who was after me for a long time to do it because I wanted to be absolutely certain
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:59.300]  that he had he played not only did he not do it but he played no knowing role in the
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:05.740]  assassination of Martin King so I started in 78 it was 88 before I took him on with
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:13.420]  respect to Serhan we came on and around 2007 I guess after really went carefully through
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:19.820]  the file now this was a particularly important case for me personally because as I knew Martin
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:24.260]  King the last year of his life and was very close to him during that period when I was
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:30.780]  much younger and I'd come back as a journalist from Vietnam I also knew Bobby Kennedy I was
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:37.180]  his citizens chairman when he ran for the Senate in New York State in 1964 in Westchester
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:44.780]  County I ran his campaign and I was very young I had a fairly large following of reform
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.860]  hang on Dr Pepper we're gonna we're gonna continue I want to hear the rest of this and
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.260]  I know everybody's gonna want to hear about the Serhan Serhan case because it's not an
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:55.700]  open and shut case as we've been told hang on we'll be right back after the break stay
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.700]  tuned.

[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:14.780]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. William Pepper
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:22.120]  who had a trial for the Martin Luther King assassination the trial that James Earl Ray never got and
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.620]  just recently he has moved for a retrial of Sirhan Sirhan based on some new evidence that
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:33.820]  turned up in 2004 and it's very interesting to see that it may take a very long time as
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.220]  he mentioned just before the break he spent 10 years investigating the Martin Luther King
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:43.100]  assassination before he decided to take the case even though he was in touch with the
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:48.760]  Martin Luther King family they had questions about the story as presented by the government
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.900]  and of course there had never been a trial because James Earl Ray pled guilty so that
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:57.540]  he would not get the death penalty and it takes a long time for the truth to come out
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.660]  we're just learning this week that a new documentary is coming out about the Oklahoma about the
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:09.020]  flight 800 the TWA flight 800 that happened about 17 years ago blew up in mid-air had
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:14.660]  a lot of witnesses say that they saw a missile they saw something that looked like flares
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:21.500]  going out and up to the plane and then exploding in the plane we had transcriptions of pilots
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:26.440]  talking to the air traffic control saying the similar thing we had the FBI going around
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:31.400]  and confiscating data from people now we've got six whistleblowers who are probably now
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.260]  retired and want to get the truth out we saw the same thing with the Oklahoma City bombing
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:41.380]  with a noble lie and now we have a documentary that is coming out from info wars we're going
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:48.420]  to have that exclusively here at info wars shop.com and that is state of mind and it
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:52.180]  talks about mind control and how that's been around for quite some time and that actually
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:59.860]  plays a part in the Sirhan Sirhan story tell us a little bit about that Dr. Pepper right
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:08.520]  well I mean we can go through the the listening of evidence in the Sirhan case he um we became
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.620]  convinced that he is uh was totally actually innocent uh of the assassination was used
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:25.780]  as a patsy we had initially suspected that there was uh some um mind control activity
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:33.820]  at work um because of his his failure to remember very critical events in the in the pantry
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:42.580]  consistently historically over the years which would in fact have uh enabled him to to explain
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:49.660]  what was happening so what we one of the things we did was to bring in Dr. uh Dr. Daniel Brown
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:59.020]  from uh from Harvard who is a specialist in um and hypnoprogramming hypnoprogramming doesn't
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:06.300]  mean uh hypnotism alone it's the use of chemicals and drugs in combination with hypnosis and
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:10.860]  this is something that the CIA has admitted to be to doing since the at least the 60s
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:14.500]  going back to the 50s actually with Frank Olson it was already well into it he died
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:20.300]  sometime in the 1950s yeah they've been they've been involved in this tactic for quite a long
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:26.760]  period of time right and and have developed it with a degree of sophistication Dan spent
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:33.860]  over 70 hours uh a period over a period of three years and seven seventy uh seventy different
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:43.100]  um uh sessions with with Sirhan and we have filed his massive reported opinion and affidavit
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:51.540]  and it's pretty clear that Sirhan was in fact um put through a a two-week mind control session
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:58.020]  at a specific clinic now he Sirhan claims that he doesn't remember shooting actually
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:03.100]  he thought he was at a shooting range is that correct yes yeah they this is what they had
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:08.380]  programmed him to to recall that he had been at a shooting range that afternoon and they
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:14.220]  he was programmed on cue which was a pinch on the neck for the handler the handler was
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:22.980]  a uh a woman uh who attached herself to him in the hotel and went into the pantry and
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:29.540]  sat with him and effectively controlled him he is he was used prime well fundamentally
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:37.220]  just to distract he was used to on the pinch to get up and see a a target uh a shooting
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:45.460]  range target in front of him and then began to pull the trigger um he he got off two shots
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:53.000]  and then he was swamped and his hand was pinned to the table and we had uh we have six eyewitnesses
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.220]  who saw him being pinned to the table after the arm to the table after the second shot
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:03.780]  so he he kept pulling the trigger robotically uh with but his hand was on the table and
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:11.260]  the bullets were careening all over the pantry meanwhile the actual assassin put three bullets
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:17.740]  at powder burn range into the back of senator kennedy uh two into his coat and one through
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:23.260]  his right ear which which the end of the brain which killed him and that that was that was
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:28.460]  the fatal shot a fourth shot went through uh his shoulder pad so four shots were fired
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:34.940]  from the rear serhan was never in the rear he was always in front of the senate i mean
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:41.860]  we have 12 witnesses eyewitnesses independently always placed him in front of the center never
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:45.820]  amazing amazing revelation we're going to continue on with that extraordinary we've

[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:29.980]  and I'm talking to Dr. William Pepper and he's trying to get a retrial for Sirhan Sirhan
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:36.140]  the accused killer of Robert Kennedy we're talking just before the break about how Sirhan
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:41.580]  Sirhan maintains and Dr. Peppers had testimony from expert psychologist he maintains that
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.200]  he was under mind control that he did not know where he was or what he was doing he
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.560]  believed that he was shooting at a target range and Dr. Pepper was just telling us before
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:57.780]  the break that he only got two shots off and then people around him pinned his hand to
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:03.820]  the table and he continued to fire until he fired all eight shots and he fired randomly
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:10.140]  into the crowd of spectators there meanwhile Robert Kennedy was killed with three shots
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:17.060]  from behind at point blank range as Dr. Pepper puts it powder burn range and he was just
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:21.540]  telling us about some of the details about that this is not just assertions think about
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:29.060]  how this was played in the media think about how they focused on the open and shut case
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:34.020]  here we have a person shooting Robert Kennedy as he's walking through the hotel lobby and
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.180]  we've got it all on videotape and here's what we saw and they just tell you what they saw
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:43.220]  and they don't talk about the fact that witnesses pinned his hand to the to the table after
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:48.300]  just two shots they just maintained that that's the truth it's a consistent story across the
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:53.700]  media because they only had three different networks now I guess you could say we've got
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:57.920]  basically one network that's telling the same story people hear the same story every channel
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.060]  they turn to so that's evidently the truth but it's not is it Dr. Pepper no it's certainly
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:12.560]  not the truth the corporate media is not going to reveal the truthful facts about these kinds
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:19.820]  of cases because the government is involved and they will continue and perpetuate the
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:25.100]  cover up to the extent that they can for as long as they possibly can you know Bernstein
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:30.420]  conference being alluded us to the fact that there were over 400 intelligence agents spread
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:35.940]  throughout all of the media in America and in very senior positions as well as as as
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:46.460]  stringers and they they make a point of influencing what goes in and what stays out the masses
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:51.780]  are not going to be told that what really has happened there was some new evidence that
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:36:00.220]  came out in 2004 tell us about that audio tape yeah there was a there was an audio tape
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:07.740]  recorder that was was running by a it's called the Brzezinski tape by a a a a journalist
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:14.060]  researcher who was there and it it had been known from the beginning and it was a part
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:22.900]  of the archival evidence but there it was not possible to do the the kind of very precise
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:30.260]  analysis of the sounds on that tape and it really that technology only developed in the
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:39.340]  in the in the middle of the 2000s 2005 2006 and and we were able to get a a computerized
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:45.620]  analysis of the sounds on the tape and it indicated that 13 bullets they identified
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:51.820]  13 bullets as having been fired they were the 13 bullets were fired from two different
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:58.060]  directions west to east and east to west Serhan was firing east to west bullets came the other
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:04.580]  way from west to east there were there were two different types of guns they were both
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:11.780]  22 calibers but there was there were there was these a a slightly different it's amazing
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:17.780]  and that they can they can detail it's a sort of like a radiological difference in the weapons
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:24.340]  that were fired and there were some overlapping shots which means when Serhan fired his first
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:29.860]  the two shots and then the balance from the table kept pulling the trigger there were
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:37.260]  there were like shots three four for example were all of the 13 were overlapping so it
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.540]  was very clear there were two guns being fired in the pantry at that time and that of course
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:51.100]  backs up the this the truth that Bob Kennedy was killed from the rear but bullets fired
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:56.660]  in a slightly upward angle with a gun virtually pressed against his body now there was also
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:02.180]  some behind it there was also some physical evidence about the bullets being fired at
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:06.260]  an upward angle too wasn't there wasn't there some bullets that went into the ceiling or
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:11.980]  something like that that yeah there were bullets there were shots that went over and up up
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:22.940]  into the into into the dropped ceiling level and the one that went through Bob's shoulder
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:28.740]  pad was you know was an upward was another upward shot there were four upward shots fired
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:35.060]  three of which from behind him three of which did hit him but it's the kind of evidence
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:43.500]  and the kind of analysis in some cases either was not available or was not presented to
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:52.060]  the jury at the time so we believe that there is a legitimate claim under law for Serhan
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:57.820]  to be given well we think it should be turned loose frankly because of the there were two
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:02.060]  of the two of the bullets that were introduced in evidence were not the real fatal bullets
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:07.860]  we've established that as well they were not bullets but that were that were fired from
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:15.220]  Serhan's gun so the evidence is so strong that we think actual evidence is actual innocence
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:20.700]  is clear and if you're not going to turn them loose of course but we would hope they would
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.780]  give him a new trial they won't give a new trial we would hope at least we can get at
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:31.300]  least we can get an evidentiary hearing where for the first time all of this new evidence
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:37.700]  can be put out and and under oath that's really what we would like to see happen if the matter
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:43.300]  has been in prison that you can imagine for all of these years and for a crime that that
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:47.600]  he didn't commit that's right you might even consider doing a documentary I mean when we
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.100]  go back and look at the Oklahoma City bombings the noble lie went back and talked to so many
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:56.840]  eyewitnesses and put together so much information I was aware of a lot of what had been discovered
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.580]  at the time that it happened I was following it I knew about the bomb blast patterns not
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:06.960]  matching and being testified to that by a former general who was a demolitions expert
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.020]  not matching the kind of blast pattern that you would have from a single bomb single point
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:16.260]  source there was a lot of information like that that it was pretty clear that it didn't
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:20.500]  match the official story there was like I said about flight 800 we have a lot of eyewitnesses
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:25.180]  talking about seeing flares identifying it as a missile as a cruise missile surface air
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:31.740]  missile but in each of these cases we see that the FBI is going around and not only
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:37.060]  not just not doing an investigation but actually taking evidence away and and so that's why
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:42.860]  I think part of this part of the Surhan story as we point out involves mind control and
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:48.020]  that's something that people have kind of laughed off as conspiracy theories or science
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.300]  fiction that's when they but as you said and as we know and as this documentary state of
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:56.980]  the mind is going to point out it is very well documented this has been going on for
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:03.260]  a very long time it was in the 1950s that Frank Olson died at the as we believe at the
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:09.100]  hands of the CIA as his family maintains and he was part of mind control experiments at
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:13.660]  that time in the mid 50s that have been going on for quite some time so I think it's very
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:19.020]  important maybe you might consider doing a documentary to get the story out.
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:25.660]  Well I'm not a filmmaker I'm a lawyer I'm happy to cooperate with people who want to
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:34.100]  do documentaries on these kinds of cases but I've got to you know keep my eye on the issues
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:42.380]  and and do what you know what a human rights lawyer should do try to right a wrong rectify
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:48.460]  an injustice and and that's a pretty big task in itself.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:52.020]  Oh absolutely yeah yeah I understand you're not a filmmaker you're a lawyer and and you
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:56.820]  do what you do very well and we really appreciate you standing up and standing up for the truth
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:00.380]  now you've got a new trial that is coming up that you wanted to talk about that you've
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:03.680]  just started as well can you tell us about that?
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:13.260]  Well it's in the early stages yet and it's yes it's a work of a man who by the name Peter
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:18.300]  Jenny who has published a book called Mary's Mosaic.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:27.520]  Peter worked for worked for about 35 years on that case the Mary in it is Mary Meyer
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:33.120]  now the fascinating thing about this case it's a it's a 50 year old case she was she
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:40.540]  was assassinated in 1964 in Washington DC she was the only woman Jack Kennedy ever loved
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:45.580]  and was very very close to him and it's quite clear he was going to marry her I mean people
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:51.420]  close to them knew that and which had said that after the second term Mary had been married
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:57.940]  as a very prominent Washington person hadn't been married to cord Meyer who was a deputy
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:04.380]  director of the CIA and she just had so much of their operations that she couldn't take
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:10.460]  it and she and she divorced him and then she became close to Jack Kennedy and they really
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:19.500]  had a mission for peace he was about turning him into a real fighter a warrior if you will
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:25.660]  for peace and Jack Kennedy as you know delivered a famous speech at American University and
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:31.780]  began to turn directly in that issue she was beyond that I mean she went to she got Tim
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:39.020]  Leary up at Harvard to give her acid and she took the president believe it or not on his
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:45.660]  only acid trip to try to open him up and and I think she was very successful and very much
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:55.020]  in love and as Peter Jenny has documented so well in his book and his work she came
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:02.980]  to a point when they assassinated Jack Kennedy she knew how it happened and she waited for
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:10.220]  the Warren Commission report to come out that report was a total cover-up as many people
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:18.020]  believe she confronted her ex-husband toward Meyer and and said that quite clearly she
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:23.420]  was going to blow the whistle on him and Jim Angleton and the agency because of their involvement
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:27.620]  in the assassination if they didn't allow the truth to come forward about how Jack was
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:36.100]  killed well I'm you know this is a brave and courageous a marvelous woman and frankly they
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:41.200]  they then assassinated her they killed her on a towpath when she went for a daily walk
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:48.740]  and outside of her home in Georgetown they they had her assassinated they set up a black
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:58.360]  guy Ray Crump they tried they tried him and a wonderful talented lawyer named W Rontree
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.860]  got him acquitted because they didn't have the evidence they didn't have any forensics
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:10.980]  any fibers any they had no evidence and a witness saw someone allegedly this was a part
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:17.140]  of the staging standing over the body was five foot eight inches tall 185 pounds Crump
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:22.940]  was about five three hundred and thirty five pounds I mean it was it was it was ludicrous
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:29.020]  so the jury and that's why we love the jury system isn't it you know they acquitted this
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:36.180]  guy so it's been an unsolved murder to this point in time and Peter Janney has identified
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:44.540]  a key person who was involved in that conspiracy and yes he apparently was an intelligence
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:53.620]  agent he was there he was on the scene and he was used and we are looking at a way and
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:46:00.060]  it's not easy as you could imagine after 50 years but we're looking at a way to try
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:08.420]  to bring this into a courtroom where all the evidence that Peter has uncovered can be put
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:13.620]  before a judge and jury and I took this on I've watched Peter's work for a number
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:19.700]  of years and advised him to state in the background finally agreed to do it to come on as his
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:27.280]  counsel because I came to see that this is maybe the most important of the assassinations
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:33.820]  because it links it links to the assassination of Jack Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy because
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:41.540]  she was of course involved in discussions with the two of them in terms of all kinds
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:47.600]  of matters she visited the White House 40 times in the October before the president
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:57.460]  was killed in November which is very powerful behind the scenes influence to combat the
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:04.540]  Cold War and to bring America away from the Cold War into a peaceful perspective and of
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:08.700]  course that's one of the things that was held against John Kennedy that he was looking
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:14.860]  to normalize relations with Cuba and that he had entered into serious discussions with
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:15.860]  Khrushchev.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:21.980]  When you talk about the you talk about Kennedy's peace movements he actually stopped Operation
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:27.700]  Northwoods which is really kind of a template for 9-11 if people want to know why we believe
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:32.740]  one of the reasons why we believe it is because they had planned it decades before doing exactly
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:34.700]  the same thing.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:40.860]  He walked out of the room one time after another the joint chiefs came at him Curtis LeMay
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:48.460]  and Lemnitzer came at him they wanted a preemptive strike on the Soviet Union a nuclear strike.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:55.900]  One thing after another these military guys were on Kennedy and when he questioned them
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:01.260]  specifically and precisely about detail they didn't have them they didn't know that there
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:06.420]  were a hundred land-based surface missiles throughout Cuba.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:11.820]  They didn't even know that and if there had been the invasion that they were looking to
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:18.380]  mount it would have been a disaster for mainland United States as well as for any invading
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.380]  force.
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:22.940]  Absolutely for people who don't know I mean look at operations Northwoods that was a plan
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:28.820]  to fly planes into buildings and blame it on Cuba so they could have an excuse to attack
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:29.820]  Cuba.
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:35.300]  They had a plan to do bombs in civilian areas a campaign of terrorism so they could blame
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:41.180]  it on Cuba and then invade Cuba and when Lemnitzer when Lemnitzer was let go by Kennedy he goes
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:47.380]  to NATO and you see in NATO you see Operation Gladio where they had a campaign of terror
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:51.660]  there that they then turned around and blamed on the communists so they could move their
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.980]  agenda forward there.
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:58.480]  Well there's no question about that you know and if Bob Kennedy had been elected president
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:05.660]  it was he had made it although on the record and officially he never made this commitment
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:14.260]  but he did to some of who were very close to him and he did say one of his first tasks
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:19.260]  was going to be to reopen the investigation of the assassination of his brother and that
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:24.220]  was a that's a collaboration right across with you know with the encouragement of course
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:25.780]  of Mary Meyer.
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:32.220]  So I think this is a political assassination people don't know about it's an unsolved murder
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:37.340]  and I applaud Peter Jani for all of his work and I'm happy to do what I can do to bring
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:44.940]  those facts to light because they relate to the other critical assassinations on either
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:50.100]  side of her death and I'm happy to do that.
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:55.560]  Well you know it's always a worthwhile thing to go in and search for the truth and I really
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:59.100]  appreciate the fact that as you said you you made sure that you had careful evidence you
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:03.140]  went in and you looked for 10 years at the Martin Luther King assassination before you
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:07.500]  went into it so we don't want to go in half-cocked about stuff and we don't want to start throwing
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:12.180]  around wild accusations but when you see something that's not right when you see something that
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:17.400]  doesn't match the official story it takes a lot of courage to go against that and to
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.580]  stand up and point out the Emperor has no clothes to say that this isn't true that you
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.660]  know here's what really happened even especially when it's something like in the case of Sirhan
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:32.540]  Sirhan where he talks about having been under mind control the public is really not ready
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:37.420]  to accept that on a broad basis yet we have a lot of education to do because as we both
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:42.740]  said this has been going on for over 60 years and they've turned it into something of a
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:48.420]  science this is something that the CIA as well as other black ops have been doing for
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.600]  quite a long time we're gonna be right back with Dr. William Pepper right after the break
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:51:01.940]  stay tuned.

[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:20.060]  housekeeping before we go back to our guest Dr. William Pepper Infidel Body Armor at infidelbodyarmor.com

[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:48.580]  and as we were talking about at the beginning of the hour this amazing case out of Tennessee
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:58.340]  where just complaining about cloudy bad tasting water to the water board caused them to threaten
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:04.300]  the complainers with terrorism not just calling them loony not just calling them conspiracy
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:08.140]  theorists but threatening them and saying you know you better be careful we might talk
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:13.960]  to Homeland Security about you we might out you as a terrorist well you may not be able
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.100]  to get the bureaucrats to do anything to clean up the water but you can take control of it
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:21.540]  yourself to some degree if you live in an area like we do here in Austin where they
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:25.900]  dump a lot of garbage into the water fluoride and other things you can get a propure filter
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:31.980]  you can get that at infowarsstore.com and get 10% off it's gravity filtration it's the
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:36.780]  best way to purify your water unlike reverse osmosis or distillation the propure filters
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:41.740]  don't eliminate the beneficial minerals that are found naturally in the water something
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:47.340]  you can do to help the operation and to take some control over your life because there's
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:52.420]  only so much you can do to get these arrogant bureaucrats now you can't get them to stop
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:57.220]  spending massive amounts of money to take the waste from the aluminum and nuclear industry
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:02.240]  the the fluoride and start dumping it into your water even if you believe that that is
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.120]  beneficial and there's much much science to show that it isn't to show that it increases
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:13.580]  bone cancer and other illnesses even if you believe that it was effective it doesn't make
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:19.420]  any sense whatsoever to mass medicate a population by putting stuff in the water supply you're
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:23.540]  always going to get people that are under medicated or over medicated even if it were
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:29.820]  effective and it's not effective but we were talking to Dr. William Pepper and he's defended
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:35.720]  Sirhan Sirhan trying to get him another trial trying to get it reopened based on new evidence
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:43.060]  that surfaced in 2004 about audio recordings that show that there were multiple guns and
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:47.060]  that there were 13 shots fired and talking about how there was even physical evidence
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:53.620]  of the shots in the ceiling it was upward shots shot from behind that actually killed
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:59.180]  Robert Kennedy and Sirhan Sirhan was in front and he was actually maintains that he did
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:04.600]  not know where he was he didn't know that he had shot Sirhan Sirhan had shot Robert
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:09.660]  Kennedy he was told that he had and believed it based on what he had been told sounds very
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:15.440]  similar to the shooting that we had in Aurora Colorado and there's a lot to be done in terms
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.100]  of educating the public as to what the CIA has been doing we had some revelations of
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:26.020]  the church committee hearings in the 1970s where the CIA confessed to quite a bit of
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:30.660]  things that was news to the general public that have been talked about by other people
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:36.140]  and we know that for at least 60 years the government has been making a science out of
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:40.860]  mind control that's something that the general public just doesn't understand yet and we
[01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:46.540]  have a documentary that's coming out that you can pre-book right now at info wars store
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:51.860]  dot com mind control it's about the psychology of mind control and what's been done in these
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:56.500]  programs over the last several decades dr pepper we were just talking about the new
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:01.100]  trial that you're getting involved in tell us a little bit about that and we've got a
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:05.380]  couple more minutes tell us where you want to try to take that you're trying to get that
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:10.020]  case reopen and actually i guess trying to do a prosecution based on the evidence that
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:16.740]  you've got there is that correct well i i think um we're exploring all of the all of
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:23.020]  the possible uh avenues the whole idea is to is to get a judicial setting whether it's
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:30.100]  civil or criminal where the evidence that um peter janney has has has dug up and others
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:38.740]  have dug up as well um and um that's good we're gonna we're gonna talk to you we're

[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:45.200]  hour right after this break now also in this hour we're going to premiere alex's video
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:49.620]  about superman the review of superman and also i'll get you what you would call a preview
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:54.740]  of world war z now i'm pretty sure many people are familiar with the superman film but for
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:01:01.060]  world war z those who are not familiar it's a zombie movie and it's about how the how
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:05.900]  great the u.n. is and how bad the rest of us are you know if you're one of the elites
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.560]  when the elect you can go off to the uh the aircraft carriers or whatever when the zombie
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:14.860]  plague comes but if you're just a normal person trying to live your everyday life when the
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:18.180]  zombie invasion comes that's that's it for you and i haven't had a chance to see the
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:22.420]  film myself i believe david knight had a chance to watch it last night but i have seen superman
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:28.060]  and i'll talk about that a little bit in preview before watson joins us in the next few minutes
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:32.700]  i went out and saw superman this past week and it was a very very interesting film you
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:36.380]  know i'm a big comic book guy so i may have some critiques about it that other people
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:41.060]  don't get but by and large i thought it was a very good family friendly film you know
[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:45.620]  if you have maybe about a 12 or 13 year old it's probably very appropriate for them it's
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:49.660]  not as near as dark as uh the batman movie so it's uh i think it's good for the whole
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:55.160]  family by and large uh there's a lot of criticism about the film as far as uh religious aspects
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:02:00.340]  of it and i will admit it does does have a very heavy uh christian tone to it uh there's
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:03.580]  even one point this isn't a big spoiler but there's even one point in the film where superman
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:08.240]  actually goes to church so i guess some people were offended by that or you know had whatever
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.340]  feelings about that but it's a good positive movie but it does talk about things such as
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:17.540]  eugenics drones a lot of other things that i thought were pretty interesting it was a
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:23.180]  very entertaining film uh had time uh on krypton and all that so it's a very special effects
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:26.980]  heavy film very interesting if you're like me and you were turned off by the last superman
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:32.020]  movie because there was really no action or anything to that effect it's uh very entertaining
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:36.260]  uh they punch people through walls and big explosions and all that good stuff so i thought
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:40.000]  it was a very entertaining film and people ask you know why do you guys talk about movies
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.780]  like superman why do you talk about video games it's because it's uh it's propaganda
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:48.160]  it's it can be conditioning or it could be in some cases a warning and various people
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.660]  have their opinions about this or that but you know the last video game review i did
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:56.340]  was for a video game called rainbow six patriots and this is a game that's going to come out
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:02.260]  of the next generation consoles xbox one and also playstation 4 and this is a video game
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:08.140]  about how a special operations group called the rainbow six go out and they tackle the
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:12.980]  terrorist and this particular threat happens to be patriots domestic terrorists as i guess
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:17.820]  they call them in this new video game the rainbow six is a uh it's a long line of video
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:21.460]  games i'm not exactly sure how many they have in the series but this isn't their first rodeo
[02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:27.620]  and they chose to choose a domestic threat saying that people who um are upset about
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:32.740]  uh banker bailouts people who may be associated in activism groups such as occupy wall street
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:37.060]  and things like that they may just have a screw loose and actually the trailer we're
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:41.140]  not going to play it right here because our time is short but in the trailer you can see
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:44.860]  these guys they walk in they say i could skin a buck i could run a trout line and i'll kill
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:48.380]  your wife if you don't do exactly what i say and they strap this guy up with a bomb and
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:52.980]  then the hero rainbow six they come in they're shooting police and throwing hostages off
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:57.140]  bridges and stuff i'm not making this stuff up and you know people have said that they're
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:01.540]  very unhappy with ubisoft the game's publisher and have gone to their facebook page and if
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:05.340]  you go to the ubisoft facebook page you can see it right there half the the comments are
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:09.540]  just negative comments about rainbow six and ubisoft makes many more games than rainbow
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:13.700]  six but people's like i'm not buying ubisoft games anymore i'm tired of you guys with all
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:18.340]  this propaganda pushing this in our face saying that patriots are bad people who support the
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:22.780]  second amendment are bad and it's not just you know rainbow six we also see this in a
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:27.340]  lot of the tv shows and movies and and other things such as that alex and i did a report
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:32.140]  a little bit back called hollywood hates militiamen and we should document how the demonize and
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:36.180]  how they're demonizing militia groups and so forth people who uh just care about their
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:39.820]  country if you know the constitution if you can quote the constitution you're some evil
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:44.660]  sovereign citizen we've seen that on 60 minutes and so forth but our break is coming up and
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:05:01.260]  i do believe we'll have paul joseph watson with us right after this break so stay tuned
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:05.780]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:11.640]  history every great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars

[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:52.480]  you back then and have even more of a dragnet on you now welcome back to the alex jones
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.480]  radio show i'm jakari jackson filling in i want to thank dave knight of course for doing
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:00.180]  the first two hours and now we're going to go to paul joseph watson who's going to take
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:08.080]  us out for the rest of the show paul hi jakari good to be here thanks for joining us yeah
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:14.920]  we're talking about the death of michael hastings the rolling stone journalist now as you know
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:20.380]  we often get accused of saying that everything's a conspiracy theory i'm not i don't involve
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:26.560]  myself in that i think that certain events are accidents or genuinely organic events
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:32.120]  an example would be the woolwich attack last month i put out a youtube video which ended
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:37.980]  up getting 500 000 viewers basically saying that yes this was a real event it was it wasn't
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:45.340]  staged by crisis actors and we got a lot of heat for that but now this incident involving
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:52.080]  michael hastings the rolling stone journalist certainly has a lot of suspicion attached
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:57.760]  to it with new developments today so if you want to introduce you know what happened then
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:05.420]  we can get into the evidence since he was a rolling stones writer he was allegedly driving
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:09.560]  down the street in his mercedes bins at a high rate of speed the story says he allegedly
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.940]  struck a tree and the car burst into flames now i'm very interested in hearing from mercedes
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:19.560]  as to whether or not their car spontaneously combust i'd love to hear them uh you know
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:25.620]  retort that statement but uh if you watch the watch the videos or see the pictures you'll
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:29.740]  see that most of the damage done to the vehicle appears to be done to the back you can see
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:33.380]  it right there if you're watching on prison planet tv and also has some hefty damage to
[02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:39.320]  the front but why is the back end so heavily damaged if he struck a tree head on uh that's
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:42.940]  the question that many people are asking there's speculations that there may have been a bomb
[02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:46.900]  planted in the vehicle speculations maybe even a drone took him out you know like i
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:52.060]  said i can't vet that one way the other but he had also made some uh very powerful enemies
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:57.500]  one uh mccrystal as well as many other high-ranking officials just didn't like this guy he also
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:02.300]  said himself hastings did you know when you go against these dudes this is a paraphrase
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:07.580]  he said when you go against these dudes a lot of them want you dead precisely and that's
[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:14.260]  what he was most known for was the 2010 rolling stone expose of general stanley mccrystal
[02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:20.780]  where he basically exposed the fact that the top generals in the military were being denigratory
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:24.860]  towards the obama administration they were they were having bickering between the two
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:32.260]  and that ended up obviously in general mccrystal being fired and replaced with patreus uh according
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:39.140]  to la weekly uh hastings was also working on an expose of the cia uh in the weeks before
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:46.520]  his death and we also found out that he contacted a wikileaks lawyer in the very hours before
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:51.900]  the quote accident that's right fearing the fact that he was being investigated by the
[02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:58.600]  fbi which the fbi came out today and denied that they had any dealings with him despite
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:03.820]  the fact that his body was only identified yesterday as a result of the coroner in los
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:10.180]  angeles matching the fingerprints with those held on file by the fbi and we know the fbi
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:15.220]  never lies paul because they had a situation with the tamarind associate the boxer the
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:19.500]  mma fighter and they go and talk to this guy and first the guy lunged at him and because
[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:23.140]  he had a knife and then he didn't have a knife and they just started shooting and he ended
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:28.980]  up dead so we know that they never falsify any uh any statements well exactly i mean
[02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:34.660]  that carried on for about a week didn't it this guy was shot six times in the head toddershef
[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:39.820]  he was obviously a friend with one of the accused boston bombers for about almost a
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:45.460]  week if i recall the fbi was saying he had a weapon he lunged at them it was self-defense
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:50.720]  on behalf of the agents later had to admit that was complete baloney he didn't have a
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:55.460]  weapon he didn't lunge at anyone and that investigation seems to have just you know
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:59.100]  tailed off into nothing and he also told his friend that he didn't want his friend to leave
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:04.940]  because he was in fear for his life precisely and there's also this this new report about
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:12.980]  the fbi which came out yesterday um they investigated themselves basically in incidents of fbi shooting
[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:21.420]  other people involved in cases over the last 20 years since 1993 and in 150 incidents of
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:28.020]  people being shot by the fbi i believe it was 80 killed 70 injured the fbi said that
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:34.380]  there was no wrongdoing in any of those 150 cases despite the fact that one was known
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:40.100]  to be somebody they mistook for a bank robber they shot and i believe injured him he got
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:45.500]  he won in court he got a settlement and still the fbi cleared themselves and said that that
[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:52.820]  wasn't a case of wrongdoing in fbi agent shooting other people in every single case 150 people
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:59.080]  shot over the last 20 years the fbi says no wrongdoing so based on that evidence can you
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:05.120]  really trust them that they had no involvement with hastings even though they identified
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:10.160]  his fingerprints from the body as a result of matching them with fbi prints of hastings
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:14.620]  that they had on record so they must have had some dealings with him but now they come
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:19.420]  out today and say we had nothing to do with it despite the fact that hastings in the hours
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:25.660]  before his death contacted this wikileaks lawyer and said they were investigating me
[02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:30.480]  exactly exactly and you know reports are still coming in i'm interested in what the eye witnesses
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:35.700]  have to say they say they heard some say they saw some said they heard an explosion go off
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:39.700]  and then you know the engine is flying down the street and so forth and i think about
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:43.420]  you know when you watch a uh a nascar race and so forth and you see these horrendous
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:48.300]  wrecks there's a lot of shrapnel and so forth but i've i don't recall ever seeing an engine
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:53.660]  fly down the raceway well here's the thing this is what strikes me about it and i'm not
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:58.180]  a technical expert in any of this but this is what a lot of the people on all the car
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:04.700]  websites all the vehicle experts are saying the engine and the transmission from the vehicle
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:09.260]  was found this is this is public knowledge now it was found and we've got pictures of
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:15.420]  it a hundred feet away from the scene of the crash the supposed crash up against the tree
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:21.620]  so the engine flies out a hundred feet away and that that's not suspicious they also had
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:26.540]  a white sheet if you look at some of the pictures they've put a white sheet over the front of
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:31.860]  the vehicle for whatever reason i don't know some people are claiming the front of the
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:36.900]  vehicle is basically entirely missing which is not consistent with a crash it's more consistent
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:43.140]  with some kind of incendiary device and even those who are calling us you know calling
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:49.760]  the questioning of his death a trutherism in that pejorative debunking term even they're
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.700]  saying that certain aspects of this are suspicious and to not ask questions about it in light
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:16:02.980]  of the fact that we know he had made numerous enemies in high places cia fbi the military
[02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:07.920]  generals it would be completely remiss not to ask questions about it and then on top
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:14.980]  of that his colleagues all said he was paranoid he was freaked out he was a nervous wreck
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:20.480]  in the days before this happened he this is a quote he was incredibly tense and very worried
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:24.700]  and was concerned that the government was looking in on his material said one of his
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:31.140]  colleagues also his editor at buzzfeed ben smith said that hastings had told his family
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:36.140]  and friends quote he was concerned that he was under investigation and then another friend
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:42.620]  of hastings said he was very paranoid that he was being watched by the fbi so all his
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:47.620]  friends are saying he's paranoid he's a nervous wreck we know he was also very concerned about
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:53.700]  the ap wiretapping scandal of journalists he believed he was a target he was doing stories
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:59.660]  on the cia he was doing a story on the fbi in relation to the portrayess scandal and
[02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:06.660]  he winds up dead after his mercedes which is one of the safest cars in the world basically
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:12.000]  a brand new model appears to explode into flames after hitting a tree then you look
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.340]  at some of the pictures there's very little damage to the tree and the actual crash seems
[02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:23.060]  more consistent with the vehicle having some kind of incendiary device planted in it rather
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:27.180]  than just a straightforward crash that's not what i'm saying that's what a lot of the experts
[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:31.820]  on these vehicle websites have said about it so you tie it in with the fact that he
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:37.340]  was a known enemy of the establishment he had all these uh blockbusters apparently coming
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:43.020]  up about to be released as you said earlier jakari he had received death threats from
[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:46.840]  staffers linked to mc crystal they said we're going to come after you we're going to kill
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:51.800]  you he also received death threats from other people which is documented in his book you've
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:57.060]  got the death threats you've got he's a nervous wreck before he's paranoid apparently under
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:02.340]  investigation by the fbi uh getting ready to release all these stories exactly now paul
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:05.900]  i want to chime in on one thing that you said that's very important we talked about the
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:10.500]  tarp over the vehicle why would they need a tarp to cover up this vehicle i think about
[02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:15.780]  a similar situation on 911 at the pentagon when they were uh taking i guess shrapnel
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:19.900]  or whatever else out of the pentagon and they brought out this big blue tarp to cover up
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:24.100]  whatever they were bringing out like why do you need to cover that up and not even talking
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:28.020]  about the pentagon but talk about a car wreck i've never seen a car wreck where they covered
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:33.100]  up anything beside the body of the victim well that's what my first thought was maybe
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:37.780]  that covering up to hide the charred body of the victim but if you look it's you know
[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:41.760]  you could just look in the passenger window and see the victim so that can't be the reason
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:48.140]  for it the reports that i've read state that the police arrived on the scene almost immediately
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:52.580]  which in you know these days of austerity and cutbacks you rarely see that takes them
[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:58.540]  at least 10 15 minutes so they were on the scene immediately this this white tarp gets
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:02.860]  thrown over the vehicle and then you've got all the questions about the damage to the
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:07.500]  vehicle there appears to be you know the the front of the car appears to be completely
[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:12.660]  missing in a couple of photos which suggests that's why they put the tarp on for whatever
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:17.660]  reason i don't know so there are a lot of questions about it there's a lot of motive
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:22.980]  behind it that's the thing if you take the example of woolwich which i said was a natural
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:29.700]  incident wasn't staged according to the evidence um there seemingly was no motive to stage
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:35.100]  that incident but in the in the death of hastings there's motive on behalf of a ton of different
[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:41.500]  people linked to you know the highest positions of power cia fbi department of justice okay
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:45.460]  paul paul hold that thought we have to go to break and you paul's bringing a very good
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:48.580]  point we'll talk about all that we'll talk about the fbi when they're drones they say
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:51.820]  yeah we have drones but we don't use them all that much we'll talk about all that right
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:20:01.220]  on the other side

[02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:15.460]  i have this article right here that we were referencing talking about the fbi the fbi
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:20.460]  has received aviation clearance for at least four domestic drone operations and it goes
[02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:25.140]  on to have the quotes from euler where he says we very very rarely use these things
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:31.900]  in a minimal way and very seldom and very few and all these very small accounts according
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:35.200]  to him so paul you were also talking about the fbi so go ahead and finish your thought
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:41.260]  on that yeah well with regard to the drones are trying to sell this myth that it's you
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:46.340]  know just a few occasions they've used them for years the department of homeland security
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:52.480]  has been pouring millions of dollars into local police departments to develop domestic
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:58.020]  drone programs for quote public safety if you go to an article i wrote back in february
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:05.780]  dhs advances plan for public safety drones this documents how their program robotic aircraft
[02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:11.660]  for public safety has been ongoing for years uh police departments get anything from a
[02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:17.420]  quarter to a half million dollars every time they launch one of these domestic drone programs
[02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:22.480]  so it's already been underway domestically for years under the auspices of the department
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:28.340]  of homeland security uh and the fbi is no different of course he had the video which
[02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:35.940]  we put out from uh the shadow hawk drone which is this 50 pound mini helicopter uh again
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:41.580]  funded by the dhs police departments across america are buying it with the aid of dhs
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:48.420]  funding and the promotional video for that drone shows it spying on a quote illegal gun
[02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:57.500]  sale for illegal gun sales in the us according to their own promotional propaganda so the
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:03.380]  fact that domestic drones have been on the agenda you know the faa says what 30 000 drones
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:08.020]  in american skies within the next 10 years it's already been happening for years and
[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:13.900]  i think one of the most popular misconceptions about drones is that they will be these huge
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:20.320]  predator type things they won't in five to ten years they're going to have insect drones
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:26.700]  they're already developing them under darper and other different agencies insect size drones
[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:30.940]  that are going to whiz around your backyard and spy on you so it's not going to be very
[02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:34.940]  visible but it's going to be plentiful because they're going to get them down to a smaller
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:39.780]  and smaller size and also we see them not just the insect drones but you know one of
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:44.620]  the i guess retail type that you can go to a surveillance store not just a surveillance
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:49.440]  store but a electronic store and purchase you can rig these things up with cameras we've
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:54.260]  also seen you can go on youtube and watch fps russia shoot one of those little drones
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:58.900]  and it has a gun attached to it i mean these things are very real very feasible especially
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:04.820]  as technology advances and these things become more readily available oh certainly the the
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:10.020]  shadow hawk drone that i mentioned has the capability for a a 12 gauge shotgun to be
[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:14.980]  attached as well as a taser device so they're going to have them for surveillance they're
[02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:18.700]  going to have them weaponized and you know we're going to be living in a they-live type
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:24.780]  scenario but even the makers of the drones uh like david cenciotti who helped develop
[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:28.880]  some of these swarm drones that work together have openly said they're going to be used
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:35.500]  for homeland security purposes hunting terrorists you know the dhs identifies as terrorists
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:40.220]  so the scope of this is all going domestic over the next few years and it's it's kind
[02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:45.980]  of like the nsa revelation with the fbi revelation about the drones we already knew it was happening
[02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:51.180]  and now suddenly everybody is concerned about it we've been concerned about it for years
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:55.800]  exactly and just like you alluded to the new domestic threat uh the terrorists the tea
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:00.620]  parties the guys with the gats and flags and uh skin bucks and run trot lines but paul

[02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:23.420]  welcome back to the alex jones radio show jakari jackson and paul jones with watson filling in now
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:27.340]  before we go back to paul we have this clip we'd like to premiere here on the radio this is alex
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:34.140]  jones's breakdown of the new superman movie and also world war z brits nolan and david goyer that
[02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:42.260]  brought us the blockbuster dark knight trilogy have now put out the man of steel they are throwing
[02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:52.220]  in your face the memes that the global elite are actually obsessed with genetic engineering eugenics
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:34:00.100]  world government terraforming it's all there and i'm going to break down the dichotomy between the
[02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:18.740]  messages in superman the man of steel and world war z with brad pitt the director and the writers
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:25.300]  of the dark knight especially in the third installment put out deep french revolution
[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:32.180]  illuminati jacobin ideology for someone that has researched this information it was a very
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:40.220]  disturbing film and shows that the writers and the director have a deep knowledge of what's going on
[02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:45.980]  in secret societies and that's why it's so shocking to go see the man of steel which is
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:54.500]  undoubtedly the best comic book adaptation to film i've ever seen and had about a 98% rating
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:35:03.620]  towards pro-liberty there are very few things that are pro globalist anti-human propaganda in the
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:11.220]  film my main criticism is is it shows the fbi paramilitary pointing guns at lois lane interface
[02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:17.980]  as if she's a threat and done something wrong and basically kidnapping her so it does promote the
[02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:27.540]  police state but other than that from a to z this film is a revolution against the goals of the
[02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:35.020]  globalist another criticism that some students of esoteric knowledge can bring forth is that it is a
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:43.100]  pro-antichrist film though i disagree with that view you have the god man who falls from the
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:51.180]  stars to earth he is 33 years old when he's forced to go public to save humanity in the original 1933
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:59.260]  writing he's clearly a christ figure whose father is named joseph and his mother is named mary and
[02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:05.260]  the makers of this new film and the writers admit that he is a christ figure but i wouldn't call him
[02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:12.540]  an anti-christ figure because he supports free will and he supports the general humanity whereas
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:21.260]  the true anti-christ figure i would say is more represented by general zod general zod though
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:28.620]  believes that he should control creation and wants to terraform an already living planet
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:36.460]  to re-engineer it to recreate krypton here on earth jor-el superman's father represents the
[02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:43.740]  archetypal renaissance figure of renewal or expansion and liberty who is blocked by the
[02:36:43.740 --> 02:36:50.460]  krypton council and other corrupt forces from trying to save his species so the film also
[02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:55.900]  points out that the ruling elite is stagnant and corrupt and is not infallible and is the
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:37:02.860]  greatest threat to humanity jor-el also criticizes the genetic engineering of the species into
[02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:08.940]  specialized eugenics-based groups instead of allowing natural development of the species
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:16.380]  let me introduce the paul revere scale now that we're going to begin using in info wars.com movie
[02:37:16.380 --> 02:37:24.540]  reviews the more horses the more pro-liberty pro-human empowerment the film is and on a scale
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:33.180]  of one to ten i would give superman man of steel nine horses there are literally hundreds of deep
[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:41.260]  archetypal messages in this film and regardless of what you think about it it is deep on many many
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:47.820]  levels superman and this is a spoiler alert at the end takes out a predator drone that is spying on
[02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:53.980]  him and explains that it's wrong to violate people's privacy there's a lot of pro-liberty
[02:37:53.980 --> 02:37:59.100]  messages also as a child he has x-ray vision so he sees people's beating hearts they're
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:05.180]  they're skeletons and that's a metaphor or an allegory of people that are very entombed and
[02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:15.580]  intelligent who are actually driven mad by how complex reality is and it's a allegory of the
[02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:22.060]  burden of the highly intelligent who are not predatory and who don't decide to use their
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:28.300]  advanced intelligence to suppress and dominate the rest of humanity overall it's an anti
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:35.260]  centralization message it's an anti-military industrial complex message it's an anti-eugenics
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:42.700]  message it's an anti-stagnant inbred monopoly elite message the message is we must have a
[02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:48.220]  renaissance and reach for the stars and overall it is one of the most positive films i've seen
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:55.180]  in a long time and it follows a rebellion in hollywood that i have been basically informed of
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:59.980]  from multiple high-level sources over the last few years that they're tired of the left-right
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:05.740]  paradigm that you're either a liberal socialist communist anti-gun person or you're allowed to be
[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:11.020]  kind of a neo-con warmonger conservative the people are voting with their dollars voting with
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:16.860]  their eyes with what they watch and we are forcing more and more wholesome messages to come out
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:23.100]  like ed asner and the movie up like oblivion i'm not even a tom cruise fan but that message
[02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:28.700]  is anti-tyranny anti-technocracy anti-compartmentalization and there's more and more of
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:35.100]  these films coming out like ellisium that is absolutely exposing the robotic technocracy
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:41.100]  now let's look at world war z i was able to get some of the early scripts about six months ago we
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:47.260]  also have the book which i've read world war z and now they've gone into multiple rewrites and
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:53.260]  reshoots so as the film prepares to come out we are not a hundred percent exactly what's in it
[02:39:53.260 --> 02:39:59.100]  but we do have the early script and we're going to have a look at some of the early scripts that
[02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:04.540]  we're going to be talking about in the next few months and we're going to be talking about the
[02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:09.740]  movie and we do have the earlier versions and they're very similar to the book which is an
[02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:18.620]  anti-human pro-elite pro-mass extermination manifesto that i can only describe as ultra
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:28.140]  hitlerian they say in the book and in earlier versions of the film that there's nothing worse
[02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:34.140]  than american militias and gun owners and thank god the zombie apocalypse happened because at
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:40.940]  the same time it reduced the numbers of humans worldwide and allowed the un to invade america
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:47.740]  and put gun owners and families in concentration camps they praise communism in the book and in
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:54.700]  the earlier screenplays it is a piece of authoritarian pornography and despite the fact
[02:40:54.700 --> 02:41:02.300]  it has a mega budget and brad pitt is behind it i predict this film will not perform as good as
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:09.100]  more wholesome messages people are sick of the psychic poison the globalists want to turn off
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:15.100]  our life force turn off our self-preservation instinct they want to teach us it's sexy and cool
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:21.420]  to be anti-human and in the book and the earlier screenplays they talk about how being cold-blooded
[02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:27.260]  and exterminating masses of people and feeding families to the zombies was the smart thing to do
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:33.900]  and how the united nations use the crisis to bring in their global government and finally crush
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:40.060]  right-wing libertarians in america and then you look at the big mega banks that control the world
[02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:44.940]  and are setting up global taxation and who are above the law and exempt through the un and have
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:48.620]  diplomatic community this is what they're promoting there's going to be a worldwide
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:54.780]  biological release that reduces world population and that the un will manage the globe during this
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:42:02.620]  crisis this is all basically a jim jones kool-aid drinking drill jim jones had his followers in
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:09.420]  guiana hundreds of times drill drinking the kool-aid until finally they put the cyanide in it
[02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:14.140]  and everybody poisoned themselves and that's what this is just get ready for a major collapse
[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:18.780]  and those of you that work for the technocracy who are specialists like the brad pitt character
[02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:23.660]  you'll get to go be on the ships safe from the bioweapon release you'll get to go to the
[02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:28.940]  underground bases during the mass calamity and collapse that is coming and then i researched
[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:33.500]  their underground seed banks their martial law plans they're actually gearing up for something
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:39.180]  like this and they've got all these scientists and top police and military signed on to believing
[02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:44.060]  they're going to be protected during all this i have not seen it yet it's coming out tomorrow
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:50.060]  but i've read the book seen the early screenplays i would have to give it zero paul reveres as an
[02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:57.580]  anti-human treatise selling the zombies as the liberators of humanity selling the image of
[02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:05.820]  humanity as a bunch of walking dead thoroughly disgusting so i give world war z zero paul reveres
[02:43:06.860 --> 02:43:14.140]  so world war z is a dress rehearsal for worldwide planetary genocide and a re-engineering of our
[02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:22.380]  planet they're selling general zod's takeover as a good thing in world war z and so that's why i
[02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:30.220]  hope that world war z is a failure and that positive films like oblivion and man of steel
[02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:36.220]  and up and so many others become the norm because there's a fight for the heart and soul of hollywood
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:41.900]  right now and regardless of what you think about hollywood it is the worldwide propaganda channel
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:47.740]  of the globalist and you're seeing a spiritual fight a cultural fight for the future of humanity
[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:53.580]  taking place right now i'm alex jones with info wars.com this is another film review
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:59.980]  superman the man of steel versus world war z only at info wars.com
[02:43:59.980 --> 02:44:16.060]  all right and there was the review for world war z versus the man of steel and i haven't seen
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:20.460]  world war z it just came out but i'm pretty sure superman's gonna be a lot better paul are you
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:25.820]  there yeah i'm here have you had a chance to see either one of the films i'm actually going to see
[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:32.300]  the superman film tomorrow morning so i'm looking forward to that okay now paul i know you had a lot
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:36.540]  of different things you want to talk about and i don't want to spoil the movie for you but alex
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:44.860]  already said it so there is a eugenics aspect to the film where they have planned bursts and so
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:49.980]  forth so it's all the propaganda coming in there you know and guys like gorier who wrote i guess
[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:54.860]  co-wrote superman he also wrote or at least co-wrote the dark knight the batman movies and
[02:44:54.860 --> 02:45:00.220]  also the video game black ops so the guys are definitely well informed well involved in what's
[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:05.820]  going on in the world well precisely i mean they're on the cutting edge aren't they alex
[02:45:05.820 --> 02:45:12.540]  also mentioned the film elizium which is you know the upcoming dystopic matt damon film and in that
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:18.220]  humanity separates into two new class systems those who get the cybernetic upgrades they go
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:24.060]  and live on an off-planet habitat and then the rest of humanity is consigned to a dying earth
[02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:29.580]  you know overpopulated lack of food lack of sanitation so this this theme runs through a
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:34.380]  lot of hollywood blockbusters at the moment because it's also on the cutting edge of science
[02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:40.780]  with uh you know people like ray kerswell talking about it which we can move on to now sure well
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:48.060]  there was this this global futures 2045 conference last weekend in new york ray kerswell who of course
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:53.740]  is an inventor futurist we spoke about him on the show many times before he gave another speech in
[02:45:53.740 --> 02:46:01.260]  which he basically re-outlined what he first set forth in his book the age of spiritual machines
[02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:08.540]  now for people who haven't read the book it was written in 1999 he basically predicted almost
[02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:17.740]  every technological development from 1999 to 2009 the ipod netflix the kindle everything that we now
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:23.500]  use and take for granted which was unheard of in 1999 he predicted it so he's got a quite accurate
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:31.820]  track record which is interesting because by 2029 if you read his book he predicts that humans will
[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:39.100]  have cybernetically augmented their bodies they're going to have brain interfaces chips augmentations
[02:46:39.100 --> 02:46:44.140]  that allow them to be smarter have greater memories be more immune from disease and so on
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:49.820]  but what kerswell doesn't admit in his speeches such as the one that happened last weekend
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:54.700]  is the fact that this kind of technology is not going to be available for all of us it's going to
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:47:01.660]  be available for a super elite that uses it to dominate and enslave the rest of the population
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:07.500]  and he actually admits that in his own book here's a quote people involved in unskilled labor will
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:13.180]  become super superfluous when their jobs are replaced by machines and there is almost no human
[02:47:13.180 --> 02:47:17.980]  employment in production agriculture and transportation so the machines are going to come
[02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:24.780]  in to replace the workers the unskilled labor and then people who either refuse or are incapable of
[02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:31.820]  getting the cybernetic implants the cyborg upgrades this is what he said about them quote humans who
[02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:39.180]  do not utilize such implants are unable to meaningfully participate in dialogues with those
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:44.780]  who do so he's basically saying if you don't get the brain chip if you don't get the cybernetic
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:49.420]  upgrade which is going to be consigned to the elite because most of us won't be able to afford
[02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:55.020]  it right or if we reject it and you know get called neo luddites then we're not going to be
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:48:00.220]  meaningfully engaged in society we're not going to be able to have dialogues with other people
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:04.940]  which is kind of like what the modern cell phone is if you don't have a cell phone then you're
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:09.580]  seen as somehow backward and you can't communicate with people it's going to be that to an even
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:16.300]  greater level but i think more people will resist the cybernetic implants the upgrades and it's
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:22.460]  going to create this this clash of two classes where the elite goes off and has all these upgrades
[02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:28.220]  life extension technologies while the rest of us are left to suffer in you know the cry freedom
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:33.660]  ghetto as it once was described and this is not just no just to interrupt you briefly paul and we
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:37.980]  get back to courage well but we see this uh recently with the xbox uh i don't want to call
[02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:42.940]  it a scandal but the xbox xbox one the next generation where they said that they were going
[02:48:42.940 --> 02:48:47.740]  to have to have it plugged into the uh the internet 24 hours a day and it had uh the retina
[02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:52.380]  scanning the thing was so advanced you could tell if you were enjoying the game and we had one of
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:56.700]  the publishers i believe it was for the uh one of the game companies came out he said well if you
[02:48:56.700 --> 02:49:01.500]  don't like your xbox being on 24 hours a day and all your information being gathered well you can
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:06.540]  just stay with the xbox 360 and enough people said well we'll just stay with the xbox 360
[02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:11.820]  that microsoft came was no no no no to go out and buy the xbox one so we see when people rise up and
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:17.500]  they say we don't want this technology that can actually have a meaningful impact well precisely
[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:21.820]  i mean you don't have to go along with it what they're trying to bring in is the internet of
[02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:27.820]  things where slavery is sold as convenience i mean this is what patreus talks about when he said
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:33.100]  you know it's the new cutting edge of clandestine statecraft they don't need to wiretap anyone if
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:38.460]  every device in your home is on the internet is sending messages about you is recording you
[02:49:38.460 --> 02:49:47.020]  as with the xbox exactly not immediate interrupt paul go ahead well yeah that's that's basically
[02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:52.460]  what this is all heading towards is being even more plugged into the matrix and those who aren't
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:58.220]  are ostracized from society i mean you read the book and it's quite frankly bizarre by the end of
[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:03.900]  the book one of the characters in it who he has a dialogue with has merged with her computer hive
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:11.180]  mind lover and is having sex with herself in virtual reality that's in spiritual machines
[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:19.420]  yeah it's crazy okay i'll start go ahead go ahead it's absolutely crazy she dumps this character
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:25.500]  molly dumps her husband and actually goes off and fornicates with this computer hive mind and then
[02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:32.540]  by the end of the book kerswell wants to get in on the fun as well so this is a very there is a
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:37.660]  real story about some i guess they do this in japan where you can marry like a video game
[02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:43.580]  character or like a cartoon character and there's this guy he married a cartoon character and he had
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:48.620]  it on his little iphone or whatever he was like yeah this is my wife susie and i don't know how
[02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:54.060]  they fornicate or i guess they're married so they don't fornicate uh but that's we'll talk about all
[02:50:54.060 --> 02:51:02.860]  that and a whole lot more on the other side with paul joseph watson hi my name is annette and due
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:07.980]  to menopause symptoms for nearly two years i suffered severe hot flashes which prevented
[02:51:07.980 --> 02:51:12.780]  me from sleeping all night it was so hard to work because i continued all day to have the
[02:51:12.780 --> 02:51:19.420]  hot flashes from hell i was exhausted and depleted after only three weeks on one world way i have no
[02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:25.660]  hot flashes and i'm sleeping normally again i feel energized and strong this is an amazing product
[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:29.900]  it is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10 of its
[02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:35.980]  protein content as glutathione but due to toxicity and aging it does not could glutathione be a
[02:51:35.980 --> 02:51:40.460]  missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body if you restore the optimal
[02:51:40.460 --> 02:51:44.780]  glutathione levels in your cells especially your glands and organs then as a result your
[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:49.900]  glands and organs work better imagine the quality of life improvement you might have to order one

[02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:13.660]  storms 24 hours before a storm strikes people panic it would be wise to prepare ahead of the
[02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:19.740]  panic curve the food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous

[02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:17.020]  welcome back to the alex jones radio show jakari jackson and paul jillson watson filling in
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:20.780]  now paul i know you have a lot of information to go about and this is the last segment some step
[02:54:20.780 --> 02:54:25.420]  back give you the reins and go over all your information well yeah we were talking about
[02:54:25.420 --> 02:54:32.380]  ray kerswell and his recent prediction again that by 2045 humans will upload their minds
[02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:37.580]  into computers and then in the decades following we will basically dispense with the body all
[02:54:37.580 --> 02:54:44.620]  together we will become virtual reality avatars basically to me that means a complete spiritual
[02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:49.900]  holocaust you can't survive the spirit can't survive in a computer program but that's what
[02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:54.780]  he's predicting and he's been very accurate with his past predictions as i said before the break
[02:54:55.980 --> 02:55:02.140]  i would question his sanity by the fact that he has a dialogue with this character called molly
[02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:07.740]  in his book who is living through the different time periods which he forecasts up to 2099 and
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:14.460]  by the end of it molly has dumped her husband she's merged with a hive mind computer program
[02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:22.940]  called george she has virtual reality sex with this computer program and basically the original
[02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:28.780]  molly her body has been dispensed with they all merge together and then by the end of it kerswell
[02:55:28.780 --> 02:55:36.540]  himself gets in on the act it's completely bizarre but people give this guy credence because he's had
[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:43.980]  accurate predictions what's frightening about it is those humans who resist this cybernetic upgrade
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:50.540]  this merging into the matrix becoming a virtual reality avatar you know uploading your mind to
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:55.980]  a computer and remember kerswell is one of the key directors at google this is not some ranting
[02:55:55.980 --> 02:56:04.060]  lunatic he's got a position of power now um they quote in this book kerswell quotes ted kaczynski
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:09.740]  the unibomber and he's also quoted by bill joy in in the wired magazine article why the future
[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:14.700]  doesn't need us and they give him credence despite the fact that he was a terrorist because he
[02:56:14.700 --> 02:56:22.380]  outlined succinctly the dangers posed by this future that kerswell and others are predicting
[02:56:23.020 --> 02:56:28.140]  and this is the quote due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the
[02:56:28.140 --> 02:56:34.940]  masses and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous a useless
[02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:41.180]  burden on the system if the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass
[02:56:41.180 --> 02:56:47.420]  of humanity if they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological
[02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:54.940]  techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct leaving the world to
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:57:03.340]  the elite that's what ted kaczynski wrote that's what kerswell quotes in his own book as either
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:09.340]  either one of those two likely outcomes as a result of this new class system being created
[02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:14.460]  by the elite having having access to the life extension technologies of cybernetic upgrades
[02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:20.060]  so they're basically saying once the elite are in that position of total technological dominance
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:26.060]  we will be superfluous if we don't adopt the same thing it will be kept from us to begin with most
[02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:31.980]  people won't be able to do it so we'll either be sterilized and go out of existence or they'll just
[02:57:31.980 --> 02:57:38.300]  slaughter us straight off the bat so that's what the futurists are predicting for humanity i for
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:45.180]  one have no interest in seeing that as the future of the human race but a lot of influential elitist
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:52.220]  futurists like ray kerswell do yeah it's a it's a very scary thing it's a very creepy thing you know
[02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:58.060]  it reminds me of that statue you guys saw at bilderberg that weird uh half terminator looking
[02:57:58.060 --> 02:58:02.780]  thing climbing out of the ooze and and that's really what they want and it sounds so sci-fi
[02:58:02.780 --> 02:58:07.740]  to anybody you know who's new to this information but this is very much what they want briefly paul
[02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:15.820]  give me your your thoughts on google glass well again google glass was predicted by kerswell
[02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:21.260]  in this book in 1999 eventually obviously it's going to be embedded in the eye it's going to be
[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:27.420]  a contact lens as well but that is part of this transhumanist move towards cybernetic upgrades
[02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:32.220]  the good news is that businesses across america are already banning it because it's basically
[02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:36.780]  we're close to the close to the end but i do agree with you on that info wars nightly news
[02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:40.380]  tonight 7 p.m central i'll be hosting gg r net it will be in studio with me
[02:58:40.380 --> 02:58:56.140]  thank you for listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
