[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  There are problems in our country, yes we live in troubled times, there are far too many
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  criminals and far too many crimes, unlocking every window and upvoting every door.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  The tool I use in self defense will even up the score.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  You can rape, you can rape, you can make your demands and you can take my gun from my cold dead hands.
[00:38.000 --> 00:56.000]  There are global corporations, they have billions that they pay, true degree politicians who make sure things go their way, they tax us into the poverty and we live from day to day.
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  To them we're useless eaters, we don't get to have a say, you wanna crack this constitution, is that what's in your plan?
[01:04.000 --> 01:15.000]  You can take my gun from my cold dead hand, in every case through history, when genocide was planned, the firearms were gathered up and the opposition banned.
[01:15.000 --> 01:25.000]  The tyrants made distractions and the people looked away and by the time they realized they couldn't get away, the smiling face on my TV says
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  we should all join hands and help create this vision of a new world order plan.
[01:30.000 --> 01:41.000]  We'll downsize our defenses, give our bases all the way to a UN global peace force and we'll do just what they say, take your globalist agenda and your new world order.
[01:41.000 --> 01:56.000]  You can take my gun from my cold dead hand.
[01:56.000 --> 02:18.000]  It's a movement of the economic elite to create levers of control for societies through large centralized governments, it is not a movement of the downtrodden masses and it's well proven, anybody that knows history, that international bankers financed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia,
[02:18.000 --> 02:34.000]  they created and tried to murder the prince of the Austrian Hungarian Empire and actually succeeded to create World War I and that's how they create their power is through destroying societies so that they can come out on top.
[02:34.000 --> 02:47.000]  That's basically called despotic leadership my friends and what we're gonna talk about is a local issue about Roland Ellingson being given $2,000 a day fines for having three inch grass
[02:47.000 --> 02:56.000]  and then you'll see the hypocrisy of a city council member who goes along with this type of absolutely fascist behavior, command and control behavior, fascist comments, it's all the same
[02:56.000 --> 03:10.000]  and what you're about to see will shock and anger you to see the hypocrisy, you'll also see the health department engaged in just absolutely hypocritical and ridiculous behavior
[03:10.000 --> 03:24.000]  and this is only on a local level, internationally they have the so called environmentalist laws where they're gonna move all our production to third world nations that have no environmental controls and I assure you that's not going to help the environment,
[03:24.000 --> 03:34.000]  that is going to hurt the environment. So it's not about the environment, it's not about keeping your neighborhoods good and safe like the statesman said, it's about controlling civilizations,
[03:34.000 --> 03:49.000]  it's about deindustrializing the US and transferring all modes of production to third world nations with absolutely no human rights, no environmental controls with the bankers and the IMF, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank of Settlements have absolute control and domination.
[03:49.000 --> 04:07.000]  Now let me just preface this folks, I'm gonna briefly, first off, I've got a Webster's dictionary, this is straight out of Webster's, this is not theory, this is out of Webster's dictionary, there was a system in place between the 9th and 15th century called feudalism
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  and I believe folks if you really take a hard look at it, you will find that this is very similar to the property taxes of today.
[04:15.000 --> 04:23.000]  Communism is the new pseudo-political term for feudalism to get us all off track and argue about it, it's slavery basically.
[04:23.000 --> 04:37.000]  Let me just read what feudalism is according to Webster's dictionary. A political and economic system of Europe from the 9th to the 15th century and we're going to put it up on a TV here for you to look at.
[04:37.000 --> 04:47.000]  Based on the relation of Lord to Vassal as a result of land being held on condition of homage and service.
[04:47.000 --> 04:57.000]  Now basically if we ever get to, maybe we're not going to get to, but that's basically what it means to, and I want to just also while they're working on that, I want to read to you.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Some of the planks of communist communists.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  Here in America today we Americans pride ourselves as being supposedly staunch anti-communist.
[05:07.000 --> 05:18.000]  Communism is a way of life that is contrary to most teachings of the Bible and that of common law as our beloved country was founded on.
[05:18.000 --> 05:38.000]  In 1848 Carl Marx wrote the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto which he copied from an article written by Zionist and Illuminati founder Adam Wisehop in 1787.
[05:38.000 --> 05:49.000]  Now this is the feudalism from Webster's dictionary. You can see that that's very, like I say, this is basically you don't own your land, it's an illusion of ownership.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  You're actually running your land that you believe you own.
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  And you know, Jeff, if we were all ants and bees this would work just fine.
[05:57.000 --> 06:06.000]  The problem is in one of these systems corrupt individuals always foster this system so that they can have an excuse politically to control your destiny and your life.
[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  And remember, again, communism is a movement of economic elite not of the downtrodden masses.
[06:12.000 --> 06:22.000]  The first plank of Carl Marx's Communist Manifesto is the abolition of private property and application in the hands of the state.
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  Basically it reads here as in the old law of Moses and in the first 150 years of America.
[06:28.000 --> 06:37.000]  Remember, this wasn't always here. When you own your land you had absolute title to the land and no other party can lay claim to it.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  A person's home is their castle.
[06:39.000 --> 06:47.000]  Right. Today we have what we call a 99 year lease. The state can confiscate your land for non-payment of taxes.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  So this is plank one of the Communist Manifesto.
[06:50.000 --> 07:02.000]  This is plank two. We're going to begin in the more of that. This also deals with permits, land fees, having your land declared a floodplain.
[07:02.000 --> 07:19.000]  Now, Jeff, let me just mention floodplains, property taxes, permits, all the UN takeovers, all the different ways that the government or some form of government is controlling your property.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  Go ahead, Alex.
[07:20.000 --> 07:30.000]  Well, I just want to say that this is a local manifestation of what we're seeing under the guise of environment.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  And it has nothing to do with the environment. It has everything to do with revenue generation.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  Right.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  And the key term in all of that.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  Yes, yes. And the secret to the whole thing of it is that taxes ought to be on what you consume, like a sales tax or something like that.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  They should not be on your home.
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  Before, let me just mention, before 1913, the national government was founded strictly on tariffs and trade.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Yes.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  Most people have no conception of that.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  Well, that's how every other successful country runs their trade. And it creates thriving economies.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  Now we're a huge debtor nation because of the income tax and the unelected, unaccountable IRS.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  There's no innocent or proven guilty. There's no due process.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  Something very simple like due process with the IRS. That just doesn't exist.
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  And we're going to get into that. Well, before you do that, let me just read this because you led right into plank number two.
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  Second plank of Karl Marx Communist Manifesto, a heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.000]  We all know that we have an income tax in America and the more you make, the more you are taxed.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  The income tax on the working individual was instituted in 1942 by the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  Mr. Birdsley Rummel, with a backing of FDR.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  Now I want to back up for a second. People probably heard that the more you make, the more you pay.
[08:50.000 --> 08:58.000]  That's up to about 200, 300 grand. If you're a Rockefeller or a DuPont, you got to be in these super trusts.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  They got knocked out about 1903. They got to grandfather their trust to where they get to keep all their wealth,
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  put them into trust and foundations, and then their wealth only grows.
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  In fact, when a Rockefeller dies, they die worth nothing. Their wealth goes to their family.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  When a normal person dies with $100,000 in a home, the state gets about half of it.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  Plus, many of these people have hidden assets in Swiss banks and all this, which we will never know.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  That's why they never show up on the fours.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  Yeah, the fours, 10 most wealthy individuals, because their assets are hidden.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  Yeah, if you believe Bill Gates is worth $26 billion, is the richest man in the world.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  You've got some ice cream to sell people in the North Pole.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  Exactly.
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.000]  Okay, now plank number three, folks. The third plank. The abolition of all right of inheritance.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Actually, I got some mining stuff.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  Okay. The abolition of all right of inheritance.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  Now, this is the old law of Moses.
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  That's not for them.
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  The old law of Moses, in the first 150 years of America, there was no inheritance tax.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  In the law of Moses, land was transferred to the eldest son, absolutely.
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  In the first 150 years in America, inheritance and your assigns was also absolute.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  There was no third parties involved.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  The marriage license makes the state a third party to the marriage.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  If you are an alien, you cannot have right of descent.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  Thus, the state has an interest which must be paid when one dies.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  Mike tells us what we've got to go to the video.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  If I can just do a quick recap of what you're about to see.
[10:43.000 --> 10:53.000]  This was the big talk for several months from KLBJ to KVET to my radio program on 989 KJFK.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  There was a lot of discussion of this.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  It's very important.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  This is absolute feudalism.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  This is local land grab.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  I understand.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  I want you to explain this.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  I'm still going to get through these quickly.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  I won't read all the deals here.
[11:06.000 --> 11:14.000]  The fourth plank of the Communist Manifesto, the confiscation of property of all immigrants and rebels.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  This tape will illustrate this.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  Some people swat teams, businesses are closed, homes are closed.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  We're actually seeing...
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  Now, number five, Communist Manifesto.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  We're going to need a close-up of this.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  This is who makes sure you pay right here.
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  That's who makes sure...
[11:36.000 --> 11:45.000]  Now, number five, centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and exclusive...
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  Remember, these are controlled by the trans-nationals who are bigger than any one country.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  Right.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  But right here, folks, is a good example.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  If you're for communism, you're for the ultra-corrupt rich.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  Let me do this.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  Right there, if we can get a real good...
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  Can you focus in on that?
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  This is where your tax dollars go.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  Right there it is.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  That's your national bank here in America.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  Tell us a little just briefly about that.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  Well, it's a gigantic money trust established in 1913, and for their full slavery to be enforced now for 84 years,
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  they have to totally destroy private property under the guise of environmentalism or this or that.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  Okay, let me go to plank number six.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  I'm going to get through these planks, even if we have to cut out some of this later stuff.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  Okay, number six, the centralization of the means of communication and transportation in the hands of the state.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  That's part of the...
[12:34.000 --> 12:43.000]  Now, this is accomplished by the Federal Communications Commission, which controls, regulates, and licenses all newspapers, magazines, radio, and television stations...
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000] ...who are in local...
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000] ...transportation is controlled through the use of state vehicle registration and licensing of the owner.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  And now they want to thumb scan you?
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  They've been doing it since 1993, and now Clinton wants urine and blood testing for everyone to get life.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  That's all loving.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Plank number seven of the Communist Manifesto.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  The extension of factories and the instruments of production owned by the state,
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  and the bringing into cultivation of land and the improvement of soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  That's the UN land grab and control...
[13:14.000 --> 13:15.000]  That's it.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000] ...and the guise of its total control of society.
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  Well, let me just mention this.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  The factories are controlled...
[13:19.000 --> 13:29.000]  Okay, this various agencies that control this are OSHA, labor boards, unions, smaller businesses,
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  and there are extensions of these factories because they are franchises.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  So, some of the various governmental agencies like the Soil Conservation District, Bureau of Land Management,
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  Desert Land Entry Act, where government-owned land is leased to corporate farmers...
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  And now with HR 901, Executive Order 12,986, this is trying to counter that.
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  It makes the UN a super government over our controls.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  And this is happening, and anyone that denies it is just an absolute idiot.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Eighth plank.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  I'm going to get through them.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  Equal liability for all to labor and the establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  Equal liabilities established through social security and forcing women to work to support the family
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  as men cannot earn enough to support the family due to the debt-usery money system.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  Most are members of the industrial...
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  And then the children have to be educated by the state and be prosecuted to the state.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  Right. Most are members of an industrial army through this number because you cannot get a job without the number.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  This is your social security number and other things like this.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  Thumb scanning.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  This would also involve certain labor...
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  Get number nine and ten.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  Well, let me just mention.
[14:38.000 --> 14:46.000]  Probably things like affirmative action, forcing employers to hire certain people.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  All of these types of things.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  Number nine, the combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  and the gradual abolition of the distribution of population over the country.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Regional government.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  And this is the explanation for regional government under control of the federal government
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  who are under the direct control of foreign bankers.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  In other words, one world government.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  That's number nine.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  The last is free education.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  Now, number nine, I don't need to explain this.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  And it's not free.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  Tenth plank of the communist education.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  That's true.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  Free education for all children in public schools.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  Government training and indoctrination centers.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  Even private and church schools must obtain a license and teach a state-approved courses.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  Jeff, we've got to go to this video.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  I just want to read this real quick.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  Teach all humanistic principles, not reading and writing the mathematics.
[15:35.000 --> 15:42.000]  They are taught to be good slaves to the government and ask for a license permission before doing anything.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  With that, folks, go ahead and explain the story you're about to see.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  Big time on all the talk radio.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  Huge story.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  The statesman actually counted our piece and attacked it and said it was for the kids
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  and to keep us from crying.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  Three inch grass.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  He was given $2,000 a day fines.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  He's going to court this month.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  Total hypocrisy.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  You're going to see the hypocrisy with city council members and the actual health department
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  that issued the $2,000 a day fines.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  Let me just mention this quickly.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  I want to just read it because this is very significant.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  10th Plaint Communist Manifesto.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  Free public education, like you said, which isn't free.
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  In fact, sixth and seventh graders are taught to fill out income tax forms by the IRS.
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  They are taught that the government will support them if they do what they are told and do
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  not ask questions.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  Yeah, don't ask questions.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  That's bad.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Okay, let's go to the video.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  Here we are at a council member's house, home.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  Here we are at a council member's house, home down here in Austin.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  I'm not going to tell you their address or who they are, but you ought to see how overgrown
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  their house is.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  Very nice little neighborhood over there.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  I will tell you.
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  But it's just crazy that we'll just wait until you see how overgrown it is.
[17:03.000 --> 17:04.000]  Hell, look at that house.
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  That's more overgrown.
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  Look, that's not the council member's house, but look, that's more overgrown than Mr.
[17:09.000 --> 17:10.000]  Ellingsons.
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  It's crazy.
[17:11.000 --> 17:18.000]  I think it makes me the maddest is how the paper countered with that story.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  We came out and did a story about Mr. Ellingsons being harassed by the health department and
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  environmental services.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  And two days later, there was a front page thing on the health department saying how wonderful
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  they are, stopping crime, sewage, and helping the children in East Austin.
[17:34.000 --> 17:41.000]  Everything health department did it.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  Here we are, folks.
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  The right wing evil.
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  Look at it.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  This is a council member.
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  Now, we should probably slap up some footage later of Mr. Ellingsons and show you that this
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  is 10 times more overgrown than his property.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  Selective enforcement.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  Selective enforcement.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  And we're not attacking this council member.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  We're just saying, hey, maybe they should know about the hypocrisy and the city that
[18:03.000 --> 18:11.000]  they run, that we've elected them to protect us from their own minions.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  Even the driveways overgrown.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  I mean, look at that.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  And folks, the camera can't even catch what's going on in this yard.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.000]  And it's not our business.
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  We don't care.
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  I don't think it's a problem.
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  But the statesman does.
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.000]  The health department does.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  They agree $2,000 a day fines for non-compliance.
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  Better take their home.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  Better bulldoze it.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  Out of control.
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  Out of control.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  It's best.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  Absolutely.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  Out of control.
[18:35.000 --> 18:44.000]  You got to go up there.
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  Well, anyways, we went out there and what, I mean, I don't know how to explain it.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  You should have seen it with your own eyes.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  The council member owns two houses on that street.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  The one you're looking at right now is supposedly where the neighbors told us she lived.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  And that's where the hot tip told us she lived.
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  And then we checked it out.
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  And that is where the council member lives.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  And we asked five different neighbors.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  They all said, yes, the council member lives there.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  Then they pointed us to the rent property across the street.
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  I don't mean to laugh, but it looks like you'd see a great McCaw parrot or something flying through or Tarzan.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's unbelievable.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  Totally overgrown.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  You can't even see the front door.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  And it's a nice neighborhood.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  You can see the neighborhood there.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  I mean, she definitely has the worst properties in that neighborhood.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  We drove around a few streets and we were just, it was just unbelievable.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  It seems like bureaucrats are all the same.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  I mean, they'll tell us how to do everything.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  When you go look at them, they're slobs.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  And I'm not knocking a zero escape yard.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  But in a few minutes we'll show you Ellington's property.
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  The guy that got the, you know, the threatened, they threatened him for $2,000 a day fines.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  Now look at that.
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  She owns that property.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  That's the rent house across the street.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  Holes on the roof.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  They have a tarp over it.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  You can't see how the woods were rotting.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  And I wish we would have got a bigger camera shot of the entire property.
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  It's, you, there must be a little trail of the door.
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  It's unbelievable.
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  And you'll probably see me laughing and making a joke at it right here.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  But I mean, and I'm saying leave her alone.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.000]  Leave the council member alone.
[20:12.000 --> 20:17.000]  But if this doesn't make us act, if this doesn't make us, there's her actual property where she lives.
[20:17.000 --> 20:20.000]  And the camera just does not catch it.
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  Unbelievable.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  And the air was just swimming with mosquitoes.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  I was being bit on the head and on the back of my neck and on my hands.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  And I was over at Mr. Ellington's house for about an hour and a half talking to him.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Last week we first did a story.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  There was nothing.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  There was no bugs.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  He had healthy cats.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  Didn't see him scratching.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  Had a beagle dog.
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  He's an old retired, semi-retired arborist.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  I mean, so, you know, I try to make jokes out of it and make it where we can handle it.
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  But really it's scary.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  And then to see the auspricate statesman, you know, two days after we did the story Monday on Thursday,
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  you know, we did it Monday night, so really that's two business days,
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  come out with a front page story on the cover saying,
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  Toll weeds cause crime, you know, East Austin, all these buzz words.
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  No, it's $2,000 a day, folks.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  They love it.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  They're making tons of money out of this.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Squeezing people in environmental services.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  I'll tell you the truth.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  It's not good for the environment to, and there's one of the vehicles that's parked there.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  You might want to, and you can guess who the council member is.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  We're allowed to say who the council member is, but I'm not going to get into that game.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  But again, there's the rental property across the street, the neighbors told us,
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  and the other property is where she lives.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  And again, they have a rotting roof.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  Why, that's a health hazard.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  Standing water, just like the, there was lots of standing water,
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  just like the letter that Mr. Ellington got said,
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  move objectionable material, well, what's that? I don't know, whatever they want it to be, I guess.
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  But we'll show you some cuts of Mr. Ellington's property.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  Now, this is a normal, what most of the houses look like in the neighborhood.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  And then there's her yard next door to one of the other houses.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  So there's one of your council members, again, folks,
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  showing us how to run things, broken down vehicles.
[22:06.000 --> 22:13.000]  We didn't want to get on her property, but you could see the vines were wrapped around the antenna on the vehicle.
[22:13.000 --> 22:23.000]  And anyways, I don't know, you just, and again, don't you attack me, Alex Jones,
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  for what I'm sitting here doing.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  I'm not trying to cause a bunch of trouble for this person.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  I'm saying they're running RC and they're going around harassing people.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  And then they're just hypocrisy, man, Ellington.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  And then people called the show last week and called my radio show too and said,
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  oh, you know, we got to cut that grass.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  It's for, you know, hurting, crime, bugs, breeding.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  And I'm like, he had three inch grass.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Oh, the city wouldn't do it unless it was needed.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  Well, all right then, if Ellington's land's bad,
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  then get over their city and put leans against her.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  $2,000 a day.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  Their own, well, last Thursday's Oscar Statesman had it in there.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  $2,000 a day is needed.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  It's important to keep us safe.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  Yeah, safe from what, you know?
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  I don't know, I'm not going to ramble anymore.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  Here's Mr. Ellington's house. Check this out.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  And see the difference between her properties and the council member's properties
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  and his property where he's lived since 1947.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  Here's his property there and he did nothing to it.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  That's exactly how it was.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  I drove by three or four days before we did the story and saw it.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  And the grass was uncut, unwatered.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  It was like three inches high and had dead spots in it,
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  like any other, you know, place with a lot of trees.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  And the place was well painted, nice indoors.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  I didn't see a tarp on the roof or anything,
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  a danger to any children or anything.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  And the house you see in front is where he has some renters,
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  some nice English guys who are artists who live over here.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  And then you can see Mr. Ellington,
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  the older gentleman's arborist worksheet.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  And there's some of his evil right-wing cats.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Those are actually his cats and he's got a dog.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  Oh, he's also got a parrot back in his two-story little house in the back,
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  lived there since 47.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  He actually built those houses himself.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  His wife died.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  So that's what's going on.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  Actually, his wife died.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  So we got out of that house a long time ago and ran into it kind of sad to live there.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  And you can just see the problems that he's been causing.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  It's obvious that he's bad.
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  And there's the arborist, a little trailer.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  They give him a little bit of trouble about keeping that there.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  Maybe he was just like Goodman and became a, I'm sorry,
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  maybe if he was just like some of the people in government around town,
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  nothing would happen to him.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  Maybe he would just be left alone.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  I don't know.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  Maybe he'd just be left alone if he'd just give up and quit working
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  and not have that bad trailer with some plants in the back,
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  that he has to go pay the landfill to exorbitant prices to dump.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  There's the backyard, just the complete evil.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  You can see some lumber where he does a little bit of carpentry.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  He didn't even straighten up when we came over.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  That's just the way it's been.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  There's the terrible long grass, just the worst thing I've ever seen.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  It was a little bit taller in back.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  It was probably four and a half inches tall in back.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  See, we're not hiding anything.
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  We're showing you the back.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  And those tarps were not put up just because we came out there.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  There were tarps over his lumber for a long time that was holes in the corner of the tarps.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  They had been there so long.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  And there's his vehicle.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  Just a bad man trying to live his life.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  There he is.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  God, he's got to be stopped.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  Oh, man.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  And there we go up front, being bad people, causing trouble, hurting whoever we can.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  And in a few minutes, I'll show you the health department.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  We went out to the health department after we were here.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  And as usual, didn't even go check out before we did the story.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  We went out there to the health department, and it was just in disrepair.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  And there's the letter he got on July 17.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  We were on the story by the 25th and by the 26th.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  And the statesman had countered by the 31st with a story about how, you know, it was all East Austin.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  It was all crime.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  It was all broken sewage, broken sewage.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  Every buzzword they could think of.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  And it showed some couch.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  But there's the little citation threatening leans on his house
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  where he finds $50,000 a day.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  Which they do routinely.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  I'm here with Charles Rowland Ellington.
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  Over here in Central Austin, right off Guadalupe Street.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  And he lives at 407th B, West 37th Street, Austin, Texas, 787-05.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  And thank God people like him are still willing to stand up.
[26:41.000 --> 26:50.000]  When I met Mr. Ellington at a Patriot meeting talking about lower taxes and less government regulation.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  You know, bad things like that.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  And later he faxed me some information that the city is harassing him,
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  the Austin Health and Human Services Travis County Health Department,
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  Environmental Health Services Division.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  They have piles of junk in their backyard.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  And there's nothing but a stack of lumber covered with a tarp.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  This is his private property.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  This is America.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  And I want you to film the grass here.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  There's nothing wrong with this grass.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  It's zero-scape grass.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  That's what the environmentalists beg us to do.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  It's cut.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  It's clean.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  There's no problem.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  It's, you know, it's not some millionaire's home.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  But it's a nice Central Austin home that I would be proud to live in.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  I really like the way these neighborhoods look.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  So that's what we're talking about today.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  We're talking about how there is selective enforcement.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  And then I was shocked to find out that Mr. Ellington, Mr. Charles Rowland Ellington,
[27:50.000 --> 27:58.000]  has in the past gotten onto the city about some of its out-of-control spending
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  and has been an involved citizen.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  And so that's something that I find to be very shocking.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  Mr. Ellington?
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  That thing's done.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  That's done.
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  Ellingson?
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  I really appreciate you having the will to stand up to what they're doing.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  How did this all start?
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  In your opinion, why are they doing this?
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  And if you'll note that the expansion in the blue pages will give you the blues
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  by the volume of increasing phone numbers supplied for city services.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  That means harassment extortion centers.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  That's about the size of the matter.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  So you exercised your constitutional right.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  You've gone to city council.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  You've written letters.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  You've made phone calls.
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.000]  And now you're being singled out and being harassed for no reason.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  That does seem to be, I mean, a cause and effect reason.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  It does seem to be prudent.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  Well, we're not going to invade the privacy of inside your home,
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  but I was just inside there with you.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  It's a very nice place, no big deal, almost like a little country house.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  How long have you lived here?
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  Since May of 1947.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  How dare you, you evil carpet bagger.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  We've got to get you under control.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  Well, as before this city usurpation of micromanagement, the cockroach syndrome.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  The cockroach syndrome of micromanaging all facets of a citizen's life.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  And that's not American.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  That is un-American.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  Well, how dare you be a hard-working arborist and a person that's engaged in others.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  I mean, that's just how dare you.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  A bourgeois member.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  A member of the bourgeoisie.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  That's right.
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  Yeah, you're out of control.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  We've got to stop you.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  We've got to...
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  So, this little loving letter right here, I'll just read part of it.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  Austin Health and Human Services, Travis County Health Department,
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  Environmental Human Services.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  That's gangsters calling themselves service agents.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  15th Waller Street, Austin, Texas, 787-02.
[29:58.000 --> 30:01.000]  If you want to get in touch with them, we'll put up their number during the show.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  You want to call and tell them how much you appreciate them harassing older, hard-working citizens here in town.
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  Their phone number is 469-2015.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  That's 469-2015.
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.000]  And their fax is 469-2030.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  And we'll give that out later.
[30:16.000 --> 30:26.000]  It says, this is an inform you that a condition in violation of ordinance or state law exist on property located at 407 West 37th Street.
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  And you've said, you're a tough guy, you're willing, you don't mind people knowing where you live.
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  If they want to come by and see the evil property that you live on.
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  See, I came by before you, when you first faxed me this.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  And you told me that since then you raked up a few leaves, that's all you've done to straighten up the property.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  And it's still shocking to me, it's your property.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  That's not the argument.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  You should be able to do what you want on your property unless you've signed a homeowners clause.
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  And as far as I know, over here on 37th, there is no homeowners clause, is there?
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  To my knowledge, I don't want to call it one.
[31:00.000 --> 31:07.000]  So the foods you saw at the first was when we went out to a well-known council person that's been re-elected.
[31:07.000 --> 31:15.000]  And they had tarp on the roof, vines, grass everywhere, mosquitoes flying around, 15 times worse than his, Mr. Ellingston's property.
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  Now I'm going to show you the footage that we went and got that Monday of the health department.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  And again, we didn't go check this out at first, we just went right out to the health department and checked it out.
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  And they were worse.
[31:25.000 --> 31:35.000]  So what we found is all these bureaucrats that are out telling us how to live, they're all 10 times worse than the most average home in Central Austin on West 37th.
[31:35.000 --> 31:40.000]  So stay tuned for this and then in a few minutes we'll be back to the main program.
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  Mr. Ellingston, I could see that you've lived here, what, since 1947, you said?
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  May of that year.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  May of 1947.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  And look at these nice trees.
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  It's nice, it's pretty.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  It's real small when I first came.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  Yeah, and then there's pretty English ivy growing here in the trees.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  And you've got a nice shield around your tree over there to keep it healthy.
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.000]  Oh, you're a right winger.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  And I saw your pretty little cats earlier.
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  I could see why the city really, really wants to get its hands on this property like they've done countless others.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  Make a fortune right out of it, perhaps.
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.000]  Oh yeah, or get some rent from a good liberal lawyer.
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  Yes.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  So we were leaving Mr. Ellingston's place.
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  And less than 150 feet from where he lives, right in the middle of the street, some giant potholes.
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  There's some behind us and some in front of us.
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  Let's drive up here back and look at them.
[32:26.000 --> 32:33.000]  See, the city won't even wipe its own nose, but it'll abuse older people in town and force them, terrorize them,
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  and giving them more money for their bureaucrat behavior.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  See, all the money is going for bureaucrat salaries.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  It's not going to actually do the work of the city.
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  Now they have to force us to do everything.
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  Here, let's see the loving pothole.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  Here we are just right down the road again.
[32:49.000 --> 32:55.000]  And look, they're telling him to mow his yard when his grass is three inches high and he hasn't mowed it.
[32:55.000 --> 33:02.000]  When this kind of stuff is going on, about a six-inch deep pothole, and there's more down here.
[33:02.000 --> 33:06.000]  So ask yourselves, what kind of country is this?
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  Well, that's the truth of it.
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.000]  All they do is harass the citizens, push the people around.
[33:11.000 --> 33:15.000]  We're losing more and more of our personal rights, and they're making despotic inroads into private property
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  while at the same time not taking care of the essential services.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  You see, they dangle essential services in front of your head.
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.000]  Oh, you want the potholes filled. Oh, you want the EMS to have radios, don't you?
[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  See, they pay for the essentials last and pay for all their greed and strange bureaucratic behavior first.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  This isn't an attack at your average bureaucrats, government workers.
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  I'm talking about the people that are under the control of our federal government that want to pay homage to them.
[33:42.000 --> 33:50.000]  Here we are at the loving, caring city, Austin Health and Human Services Travis County Health Department.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  Environmental Health Services Division down here on 15 Waller Street.
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  Look at all the weeds over there.
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.000]  Look, it's worse than much, much worse than Mr. Ellingsons ever was.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  Look, that's six inch grass.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  Oh, I'm going to take the city building if it doesn't fix it.
[34:09.000 --> 34:16.000]  Well, I could put a lien against the city building for Mr. Charles Ellingson.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  Oh, and look at that tree. Look at those weeds right here, producer.
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  Oh, my gosh. Oh, this is just the worst. Oh, my gosh.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  Now folks, I know this seems really stupid, doesn't it?
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  What is the big deal about weeds growing? Much less on somebody's private property.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  Oh, yes, the city's being well taken care of.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  Look how nice the city buildings are.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  Hmm, boy. Always built nice. You can always trust government buildings to be built nice.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  Yes, I don't see any flowers growing like there are at Mr. Ellingsons.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  Here we are, 15th Waller Street at the Health Building.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  Yes, this is where little terrorist activities are launched from in abusing the citizens of Austin.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  People that paved their homes, like Mr. Ellingson, who's had his homes, is 1947, owns his home outright.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  They can't stand that. Look at it.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  But it's this power. Look at those bureaucrat notebooks and things up there.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  Think of all the wonderful harassment that goes out of this little mobster building.
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  Words and pictures can't describe. You have to be out there at the health department
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  and just see how run down and messed up it was with trash on the ground
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.000]  and thousands of cigarette butts and weeds growing up everywhere and walls falling down.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  It was just really depressing.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  And again, from council members to the health department that does the citations, $2,000 a day,
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  for not having your grass cut off, it's over three inches.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  It's out of control. It's hypocrisy.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  And something scary about that letter was it said,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  objectionable material.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  Well, I mean, they had trash all over the place and cans laying around the ground
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  and just piles of cigarette butts and disease-looking birds hopping around.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  I mean, that's not, and I don't know what he's faulting them. Why are they faulting, you know?
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  And the paper comes out, we did that story and comes in defending the health department.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  They're shaking people down, man. They're shaking them down.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  Plain and simple.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  Just to recap, there's Ellington's house and there's the council member's house.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  Now, folks, get ready to see one of the most amazing stories in Austin's history.
[36:21.000 --> 36:29.000]  This house right here belongs to Mr. Joe Capana, a veteran of World War II in Korea.
[36:29.000 --> 36:36.000]  The city threatened to bulldoze Mr. Capana's house on a Monday.
[36:36.000 --> 36:43.000]  But we were there on Saturday interviewing some of the neighbors and talking to Mr. Joe Capana.
[36:43.000 --> 36:52.000]  And by Saturday night, Alex was on the radio asking for volunteers to build Mr. Joe Capana a new house on Sunday.
[36:52.000 --> 37:02.000]  Of course, about 60 people from Alex's radio show showed up on 49th Street to build Mr. Joe Capana a new home.
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  Then, thanks to KI News, they were talking about it on Sunday.
[37:09.000 --> 37:18.000]  Then you had hundreds of people and businesses participate in the building of Mr. Joe Capana a new home.
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  This is why I'd like to name this story Miracle on 49th Street.
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  We're here on East 49th Street and we're talking to some of the neighbors of Joe Capana.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  Alex Owen.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  Alex Owen and Aaron Benfield.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  And Aaron Benfield. Thanks for talking to us.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  And we try to talk to some of the other neighbors. I guess they're gone or don't want to speak to us.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  Mr. Capana next door, what type of neighbor has he been in the past?
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.000]  Well, you don't hear from him very much because he keeps to himself, but he's been a pretty good neighbor.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  No complaints from us.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  He's never said anything. He's never calling complaints against us.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  We've always had a couple parties and he's never really done anything about it.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  He's been a really nice neighbor. He definitely keeps to himself, like Alex said.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  Front yard's cut and the house isn't attractive, but it doesn't bother me.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  Well, it's his property and it's better than him being out on the streets, freezing to death, or panhandling,
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  or even worse, you know, engaged in criminal activity.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  Of course. He doesn't bother anybody and I'll see why we should bother him.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  Mr. Benfield, do you have a problem with this gentleman living next door to you?
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  He has lived there since the mid-1950s. Do you think he's causing a problem?
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  No, not at all. I mean, I've only been here for six months, but I've been coming over to this house
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  since this guy's lived here, the other roommate, and that's two, three years,
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  and I've never heard anything bad about this guy. I don't have a problem with him at all.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Why do you think the city's planning to bulldoze his home?
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Because his house is, I guess it appears, ugly to people,
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  and I really think the problem is that the neighbor on the other side is selling his house,
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  and I bet that kind of deflates the price of his house that he wants to sell it for.
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  Just because something looks bad, it's going to make the property next door look, you know, depreciating value,
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  and it's just not right.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  So ruin somebody's life, tear down a veteran, a disabled person's home, just so they can get more cash?
[39:18.000 --> 39:24.000]  Exactly. Somebody fought in a war for this country, and you're going to come and tear his house down,
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  and the country you fought for, that's just ridiculous.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  That's not America.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  No, that doesn't sound...
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  And some neighbors don't want this person to live here.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  They don't want this house here. They find it to be an embarrassment, they say,
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  and, of course, they won't talk to us on camera.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Of course, nobody's volunteered to help him.
[39:43.000 --> 39:50.000]  They'd rather just put him on the street and then spend 10 times the money in welfare to try to take care of him.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  This is what you get for serving your country?
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  Well, Mr. Capana's not here right now, but you can see his home.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  He does have some structural problems, but people do the property values in this area on East 49th,
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  and some of the other homes that are being sold in this area have file complaints with the city,
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  and on Tuesday they're coming out here with bulldozers to destroy this structure.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  Of course, we haven't heard of any churches or organizations that care to help Mr. Capana, a veteran.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  We see these movies like Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  showing you the plight of soldiers in World War II, but no, no, not Mr. Capana.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  They'd rather make him homeless, throw him out, and then let the social welfare net take care of him.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  He'd probably cost 10 times over time what it would cost to simply fix this structure.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  If we can get in touch with Mr. Capana, we will come out here and help shore up his home
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  no matter what the cost right here at the Freedom Report.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  So what do y'all think about Mr. Joe Capana's home here that's going to be torn down Tuesday
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  by the bulldozers?
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  I really think that it's a shame that it seems to be a crime to not be wealthy.
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  I'm sure he's going to make a great parking lot or a great house for Paige Gresset, who knows.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  It's really bad.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  I mean, one thing that people have, I think, kind of lost sight of is that it's his property.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  Simply, it's his. He owns it. He can do what he wants with it, or at least should be able to.
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  I've got some land in Oklahoma, and my grandfather gave it to me because I was the only one.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  He sat me down. He said, don't ever, ever get government's help.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  Don't ever ask for government programs for anything for the land.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  They'll try. Don't.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  Because once they get onto your land, they'll find something that's endangered, or they'll find something that's wrong,
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  and they'll try to get it. And he's seen it happen, you know, a lot of rural land.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  He's seen that happen, and so that's why I gave it to him.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  That's all for loving reasons, of course.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  So y'all think that Mr. Capana should be left alone? We've been trying to talk to him, but he's obviously a...
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  He's scared, probably.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  But what we're trying to find out is we've got some churches and some organizations that are ready.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  The company that I work with on the side of Mountain View Homes.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  We're ready to come in here and fix the house and put a roof on it.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  If the city will just back off.
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.000]  I tell you what, I'd be willing to help, and I'd get some local comics.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  I guarantee you there's people that are ready to help. I mean, you guys are just driving by and wanting to help.
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  So you kind of summed it up in a nutshell, didn't you? It's his property.
[42:37.000 --> 42:45.000]  Well, it's... you know, back in the early history of our country, it seemed more like where, you know,
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  if you own your land, you could do whatever the heck you wanted with it, as long as you didn't bother anybody else.
[42:50.000 --> 42:58.000]  We're here talking to Joe Capana. How long have you lived here, sir, on East 49th Street?
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  Since 1959.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  Since 1959, and you were in World War II and Korea?
[43:03.000 --> 43:04.000]  Yes.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  And you have 100% disability from the government?
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  Yes. Comfortable.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  Now, you say... and I'm glad that you came out to talk to us. I want to thank you for that.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  You're saying that the city's been harassing you for 20 years?
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  Yes, they have. Since 1977, about the matter.
[43:24.000 --> 43:32.000]  And it's here under other, and it had to prove injury before other could be overridden by the city.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  And now they're jurisdiction all that time, and they've been offending constitutional provisions
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  every time they find me about the matter.
[43:39.000 --> 43:45.000]  And now they seized my property. It took it falsely.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  They've seized your property?
[43:47.000 --> 43:53.000]  Oh, yes. My cars and my shielding and everything in the backyard, thousands of dollars worth of equipment,
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  and even the lumber to do...
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  Well, your neighbors told us that you used to have some cars that weren't even in bad shape,
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  had the glass, the tires, everything on them. They said the city came and took everything that you own?
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  Yes. Well, they took everything in the yard now.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  Yes. When did they do this?
[44:08.000 --> 44:15.000]  Well, they should have taken what they caused in the back room when the roof came in, out and repaired it.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  They caused the roof to cave in?
[44:17.000 --> 44:25.000]  Yes. The city built steel, I believe, pulled the eaves off of my house.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  Now he may have had help. It's all in the report I've turned into the city.
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  And here it comes again.
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.000]  The last time we talked to him about this matter, they said we're not going to do that anymore
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  because they knew they were illegal.
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  And the lawyer, the attorney general, the FBI, and several other people,
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  they gave me reference to a call. I called them.
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  Now here it's all happening over again.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  And they said they weren't going to do that anymore.
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  I'm trying to get legal help.
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.000]  The lawyers don't want to come out here. I don't know why. I can't go there.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  I have everything delivered here.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  You don't have a car because they took your cars?
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  It's not a car. This is embarrassing.
[45:16.000 --> 45:25.000]  My crustates are enlarged because I'm 73 years old and I have to urinate frequently and go to the bathroom to have access to it.
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  No, I understand. I understand. That's a common problem.
[45:30.000 --> 45:37.000]  So they've been harassing you for 20 years. You've lived here since 1959 and now they've seized your property
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  by saying that you caused damage to others but nobody else lives here. This is your property.
[45:41.000 --> 45:49.000]  I haven't caused damage to anyone or harmed anyone. I had to prove harm because it's here in the other from County Court.
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  It's over their head. The damage they caused and complaining about, they caused.
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  And if there's any violations of that, they're the cause of the violations, not me.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  But I'm the one that's being punished and made look bad over the matter.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  Now who is the person that sent you the letter who caused the damage?
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.000]  The city council building people.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  Inspectors?
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  Yeah.
[46:14.000 --> 46:23.000]  They're the ones who, I have a whole sea ration box of vertical envelopes from them for the past 20 years.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  Is there any way, over the same matter?
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  Is there any way that you can bring that out and just show us a few of the documents?
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  Sure.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  Let's do that.
[46:31.000 --> 46:40.000]  This is the letters you've gotten over the past 20 years from the city.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  This is incredible. Can I look at some of the earlier ones?
[46:42.000 --> 46:51.000]  You can. Look at all of them.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  They're all about the same.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  This is incredible.
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  This is from the city of Austin, going back 20 years.
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  And you lived here over 20 years before that.
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  I lived here 40 years.
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  40 years.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  And this is your rights in court.
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  And this is the case.
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  Same case.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  There you have it.
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  This particular one goes way back to 86.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  And they're finding you.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  And it's talking about the tickets and the status.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  This is just horrible.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  But you've beaten them every time over 20 years.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  I haven't beaten them.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  There's been four quiddles and four guilties, I think.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  But guilties are invalid.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  They can't stand because of the first quiddle.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  We're going to get with some citizens.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  I assure you we're not just blowing smoke at you.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  We're going to come out here and we're going to fix this to our best ability to keep the elements out since the city tore your roof off.
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  That's fine.
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  Just enough to get the city off my back about it.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  And it'll probably be hard to satisfy them.
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  If you've been fighting it for 20 years and here's the evidence right here, just a mass of letters.
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  In fact, I might get a shot of this going back over 20 years.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  They've obviously got it out for you, sir.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  And so I certainly hope that we can fix this to their specifications.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  But I think that we're going to be able to do that.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  We can prop up those walls from the inside and put a new roof on for you.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  And we'll do the best job we can.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  Okay. Yes, I appreciate that.
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.000]  The city pays me what they owe me.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  I can pay you from that.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  No, we're not taking it down from you, sir.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  Now, what does the city owe you?
[48:35.000 --> 48:43.000]  Well, they owe me the fines they find me plus the interest on them, which would be the true value of the money since.
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  And they did that when I was getting 12% from first Texas, which isn't in business anymore.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  How did they destroy your roof?
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  That's interesting.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  They pulled the eaves off the end of the rafters.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  They must have threw something over.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  They pulled everyone up off, they could pull off.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  Why on earth would the city inspectors come here and pull the eaves off your structure, the corner points?
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.000]  Well, again, you said there must have been bias toward me.
[49:14.000 --> 49:26.000]  Bill Steele says, when I won my car situation and the trailer situation, he pulled the eaves off of my house.
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  And he said, after I get your cars, I'm going to get your trailer.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  And I told him not to push anyone man too far.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  Was this over the telephone?
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  No, this was here in person. He had another lady with him.
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  What's his name one more time, the man that threatened a World War II inco-orean veteran?
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  Bill Steele. He was a building inspector then. I don't know whether he still is or not.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  Bill Steele. Why on earth would a building inspector vandalize your property?
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  Well, now he shouldn't have done that. He should have told me about it so I could have done something about it.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  Oh, excuse me. He trespassed on your private property and tore your eaves off?
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Oh, that's what it adds up to, yes.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  You know, with the airport moving, your property is going to be worth a lot more.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  Well, it is. And I have mental rights and you can't get there with somewhere else.
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.000]  And I own this property. I know it's not in the tornado path. I don't want to move.
[50:19.000 --> 50:26.000]  They tell me that I don't have any place to move to, but I really don't want to move. I want to stay here.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  Sir, don't you worry. You just found the friends you need. We hate government. We hate big government.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  We fight big government. We're going to fix this house. There'll be a bunch of people out here Tuesday.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  The bulldozers try. I'm going to jail. We're going to stop them. We're going to fix this house.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  Most of it. Support the walls by Tuesday. Then we'll put another roof on here for you.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  Well, we talk to your neighbors and most of your neighbors seem to like you.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  Some neighbors wouldn't talk to us, but your next-door neighbors say you're very quiet and never complained about them.
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  That's true. I don't bother anyone. I've never harmed anyone. I don't own business.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  I say hello, you know, and I'm friendly.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  Where were you in World War II? What part of Europe?
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.000]  I was in the European state of operation. I have two invasions to Sherbert, the second one and the fourth one.
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.000]  I could have been killed in the first one. They pulled us out, grabbed me under my arms and lifted me back on the bar.
[51:19.000 --> 51:26.000]  Who were actually involved in D-Day? Well, it wasn't D-Day. Sherberg was after D-Day, but it was along the coast.
[51:26.000 --> 51:36.000]  Sherberg was the last one along the coast. Normandy was first. Lahar, they call it, and Sherberg was the last.
[51:36.000 --> 51:44.000]  It's the whole coastline of France. It was across the channel. It was the D-Day invasion, as when it was, and that's where I was.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  You minded your own business for 40 years here and for 20 years, and here's the evidence right here.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  They've been harassing you. You got destroyed, right.
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  And now they destroyed your roof on purpose. Well, this is just incredible. This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.000]  Sick control freaks out here in our society won't control your life.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  We're going to fix this and show government what real help is.
[52:06.000 --> 52:13.000]  Not destroying a veteran's home who's got 100% disability. It's just sickening activity.
[52:13.000 --> 52:22.000]  Thank you very much, sir. And we'll be out here tomorrow and Monday doing some basic repairs, shirring up the walls and some other things.
[52:22.000 --> 52:33.000]  We may even have to tear out that wall there, but I promise you we will fix it. For those that know me, I assure you, you have Alex Jones' word, we're going to stop the city.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  We'll have to go to jail. Thank you, sir.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  A community pulls together to help build a new life for an Austin War vet.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  Good evening. I'm Lisa Monzo and welcome to Carewitness News Weekend.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  A World War II in Korea veteran may lose his home of 40 years come Monday.
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.000]  The city of Austin plans to tear it down because Joe Campana's central Austin house is falling down.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  Julie Gershaw shows us that because of our story last night, he may be getting some help.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  I'll turn it inside with anxiety about the matter.
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.000]  In fact, war veteran Joe Campana has been so upset lately, he drinks Pepto Bismol right from the bottle.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  I don't want to move.
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  But the city of Austin says he must and notified him they will bulldoze his home Monday.
[53:17.000 --> 53:30.000]  Because I haven't done any harm to anyone and it's not my negligence. I'm doing my best to manage and it's about all I can do is to go on the way I'm going on.
[53:30.000 --> 53:37.000]  We first told you about Campana's Flight Friday. Some viewers were so upset when they saw our story, they decided to help.
[53:37.000 --> 53:44.000]  If this house is unsafe, we need to make it safe and I'm going to donate materials and employees to do it.
[53:44.000 --> 53:49.000]  Mountain View Homes, a building company, checked out the house. They decided it couldn't be saved.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  Instead, they will build him a new two-room home on the same land.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  We need churches. We need volunteers. I'm going to donate all my employees.
[53:58.000 --> 54:06.000]  At first, Campana was skeptical. Is that a scheme or a catch? How can they do that?
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  My grandson says his help is for real.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  My grandfather fought in World War II. I'm a veteran myself. I want to help this man.
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  All Joe Campana wants is to keep calling 618 East 49th Street home.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  With your eye on Austin, I'm Julie Garcia.
[54:22.000 --> 54:32.000]  An owner with Mountain View Homes admits they will be violating city permit regulations, but he says giving Campana a home before the bulldozers show up is much more important.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Good evening. I'm Lisa Monzo and welcome to Carewitness News Weekend.
[54:35.000 --> 54:40.000]  Joe Campana's house was about to be torn down and he could not do anything but watch.
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.000]  Some Austinites who saw Campana's story stepped in and tonight, the war veteran has new hope for his future.
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  Julie Garcia has the story of strangers reaching out to help an elderly man in need.
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.000]  Because it's the right thing to do. Sold on the news last night, figured they needed some help.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  Essentially having a house raising party.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  They came out in force to drive home their point.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Don't want the guy to be homeless.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  Their efforts brought tears to this World War II veteran's eyes.
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  Man, I need to show tears, but it almost leaves me with tears.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  That's what new people care.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  Two nights ago, Kay, I told you how Joe Campana would lose his home to city bulldozers.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  By Sunday...
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  It's incredible. The appliances have been donated. I mean, we have walls going up.
[55:33.000 --> 55:43.000]  Most of the people out here rarely pick up a hammer and nail, but Joe Campana's story brought out at least 50 volunteers to make sure he has a roof over his head.
[55:43.000 --> 55:50.000]  It encouraged me and gave me hope and courage. And it's moved me.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  The roof he lives under now is about to fall down.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  And the city has deemed the old house unsafe with demolition scheduled for Tuesday.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  This is a poor plan for the new house.
[56:01.000 --> 56:07.000]  But with some luck and a few more donations, there'll be a new house waiting for Joe Campana.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'd like to thank you for making this free.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  A man who many feel deserves the gratitude of all Americans.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  I see it kind of just as a no-fashion barn raising. I'm eternally grateful.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  And Austin Man accepts help before his walls come tumbling down.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  Good evening. I'm Neil Spelz, Christie Fletcher's off tonight.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  You know, this was supposed to be an Austin Man's last night in his home of 40 years.
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  The city planned to bulldoze Joe Campana's house because it was falling down.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  But after our stories of the past few days, some Austin volunteers stepped in.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  And K.I.'s Pamela Cathy-Ones is going to show you what happened next.
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.000]  Dozens of complete strangers, hammers, saw and drill in his front yard.
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.000]  Joe Campana is the disabled veteran K.I. showed you Friday.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  He lives in a home where walls cave in and part of the roof is missing.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  Neighbors complained and the city planned to bulldoze the home.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  They said it was just too dangerous to live in.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  I have no place to go.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  Then the weekend came and so did help.
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.000]  By Sunday, Campana had almost 100 volunteers working on his property, building him a new home.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  Volunteers so anxious to help, they started without a city building permit.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  We had some naysayers out here saying, don't do it, don't do it.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  You're going to go to jail. And these people kept digging.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  No ambulance to do a final inspection on Monday than have Campana's house bulldoze down Tuesday.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  But thanks to some hard-working volunteers, things have changed.
[57:38.000 --> 57:44.000]  Monday, the city gave volunteers a permit, postponed demolition and approved building plans.
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.000]  The floor plan itself is more like just a small studio or an efficiency apartment.
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.000]  It'll have a kitchen on one side, a living area and a sleeping area in the back.
[57:53.000 --> 58:01.000]  It's such an absolute marvel to see the people that have come out to essentially build a house for someone that no one knows.
[58:01.000 --> 58:08.000]  I owe them a debt and I can't work to repay it, but I can donate to repay it.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  These workers don't want anything in return. They just want to help.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  I'm exhausted.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  You ready?
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  Yeah.
[58:17.000 --> 58:26.000]  Lance, you've been out here all day slaving away. People have just been donating everything from entire electrical systems, doors, windows, thousands of dollars of lumber.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  How does it feel to see you?
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.000]  This is the best thing. I'm so glad that we seized this opportunity to help Joe get his place in order.
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.000]  I can't believe that the city's not out here getting behind us and supporting us.
[58:40.000 --> 58:48.000]  These are all volunteers. These aren't any city people out here, but it's great that we're taking this opportunity to do this for him.
[58:48.000 --> 58:54.000]  Guy served in World War II and this is long overdue.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  You don't want to see this place bulldozed?
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  No. We don't want to let that happen.
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.000]  I think that would be a disgrace. That would be a shame to do that to this man's property.
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.000]  He doesn't want to leave. He just wants a decent place to live. He doesn't want his house bulldozed.
[59:08.000 --> 59:14.000]  He wants to stay right here and I think we owe him that and that's just how I feel about it.
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  I'm glad to have this opportunity to be here to help him.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  Thank you very much, buddy.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Hey, Brian, does it feel good to be involved in something like this?
[59:22.000 --> 59:28.000]  Yeah, it feels real good. I think it really shows how the American spirit hasn't gone.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  It hasn't really left. There's still some good people in this country.
[59:31.000 --> 59:42.000]  And to see this old man who's fought in the war in World War II, one of the biggest, you know, for us to come out here and help him is really great, you know.
[59:42.000 --> 59:53.000]  They treat prisoners with more respect and care more about their rights and their concerns and their health issues than people that are retired and disabled and veterans of foreign wars. It's ridiculous.
[59:53.000 --> 59:58.000]  You have to remember criminals are important to wreak havoc. It's part of order out of chaos.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  You know, if they'd lock them up and said letting them go, we wouldn't have the problems we have today and we wouldn't need this huge police force. It's all an excuse.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  They let convicted murderers out. They go and kill again and they're surprised. It's ridiculous.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  At the same time, nonviolent people are spending more time.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  And people that are in there for nonviolent offenses, the three strikes, they aim for, like, small-time drug dealers.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  I mean, you know, if the government wouldn't bring the drugs in, there wouldn't be a problem.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Great point, sir. Thank you. Let's go talk to Lewis.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Tell us, Mr. Lewis, good to see you again. Good to have lunch with you.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Hey, we appreciate you coming out and supporting us in what we're doing and hoping to get him out of that dangerous structure and get him into this new one.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Well, that's the same thing the city tried to do before and, you know, he refused to let them build one before.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Sometime ago, I don't know exactly when, but...
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  I'm not glad that people are taking this opportunity to help their neighbors.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  He has a letter that he actually was offered that.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  And then it seems that that person that offered it to him from the city was no longer there.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Well, I don't know. I wasn't there tonight.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I understand you're a new council member.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Well, thanks for coming out. Does it make you feel good to see all these folks out here?
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  They said it was about 40 out here. I talked to 42 the day and they said it was about 42 people out here earlier.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  I mean, about 40 people are so earlier.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  We've had about over 100 since 8 o'clock this morning.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  All the folks had to go.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Well, have you seen all the lumber we've got?
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  He just gave me two of it and he was explaining to me what process they're going to do next week.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  We'll get started on getting the permit in the morning.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  God bless you, sir. Thank you very much.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Well, that's Council Member Lewis doing the decent thing.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  There were like 100 people here over the day or over.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I mean, just everybody from church groups to people in the building rights to just anybody who felt that they could meet.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I'm just glad it happened.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  How do you think it's all going to play out?
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Well, you know, it only has one way to go and that's it.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  I don't see anything that would play out any different.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  They're going to apply for a permit in the morning and it shouldn't take but, you know, I mean, it should be something that could be done.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  The inspectors come out and people will be able to go on.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  This is a situation that requires some deviation.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  You're not going to spend the six weeks or two months or whatever you're going through the permit process.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  So I think it'll play out to everyone's benefit and everyone's hope and desire.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Now, you know, I've been working with the Federation of Veterans Affairs.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  So, you know, me being a veteran, you know, I have some...
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  There's a lot of veterans here today.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Yeah, that's what I understand. I was talking to Susan from Channel 42 and she said it was quite a few.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And I expect as soon as the word get out, it'll be a lot more.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Now, as we break here for a second, we'll let the plane go over.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Yeah.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  And...
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  I don't think it's only about three or four more months.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  That's right. 15 weeks.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  A hundred or so days and these planes won't be doing this no more.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Completely closed.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  No more airplanes.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  No.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  No.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  Sir, can we ask you how do you feel about all this activity in your front yard today?
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Nothing like this ever happened to me before in my life.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  And I am so proud of these people being real Americans and showing what you believe is right
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  and you are right about the matter, right?
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Yes.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  Sir, how many years?
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  40 years.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  40 years.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  I moved here in 1959 and this is 1999.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Now, your house is a little run down.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  You could use a few repairs but it looks like they're going to build you in a brand new
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  house in your front yard.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Is that your understanding?
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  That's what they're doing and they're doing it so rapidly.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I didn't know they could do it that fast.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  And what will happen to the house you're living in right now, sir?
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Well, I want to save it as long as any aircraft is flying over.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Okay.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  I might not need it so bad if there aren't any more aircraft.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  But I could still use it for storage and it would give me more room to have a hobby
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  and something.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  But it's no danger to anyone else.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  It's fault.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  It's exaggeration.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  It's hyperbolic.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  No one has been harmed in 20 years that I've lived.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Are you glad that the bulldozers have been stopped for the time being?
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Boy, do I.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Do I.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Yes, I do.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  This is the most encouraging thing I've heard that they're not going to destroy it.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  Now, I hope.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Now, yesterday on KI, you acted a little bit surprised and said, is this for real?
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  Why don't you let the plane roll over and hold on one second so that the plane can go over.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  Yesterday on KI, you were a little bit skeptic about what me and Mike came out and told you,
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  weren't you?
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Yes.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  I don't know what was up, you know.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Now you've got a house half built and all the fixtures and doors and has an electric.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  It's amazing, right?
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  We're going to crush the new world order.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  You guys are great.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Now, you mentioned you wanted to keep this house up as long as the airplanes keep flying
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  over.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  You are aware that this airport, Robert Miller Airport, is going to completely close down
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  in 15 weeks.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  You're going to put state office building out there and it won't be any airplanes flying
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  over this neighborhood in about 15 weeks.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  A lot of them prove the value of the property.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  Yes.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  In fact, some people were thinking that because the property value is going up.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  Oh, yes.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  They're interested in your property.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  We had people here today running off with plans telling us we better not build and now
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  the council member comes out.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  They say it's fine.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  We're allowed to do this and we're doing it according to permits.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  That's what I said this morning, Jim, is that we've constructed it.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  We've built it, but we haven't poured the concrete.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  We've got all the basics ready to go, the foundation ready to go, all the superstructure built,
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  and now it's just like assembling a Lego set.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  All it takes is the permits and we're go.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Of course, you have no interest in leaving your home of 40 years, right?
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  I don't want to leave here.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  I like it here.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  I know the climate's mild and it's not in a hurricane path and it's a safe place to live
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  except the city has aggravated me for 20 years about this matter.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  I mean, he has 20 years of documents.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  We'll show you, Jim, and KLBJ.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  Are you going to understand that?
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Yeah.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Well, I live just one block away and had seen your house for many years and it's a little
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  concerned.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  I could use a little fixing up, but I could see why you wouldn't want your home bulldoze
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  to be run out.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  And I have to say I'm equally amazed at this construction and the speed of it and the number
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  of people.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  It's really a groundswell.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Look what members can do when 100 people working on it and look in one day how much you've
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  got accomplished.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Well, we've got to thank KI and we've got to thank all these people that showed up here.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Yes.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  I wish to express my eternal gratitude and I don't know how to say it other than that,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  but if you have a charity, I'm going to contribute to that.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  I don't have a charity.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Alex Jones and Mike Hansen and Steve Lane just want to get out here and help you.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  And at the same time showing there's decent people out there, all these veterans, all
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  these families, men, women, children out here working.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  That's it.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  You're going to have a new house by Sunday if the city doesn't come in here and bulldoze
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  what we're doing.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  If they give us the permits and Willie Lewis has agreed.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  So we're going forward.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  If you can just get the rest of the council to back off.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  Damn, it's over here or what?
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  All right, I'm going to sing a little song right now and I'm going to play it on this
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  guitar that was given to me by Mr. Joe Campana.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  I love it.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  It's a little Sears or Robo.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  It's my new favorite guitar.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  Oh, it's that guitar.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Oh, there's a new song on it.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  The Cougs that is the so called anti government right wing conspiracy nuts.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  All went out for the same Joe's home the SOS was shouted out by Mr. Alex judge.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Patriots came and they did all they could do to help you save this hero of war two.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  The big one that is Joe's a junior in high school with a farm exclusion and an only
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  child exclusion when they drafted him and tested the atomic bomb on it.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  Next thing you know, old Joe's yard was friendly volunteers and materials.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  They said, we're going to help you and you will not have to leave your silver painted
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  trailer or the comforts you need the comforts of home.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Whatever they may be their private property a man's castle are supposed to be.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  And now it's time to say a thanks to Joe and all his friends.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  And we would like to thank you folks for kindly pitching in.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  Thanks for coming out for barbecue that Saturday to have a heap and helping of our hospitality.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  All American hospitality that is it was all made and born in the USA just like our new
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  American hero Mr. Joe Campana.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  And Austin vet is moving into his new home today.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  K I has followed Austin volunteers as they help build new dreams for Joe Campana.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  K I's Julie Gersa joins us live from Campana's home in central Austin.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Julie, how's it look out there?
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Market looks really good.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Now this you're looking at is the old home at 618 East 49th.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  This is how it all started.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Joe Campana a disabled World War two in Korea vet has been here for more than 40 years.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  I told him a couple of years ago he was going to have to move because they said that this home was unsafe.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Well, when people saw this story on K I and ladies heard about it on a radio talk show and cable show.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They decided they weren't going to stand by and let this happen.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  So hundreds of volunteers have donated their time and their money appliances deciding you see on the house.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  And this is what Austinites who care built.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And today Joe Campana had his big moment.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Hope you enjoy your new house.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Joe got the keys to the home today.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  It is a modest cottage, but this place is furnished from top to bottom.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  They donated furniture, everything in here all down to the little details.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  Now we talked to Joe about this gift that Austinites have given him because they care so much about him.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  And he was very moved by what they did for him.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  It is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me that I can recall.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  And Mark, in case you wanted to know what it looked like inside, here it is fully furnished.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Some volunteers have been working on this for a long time.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  They just happen to be in here watching.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  They can hear the cheers from outside.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  They're very tired.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  This has been, they did this in 13 days.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  A city record, Councilman Lewis said it was a record the time that they got the permits.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  But they wanted to make sure that they beat the bulldozers and Mark they did.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  All right, Julie, that's a fantastic story.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  A way to have the community get together in such a short period of time.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  All right.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  We're in front of Mr. Joe Copana's house.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  And I guess you can see behind me, we've got a front end loader from a demolition company.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And they're going to scoop up Joe's old house and cart it off.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Of course, we've got big thunderstorms coming through, maybe a omen of things to come here.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  We're out here for the unconstitutional demolition of Mr. Joe Copana's old house.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  So we'll get it all on videotape and hope you enjoy what we do to our elderly in Austin.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  And they're going to put a lien on the place for that.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  So we'll have to get that taken care of.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Oh, they said they were going to donate the demolition.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  The guy wasn't going to charge it.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Well, maybe they won't.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  These are developing facts all the time, folks.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  They may or may not put a lien on Joe's house.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Anyway, Joe ought to be left alone in peace.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  But that's a part of smart growth in Austin.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  A lot this size you can put about five row houses on.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  So welcome to smart growth.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  We're by deliberation from the county court.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  It was here under other and the cause is jeopardy and they had to prove injury.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  And there is no injury.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  It hasn't been any.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  They're claiming the house is a very dangerous place.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  It isn't.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  It's been the same way for 28 years.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  I showed it up.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I showed it up so well.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  It hasn't deteriorated in all that time beyond deterioration it has.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  But the damages here were caused by the city.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  And they've been arresting me and finding me and even usurping my property over the matter.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  And it's time for this stuff to get settled properly and stop this criminal illegal practice.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  The city seems to think it has a right to indulge in when it doesn't.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  How long have you lived here, Joe?
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  I've lived here since 1959.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  That makes it 40 years.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  How many houses were on this block when you moved here, Joe?
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  What was that, man?
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  How many other houses were on this block when you moved here?
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Oh, I don't know about the same number, I guess, except the one next door built an upstairs to it.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  And it's a lot of time.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  It's been about the same all those years.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  But the property is becoming more valuable because the airport is going to move out to Bergstrom.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  And I think the city is after the land.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  And I think if they thought they could get away with it, they'd go on doing it.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  Because when the lawyer called him, he says, like, we got caught.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  You know, like they were doing something they thought they could get away with, so they got caught and then he said they couldn't.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  We don't get on film.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Joe's home.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  And this is the last time we'll see it, Tony, say that.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  They've been wishing people were out front.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  They've cleaned out everything that we could.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  Man's got a lifetime in here.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  He lived like this for 25 years.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  The house being in this state of this repair.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  This is his home.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  They have the right to live like this.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  We've got a bomb shelter in the middle of the floor, excavated underneath the house, so we can play around the labs.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  And we're pulling forward.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  We've got a bulldozer walking up the sidewalk.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  Here's the background.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  Joe, we love you, buddy.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  We did what we could.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  Here comes a front-end loader to tear it down.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Your house will be next.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  Maybe you think, oh, the hell with old Joe, but here it is, live and in color.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  This is the teeth of the government here.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  The teeth of the government ready to knock down Joe's house.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  It's a dark day.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  We got the severe thunderstorm warning in.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  I wonder if this is an omen of things to come.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  We did manage to move everything out of the house.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Mike and Lance and Scott and others came to move it out.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  Not quite as many people as when we were building it, but it's not much fun here.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Anyway, we'll get more pictures when the teeth of the government takes its first bite of Joe.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  We've got a close-up of the flag flying over Joe Capana's house.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  I don't know if the operators have noticed it, but it'll go down with the rubble.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Of course, we know the flag's been trampled on by Clinton administration, this city council and others.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  It's nothing new to disgrace the American flag.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  Joe's a World War II veteran, and the front-end loader is about to take a bite out of Joe's freedom.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  And yours too, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Joe talking with the demolition fellows and a few of the people that came out to help.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  That's Tony. He did the tile work in Joe's new house.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  And Gail, she's been helping all the last couple of days moving stuff out of Joe's house.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  A difficult thing to do, but somebody had to do it. Joe couldn't do it.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  Joe hadn't had, but like two hours of sleep the whole day.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  I guess if they were going to knock your house down, you probably wouldn't get much sleep either.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  Anyway, it's going to happen shortly.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Bitting that we're fixing to have a big giant thunderstorm with damaging winds and large hail across the street.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  We got the bureaucrats, they're just drooling while watching this process go on.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  I'm glad it's not my wife's work to demolish World War II veterans home and enjoy it.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Anyway, we're fixing the winds change out of the north in the last 15 minutes.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  And we're going to see a pretty good storm.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  So God's watching old Joe and Joe's got courage.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  And we're just going to tell the government to go to hell.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  And we're going to go after them after this is all over with.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  So here goes the teeth of government fixing to take its first bite at Joe's house.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  They took down quite a few of my campaign signs.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  Here it goes. Liberty teeth there for Joe Campana.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  We're just following orders out here.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  Boy, look, the whole thing rocked.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Get a picture of it.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Now the flag is still flying.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Well, let's back up.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  We'll get the whole thing on tape here.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  Pretty sad. There it goes.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  The whole house shook when it took a first bite at Joe's house here.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  The rain has led up a little bit for this event.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  It's just kind of speechless.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  I feel like the guy when the Hindenburg blew up, he was pretty excited.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  But we're watching him knock it down now.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  How long has Joe lived here for like 50 years? 40 years.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  And they're knocking it down mainly because the neighbors didn't like the looks of it.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  Even if Joe stayed in it.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  He said it's been pretty much in this shape for the last 20 years anyway.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Are you still rolling?
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  Okay, Mike's still rolling.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  I'm trying to get the microphone underneath the umbrella.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  Here goes, we're going to take another scoop.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Another scoop out of freedom.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  Another scoop out of freedom.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  The flag's still up.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Reminds you a little bit of Waco.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  At least the BATF's not out here.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Here goes the whole thing.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  They're knocking Joe's house out.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  How's Joe doing in the house?
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  I wish we had two cameras.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  Is he in there alone?
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  Yeah, there goes the Joe's.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  That used to be Joe's kitchen and the flag's still standing.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Maybe that'll be the last thing to go.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  These people don't care.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  And now it's raining like hell.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Isn't it interesting that the rains picked up as the demolitions picked up here?
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  God bless America and the hell with the salamanders and these salamander lovers.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  That'll spend $26,000 a piece to put in a salamander handrail,
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  but it'll tear down an old man's house.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  These guys are pieces of crap.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  People are taking pictures in the background.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  We don't have any problem with A&R demolition.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  What we understand is that they're going to donate their time to this because they realize what's happening.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Maybe we'll find a million dollars in there.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Joe's next door in his house.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  I'm just going to comment.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Oh, I'm ready. People just need to watch it.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  There goes the whole house is moving.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  The whole house is shaking.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  And here comes the flag.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Here comes the flag.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Whoa, it's still standing.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Yeah, look at that.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  The house has totally fell down, but the flag's still standing.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  God bless America.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  Land that I love.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Yeah, so much.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  It's free.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  It's God bless the salamander God.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  That's our new God, a little blind salamander.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Yeah, I bet you city officials are frothing at the mouth over this.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Yeah, Joe, they can put up at least five row houses.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Oh, the flag's still standing.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Yeah, it's raining like hell out here.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  We got the lightning and we got the neighbors all out to watch them knock down Joe's house.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, is your house next?
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Wake up.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  I can't believe we're witnessing this just because they don't like the looks of it.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  I've been in beer joints that look a whole lot worse than Joe's house.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  Oh, this thing's getting wet out here.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  Oh, not me. I'm worried about the microphone there.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  The flag's still standing. I hope you don't take it down.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Oh, you're still getting...
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Well, if he does, when they take it down, it's a literal and symbolic gesture that Liberty is gone.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Okay.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Now look, the rain is at its height now.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  The rain is at its height.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Oh, there it is, Liberty.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  Oh, that's the end of Liberty that's raining its worst.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Oh, boy, that's what they think of that flag.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  That's what they think.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  No, it worked out good.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  The rain is at its height.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  The rain is at its height.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  The flag is down here.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And so is Joe's house here.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Yeah, we believe the house was raggedy, but Joe should have had the right to keep it.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  You notice it hasn't fallen over on his neighbors.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  It hasn't gotten anything on his neighbors.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  Joe lived clean in the house, probably cleaner than most of us.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  He didn't swill beer and booze and smoke cigarettes.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Maybe you consider that bad.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  But he was a clean living or he still is a clean living man.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  And he just wanted to be left alone in his own resident.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  So his residence now is gone and the water is leaking through onto the microphone.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Whoa.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  There goes the city officials with a neighbor next door.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  COA, city of Austin, I guess.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Maybe we could, Communist of America, maybe, who knows.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Do you think we should get that on film?
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Well, if Tony would zoom in, I'm a little damp here.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  Rain's picking up again.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  We've just been told that Joe's inside.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  He feels real bad about this, but we're not going to lower ourselves like the national news media
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  and stick a camera in Joe's face as they demolish his house.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  But you might expect he feels bad about it.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  You'd feel bad.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  We all feel bad about the whole thing.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  A lot of us have spent a lot of time and money out here to try to remedy the situation.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And the bottom line was they should have just left Joe alone.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  And, you know, if the house fell in on Joe and he was in it, that was his wishes.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  You know, people talk about firemen and fires.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  They get killed and they say, well, they die doing what they want to do.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  But Joe should have been left alone.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  Yeah.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  So it looks like it's a tough job here.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  Here's a big bite of the house there.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  I guess they got to make a big pile out of it now.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  Every time they move it around, why it gets smaller chunks, you know?
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  I guess this is a good video of how to do demolition on a house there.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  I guess the occupants didn't want the demolition, but we're getting it anyway.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  Pulling through it in the dirt.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  It's a terrible thing.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  What they've done to them, I mean, can they just find something else to do, make better use of their time?
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  This is just absolutely ridiculous.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  World War II vet has been through it all.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  Owns his own property.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  He's been here for 20-some-odd years and they got to take the entire thing down just like that.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  With no regard.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  No regard at all.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  How's Joe?
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  Joe's inside playing some music and he's pretty upset about it.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  But this doesn't happen.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Not everybody is as lucky as Joe.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  There are people that lose their homes and don't have anything to do.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  Look out, Joe.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  They'll mash you there.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Joe's trying to rescue one of his ammo boxes.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  And we hope Joe doesn't get mashed in the process there.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  Picking up his stuff.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  What's that coming out of there?
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Oh, that's something that was in a barrel.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  Water in a barrel.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Joe's hostile about his ammo boxes.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Yeah, you got to give Joe a lot of credit for standing up in the face of the enemy here.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  We just...
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  Good people helping.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  Lance, who wrote the famous song, Ballad of Joe Capana.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  We'll play it tonight.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  There's Joe digging through his stuff, trying to rescue...
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Good stuff.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Look out, Joe.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Don't cut his hands on that stuff.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  All his stuff.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  He's got these ammo boxes.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  I don't know what he's got in them there, but he thinks a lot of them.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  Doesn't matter what he's got in them.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  They shouldn't knock his stuff down.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  Take his personal property.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  This is exclusive footage.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  Nobody in the media came out to videotape this.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  They'll come out to videotape Governor Bush at a suspected,
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  where somebody threatened to do something in a school.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  They'll come out and make a big news media deal about this.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  But they won't come down when a World War II veteran's getting his house demolished.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  Helping out.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  However, Channel 42, we've got to give them credit for coming out initially.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  But I think they were probably advised to stay away today.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  Anyway, we're out here.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  We're all soaked in the rain.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  Anyway, I got...
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  Here's some more of Joe's stuff.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  Man, it's unrecognizable now.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  I think that was Joe's bed there or something.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Okay, here's Joe trying to retrieve something out of there.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  You know, one man's trash is another man's treasure.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  I remember my dad used to go around on trash day and pick up television sets,
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  and he repaired them.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  I think, get Joe out of the way.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  Get Joe out of the way!
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Joe, here they come.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  Look at Joe.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  Now, he's trying to retrieve some possessions that we couldn't get originally.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  So, we don't want Joe to get massed.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  Now, here's the treasures of Joe Campana and Vaseline George,
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  and just some life, what he calls life support stuff.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  Oh, yeah, Joe was a medic, so...
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  He would have looked out.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  There's Kathy in disbelief here.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  Now, Kathy and Tony Tile, Joe did all the tile work in the new house
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  and worked out here for months,
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  trying to help Joe with the recovery of his stuff,
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  and they've been with him through and through from the beginning.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  There it is, the big scoop here, coming over the corner,
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  trying to get the corner of Joe's house.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  Just an hour ago, we were in there rescuing his stuff.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  Now, it's just so much junk.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  You need to get some airtime on some of those guys, I'm sure.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  We'll take one of your stuff.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  Want me to get my clothes?
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  Well, we're standing at the rear of Joe's new house
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  that the volunteers built for him
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  and a lot of good business people donated all the material for it.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  You can see in the back, well, I guess I'm calling it,
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  now you see it, now you don't.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  Joe and friends are looking for some of his stuff
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  that he's been looking for himself for years,
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:00.000]  recovering foot lockers with documents in it.
[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  Out here at his house.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  Here's everybody trying to recover Joe's stuff.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  It's pretty treacherous down there.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  I hope nobody gets a nail in their foot.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  Joe had some documents that he was saving from the atomic test site,
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  trying to get some kind of benefits from being radiated
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  during the hydrogen bomb test.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Anyway, we're looking through that.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  It kind of reminds me of the tornado in Gerald
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  where people were trying to recover their belongings.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  The only difference is here that the tornado here is the government.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  You're looking at Nelda Wells Spears,
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  Travis County tax assessor and collector.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  You will see classic examples of double speak,
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  that is lying, using semantics to shield
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  the behavior that she is engaged in.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  It is very sad that she passes the buck, number one,
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  and number two tries to deny the fact
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  that they take property and homes
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  and engage in feudalistic behavior.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And then she acts like she doesn't know what I'm talking about
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  when I use many different terms, like feudalism.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  And I'm sure she must know what feudalism means.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  I'm sure she's a smart lady.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  It means slavery.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  It means you pay a yearly rent to the government
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  to try to use and live in the home that you paid for.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  So remember, if you pay for your house and you own it,
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  or you think you own it, you do not truly own it
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  because you pay a yearly rent to the feudal masters.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Then we'll get to a property auction
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  approximately three and a half weeks
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  after we did this interview with Nelda Wells Spears
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  where she passes the buck.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  They have auctions for lots, property, businesses, homes.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  They name it.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  On Channel 17, on Travis County Television,
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  they show the homes that they foreclose on every year.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  They're in the back of the newspaper.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  Then how could she sit here and say
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  she doesn't know what we're talking about?
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  The government should not be able to take your home
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  or your automobile, the things you need to live.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  This is feudalism.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  This is terrorism engaged in by every city, county,
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  and state in the United States and the world today.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Now here's Nelda Wells Spears,
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Travis County tax collector and enforcer.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  This is Spears.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  I have a question for you.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  There are a lot of people that are not even considered middle class.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  They're losing their homes due to property taxes.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And we have seen the rates of property taxes go up and up and up
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  while people can't sell their homes because of the watershed laws.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  What's your opinion on that?
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  I really don't have an opinion on that.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  I wasn't aware that a lot of people are losing their homes.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Oh, nobody's losing their homes?
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  I didn't say nobody, but not a lot of people.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  A lot of people aren't?
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  No, a lot of people aren't.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  How do you feel about making people support public schools
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  where the test scores have dropped from number one
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  50 years ago to number 49th now with their property taxes?
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  Isn't that a form of feudalism?
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  I have the foggiest notion of what you're talking about.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  Well, you do tax talk.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  I mean, I heard everybody congratulating themselves on here about it.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  We collect property taxes for jurisdictions in Travis County
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  as the constitution of the state of Texas requires.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  But I'm probably not the person you need to be talking to.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  How many bureaucrats were here today? About 100?
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  I have no idea.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  And they were all being congratulated for the departments going from,
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  I heard one parole officer and truancy officer bragging.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  They went from seven to 107.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  The ceremony in there was for years of service to Travis County.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  I understand.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  How many homes will be lost due to the 13 million overage on the county budget?
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I'm not sure that any homes will be lost.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  Well, aren't you going to have to turn up the heat and squeeze some more people?
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  We're not squeezing people.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  We're simply collecting the tax and simply enforcing the law.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Man, I'm not being sarcastic when I say this.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Was Martin Luther King bad whenever he went and sat in at the lunch counters
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  and was taken to jail and beaten because it was the law that black people couldn't use
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  water fountains or go in and sit at lunch counters?
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Or what about when that one lady refused the law because she thought it was wrong
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  and sat at the front of the bus?
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  What about it? What about Rosa Parks?
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  What about her?
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  Well, you act like all laws are holy and sacred and that nothing's wrong with them.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  My grandparents have had their house attempted to be stolen.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  They're over 75 years old.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  They live in a modest South Austin home.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Something's wrong here.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  We don't steal anyone's homes.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  You don't steal homes?
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  No, we don't.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Y'all don't put liens on homes?
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  There's a tax lien that is attached at January 1st of every year for every property in the county.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Well, you just heard that.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  We're not stealing homes, but we do put a lien on everyone's house at the start of each year.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Even before it's time to pay, they just have that threat there.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  They have that sheriff, that constable, standing there at the ready just like of old,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  just like in feudal Europe or feudal Japan or feudal China, feudal Russia.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Oh, it's always the same.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  I guess we're not modern at all, are we?
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  We're still slaves of old.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  It's just high tech now with a pretty face.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  Five years old.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  They live in a modest South Austin home.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Something's wrong here.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  We don't steal anyone's homes.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  You don't steal homes?
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  No, we don't.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Y'all don't put liens on homes?
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  There's a tax lien that is attached at January 1st of every year for every property
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  in the county.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  So you're not stealing homes, I see.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  That's correct.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  We're not stealing homes.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Oh, they're your homes.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  I see.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  They haven't paid, so they're your homes.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  No.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  They're your slaves, I think.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  No.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Because you're the local biker.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  I'm none of that.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  I'm a local tax collector, period.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  You're the local tax collector.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  How do you sleep at night?
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  Very well, thank you.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  You sleep very well knowing the families you've wrecked.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  We've not wrecked any families.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  We've not taken any homes.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  You've not taken any homes?
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  You're saying the county's never taken any homes?
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  I didn't say never.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  You said we haven't taken any homes?
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  I'm not aware of it.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  I've seen y'all listing the homes that have been taken.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  I've been mailed things to mail about auctions and homes that are being sold by the hundreds.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Those are not necessarily people's homes where people are living.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  What do you mean they're houses?
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  There are lots of vacant lots.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  No.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  There are vacant lots.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  I've seen you.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  This lady right here, she's having her house stolen.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  She's taking it up with someone else.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  She has.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  She's here every week.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Every week.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  How can you steal her?
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  The last question.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  You say that you're not selling people's homes.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  You show the foreclosed homes on TV that you're taking.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  You've shown them on TV.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  You're right.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  You're my home now, ma'am.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  On Channel 17.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Thanks.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  What about my cameraman?
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  You're trying to steal his house.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  Well, he can come to the office and we'll talk about it.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  He can come to the office?
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  Ma'am, hey, we're not some type of evil people.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Ma'am, and you said that the hell...
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  You said that we're a bunch of conspiracy theorists, Sheriff.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  You know these helicopters are being used, Sheriff.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  These helicopters are being used for surveillance.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  You know they're putting flair on them.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  You admitted it.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  Yes, we're putting flair on them.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  What about the fans?
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  We stopped the Delta Force.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  What about the Delta Force, Sheriff?
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  I don't know.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  And you're about the Delta Force.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  And I'd ask that you get the microphone out of my face.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  You want the microphone out of your face?
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  I'm sorry for trying to report the news.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  And now we switch gears to the steps of the County Courthouse
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  three and a half weeks later after Nell DeWell Spears.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  And take a look.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Yes, I've given it this nightmare effect just to make us all think a little bit
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  about where we are in the country today.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  Look at all the people out there begging and choffing and pleading
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  and bidding on property and the armed guards out there carefully keeping watch.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  And later you'll see some guards actually bidding on things
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  to get the bids up a little extra manipulation.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Isn't this interesting?
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  But they're not stealing property.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Oh, certainly not.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  It's just very, very saddening to me to see the public out here.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  This is so archaic.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  The government says they're interested in our welfare,
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  but they'll actually take your home or your property.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Unbelievable.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  It's actually to some of this sickening behavior.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  Ah, yes, the den of iniquity, the den of fiefdom, corruption, power,
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  backroom deals, favoritism.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Can you imagine what the federal and supernatural levels are like?
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  But look at the people.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  They just accept this criminality.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  This is a dominant one.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  Five minutes.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  We're going to begin the conference.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  We'll sell about five minutes.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  Pay close attention to this fellow from Parks and Recreation.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  We'll get to this just a little bit later.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  We're going to begin the constable sale now.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  We're going to begin the constable sale.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  We're going to start with two lodges that are in Briarcliff.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  This is in clause number 9208940.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  We're going to start with lodged 646.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  This is going to be lodged 646 in Briarcliff, section 15.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  The location is 402 Strickland Drive.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  By virtue of a certain order of sale issued pursuant to a judgment by the District Court
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  in Travis County, Texas, in clause number 9208940,
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  sell Travis County et al.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  versus Dina Sue Nelson Brewster et al.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Another authority of Brewstale Fat Constable of Travis County Precinct 5.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  It is on June 28, 1998 at 10 a.m.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  Levy upon the falling described property located in Travis County.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  It's the property of the judgment debtor, Dina Sue Nelson Brewster et al.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  That being lodged 646 for Briarcliff, Incorporated, section 15.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  Plat number 42 slash 47.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  That's described in volume 8751, page 746 of the deed records of Travis County, Texas.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  On-set properties known to warranties expressed or implied,
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  you buy debtor's interest in the property as is.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  The debtors are further advised that the purchase of the debtor's interest
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  instead of property at this sale may not extinguish any lands or security
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  interest on the property.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  You're only buying whatever interest, if any, the debtor has in the property.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  Subjects are offered to the right of the judgment debtor
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  or any person having an interest in set property
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  to redeem set property or their interest therein
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  at any time within the time described by law
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  to date the purchasers' dues filed for the record
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  in the manner provided for by law
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  and subject to any other rights to which anyone is entitled to under the law.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  I know that that legal ease doesn't sound very exciting,
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  but what you have here is lots and homes and businesses being auctioned off.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  In fact, the county will even send these out to you monthly if you want the listings.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  They're in the newspaper, and again, they're on channel 17.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  Let's get back to this because the story hasn't even begun yet.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  You heard him, the debtors, the judge that took the property, the love.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  That's what we're dealing with here, total corruption,
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  sanctioned by the government, done by the government.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  For our Cliff Incorporated section 15, the minimum bid is $3,508.91.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  Do I have an opening bid?
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  I'm sorry? Yeah. Yeah, what?
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  The opening bid again.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  Give me the number.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  My number?
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  Tell me what you want to bid for the property.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  $3,508.91.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  $3,508.91.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  Tell me, slave, I'm a slave.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  Oh, yes, slave and a man, you tell me now.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  How dare you?
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  How much money for this slave's property? Tell me now.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  $3,600.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  I'll take $3,700.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  $3,700.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  I got a bid of $3,700.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  I got a bid of $3,700.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  I get $3,800.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Sir, I got a bid of $3,800.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  I got a bid of $3,800.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  I'll take $3,900.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  I got a bid of $3,900.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  I got a bid of $3,900.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  I bid 4,000.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  I got a bid of 4,000.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  I'll do 41.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  4,100.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  I got a bid of $4,100.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:55.440]  Got a bid of $4,100.
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:59.480]  The behavior went on incessantly as the bids went up.
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:03.440]  Now, pay close attention to that fella.
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:08.840]  Our cameraman, Mike, was busy getting interviews and talking to people during the bidding and
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:13.720]  filming the main person that was giving the bids from the Sheriff's Department.
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:20.920]  But that fella right there from the Park Service, John Foreman and I witness and one of our
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:26.240]  associates saw him getting the bids up from the back of the crowd.
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:32.520]  And let's go ahead and go to John Foreman and see what he saw there at the auction.
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:39.680]  Bid rigging perhaps, getting the bids up.
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:45.440]  A lot of shifty behavior going on that day by some of the law enforcement officials from
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:50.320]  all different branches of the government here in central Texas.
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:53.960]  A lot of interesting behavior.
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:58.080]  Also bidding here against the property and he was armed and I don't know if that's permissible
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:00.400]  here in Travis County.
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:04.720]  I thought if you're on duty and you have a firearm, what are you doing down here bidding
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:10.000]  against citizens for the theft of these properties?
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:15.800]  You know, it just doesn't make any sense to me if a citizen is going to come down here
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:23.480]  and bid and try to get the lowest bid possible that he shouldn't have an officer of the county
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:25.880]  bidding against him, especially if he's on duty.
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:30.920]  And we need to check into that and probably check over with the county commissioners to
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:36.760]  find out who's in charge of this and try to figure out whether or not that gentleman had
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:39.480]  any authority to bid up these properties.
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:42.280]  Like I said, maybe he was doing it as a private citizen.
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:46.440]  But if you're carrying a gun, to me, you're on duty.
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:48.440]  That was the park ranger.
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:51.560]  That was the park ranger, Mr. Nielsen.
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:58.080]  I think it was A. Nielsen, but don't quote me on his letter of his first name, but I'm
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:49:59.080]  almost positive.
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:01.400]  His last name is Nielsen.
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:03.480]  Well, good job, John Forman.
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:05.200]  It does look like Nielsen.
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:11.080]  That was the best shot that we got of his name tag.
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:14.600]  And it certainly does look like Nielsen, but again, it's a little blurred that are on the
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:16.920]  camera, so we're not sure.
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:20.320]  We apologize for not covering the entire crowd and everything that was going on.
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.120]  But good job, John Forman, for spotting that activity.
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:27.720]  And we'll definitely try to investigate this, but we'll usually run into the same brick
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:34.080]  walls like we have with Neldewell Spears saying they don't take people's property.
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:38.200]  And then she waltzes and says they do, and then she says they don't.
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:42.360]  They have the power and they think that we don't, and we don't as long as people don't
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:43.360]  get involved.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:44.360]  They're making a lot.
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:45.360]  I've seen you.
[1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  This lady right here.
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:47.360]  She's having her house stolen.
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:48.360]  Well, she's taking up with someone else.
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:49.360]  She has.
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:50.360]  She's here every week.
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:51.360]  Every week.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:52.360]  I didn't do it to her.
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:53.360]  I have a sliver now.
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  Okay, last question.
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:58.120]  You say that you're not some people's homes.
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:01.160]  You show the foreclosed homes on TV that you're taking.
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:02.160]  You shown them on TV.
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:03.680]  You're trying to steal my home now, man.
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:04.680]  On Channel 17.
[1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:05.680]  Thanks.
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:06.680]  What about my cameraman?
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:07.680]  You're trying to steal his house.
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:11.560]  Well, he could come to the office and we'll talk about his house.
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:12.560]  He could come to the office?
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:15.040]  Ma'am, hey, we're not some type of evil people.
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:21.040]  Ma'am, and you said that we're a bunch of conspiracy theorists, Sheriff.
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:24.720]  You know these helicopters are being used, Sheriff.
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:28.400]  These helicopters are being used for surveillance.
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:29.400]  You know they're putting flair on them.
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:30.400]  You admitted it.
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:31.640]  Yeah, they're putting flair on them.
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:32.640]  What about the Feds?
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:33.640]  We stopped the Delta Force.
[1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:34.640]  What about the Delta Force, Sheriff?
[1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:38.480]  I don't know, you're about the Delta Force, Mr. Jones, and I'd ask that you get the microphone
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:39.480]  out of my face.
[1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:41.920]  You want the microphone out of your face?
[1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:42.920]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:43.920]  I'm sorry for trying to report the news.
[1:51:43.920 --> 1:52:09.920]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:38.520]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:53:04.520]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:30.520]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:59.880]  We are on top of the shed, looking at the old house.
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:07.880]  You can see the roof is caved in, and that room there totally.
[1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:08.880]  And there's the new house.
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:37.680]  Yeah, boy, that's to the new world of water.
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:50.840]  Yeah.
