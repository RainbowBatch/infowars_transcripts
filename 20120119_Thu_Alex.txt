[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it

[00:11.360 --> 00:17.440]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:19.760 --> 00:24.680]  That's right ladies and gentlemen we are live. Thank you so much for joining us

[00:30.520 --> 00:31.960]  2012

[00:47.880 --> 00:51.760]  We're also looking at some other guests today
[00:51.760 --> 00:58.880]  Yeah, there is just so much going on so much happening this article has gone up at infowars.com
[01:00.040 --> 01:06.480]  We're all gonna hang together hang separate as Benjamin Franklin said Google is already using SOPA like censorship
[01:06.720 --> 01:09.360]  It's just the mega corporations want this power themselves
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.160]  With government they don't want government having the express power and the way government was going to implement
[01:15.160 --> 01:20.640]  This would screw up some of the internet and was so ham-fisted this article is important. Please get that out
[01:20.640 --> 01:22.640]  We got a lot of good news coming up
[01:22.880 --> 01:25.080]  Rand Paul vows to block internet
[01:25.680 --> 01:30.080]  Censorship bills SOPA and PIPA are a threat to free speech. He says
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.600]  Congress claims they're pulling out the bad provisions down, but that's playing possum
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.360]  Let's see what they do next week with this vote and thank God for Rand Paul
[01:41.680 --> 01:45.000]  And thank God for Ron Paul as well
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.480]  Here's another article at prison planet calm Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike in daa's
[01:52.640 --> 01:54.640]  unconstitutional police state
[01:54.680 --> 01:59.720]  subsections that allow secret arrests of citizens indefinite detention torture total war
[02:00.560 --> 02:03.760]  And it's a good thing in four wars calm in this syndicated radio
[02:04.160 --> 02:10.880]  Internet video feed is going to millions of people because there's no news out there about Ron Paul doing this
[02:10.880 --> 02:14.680]  There is almost no news out there
[02:15.600 --> 02:18.560]  About his speech. I saw the corporate traitor dinosaur
[02:19.200 --> 02:21.200]  prostitute slime bag
[02:23.040 --> 02:26.200]  Makeup face teleprompter shell out
[02:27.160 --> 02:29.360]  globalist zombie-controlled media
[02:30.200 --> 02:32.200]  Gotta quit doing that. It's just it's fun
[02:33.760 --> 02:36.200]  Some of the names for that disease of traitors
[02:36.200 --> 02:40.760]  And of scum and a plague that it's hard to stop
[02:41.120 --> 02:45.640]  That oh he went and did his futile vote against a debt increase
[02:45.720 --> 02:52.240]  Yeah, few tall few tall to audit the Fed passed the house last year from no sponsors ten years ago
[02:52.240 --> 02:55.780]  You know and people have exposed the Fed. Oh, it's futile Ron Paul
[02:55.780 --> 03:01.360]  Oh, but never mentioning his real reason his main reason was to introduce legislation to announce
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.400]  He's introducing and I guess today to begin the repeal of the Constitution killing nd aa
[03:09.320 --> 03:11.840]  And then we've got the really big news, I don't even know how to
[03:12.440 --> 03:17.080]  Fathom this we knew that was fraud and I'll we knew Ron Paul clearly was in first place
[03:17.200 --> 03:20.280]  It was he was just right behind the other two scallywags
[03:21.360 --> 03:27.780]  And now they're announcing in the news finally, Iowa Talley gives Santorum edge over Romney
[03:27.780 --> 03:33.140]  Oh winner declared. So I guess let's have another gentleman's agreement to put Santorum
[03:33.140 --> 03:37.800]  Who's now in first like they put him in second and Karl Rove admitted that will play that clip again
[03:38.420 --> 03:41.020]  Coming up and this is all over the news. The Des Moines Register
[03:41.760 --> 03:44.540]  Mentions that well, it's it's unresolved
[03:45.420 --> 03:48.300]  register exclusive 2012 GOP caucuses count
[03:49.460 --> 03:51.460]  unresolved
[03:51.700 --> 03:53.700]  They're unresolved
[03:53.700 --> 03:59.600]  But that's okay because they're just going to give it to Santorum now and there's no
[04:00.580 --> 04:02.580]  mention of Ron Paul
[04:03.900 --> 04:09.760]  No mention of Ron Paul this will make your head spin
[04:11.620 --> 04:13.380]  In fact, I'm here reading these articles
[04:13.380 --> 04:16.360]  They did they never mention him and they'll even mention people like
[04:16.620 --> 04:21.120]  Like Genrich and Rick Perry and people who aren't even in the race now like Rick Perry
[04:21.120 --> 04:23.040]  But
[04:23.040 --> 04:25.560]  They don't mention Paul. They're so
[04:26.200 --> 04:29.600]  Scared. I mean, there's the evidence right there
[04:30.440 --> 04:37.120]  So that's all coming up today. And then when the broadcast is over, obviously, we'll retransmit everything that was on the show today

[09:06.920 --> 09:08.920]  Quickening is obviously
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.000]  Accelerating and I've got a trillion different thoughts racing through my mind
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.360]  I will attempt to control myself today
[09:17.360 --> 09:22.640]  I will attempt to not explode in rage and anger
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.560]  But also in exaltation in the level of victories
[09:26.560 --> 09:28.000]  We're having against tyranny

[09:57.220 --> 10:03.700]  Getting that set up. I also want to say great job to all the listeners and all of our affiliates and sponsors
[10:03.900 --> 10:07.580]  We couldn't do this without you and it shows
[10:07.580 --> 10:14.420]  Every day that there are a lot of good people in this country that the majority of people want freedom and have courage
[10:14.900 --> 10:19.700]  That we could be on over a hundred AM and FM stations. I just learned that for over a month
[10:19.700 --> 10:23.340]  We've been on a big station in Albuquerque. I just learned that for over two months
[10:23.340 --> 10:28.580]  We've been on another big station in Colorado another big one in California in New York State and Florida
[10:28.580 --> 10:32.620]  I mean, we're just just exploding right now and getting in some areas
[10:32.620 --> 10:38.760]  Number one in places like Orlando and other major cities that shows you
[10:38.980 --> 10:41.940]  that the truth is hitting on all cylinders and
[10:42.340 --> 10:47.940]  People are really ready to wake up and really ready to hear the truth. That is so
[10:48.660 --> 10:51.720]  Incredibly exciting and I will try to live up
[10:52.260 --> 10:58.500]  To the responsibility I've got here and I know a lot of people have jumped through a lot of hoops to get us on the radio
[10:58.500 --> 11:03.220]  Locally in your area. I know that a lot of people have
[11:04.340 --> 11:10.660]  You've done a lot to sponsor this broadcast and support us over the years and we owe it all to you
[11:10.700 --> 11:14.340]  The listeners and supporters out there. You're not behind this show
[11:14.540 --> 11:21.660]  You are beside this show and in front of this show and all around this broadcast of awakening and understanding
[11:22.380 --> 11:24.380]  You are the key
[11:24.380 --> 11:26.380]  To
[11:26.900 --> 11:32.800]  All of this if there's a weak link it is Alex Jones and I've got my positive points
[11:33.420 --> 11:37.300]  but I understand that I'm only human it is the
[11:37.820 --> 11:43.940]  It is the wisdom of the crowd and of common sense America and people across the world
[11:44.300 --> 11:51.980]  That have verified and supported our information and helped get it out to countless millions and you are the reason this
[11:51.980 --> 11:59.180]  Broadcast and everything we do is strapped on top a giant rocket. I mean we are having a huge effect now
[11:59.180 --> 12:00.820]  I'm done ranting
[12:00.820 --> 12:04.880]  We have that big guest on SOPA coming up. We've got the latest on SOPA. We've got
[12:06.700 --> 12:08.140]  Unbelievable
[12:08.140 --> 12:16.140]  Breaking Ron Paul election 2012 news that is hiding in plain view and that no one is pointing out
[12:16.620 --> 12:18.620]  that no one is
[12:18.620 --> 12:25.380]  Is discussing out there not even on the big Ron Paul sites and I don't blame them this just broke in the last hour
[12:25.980 --> 12:31.220]  I was in here getting ready for the show and I'd heard some of it on the the local news radio
[12:31.220 --> 12:33.940]  We had on in the background and on the TV
[12:33.940 --> 12:40.060]  but it was Darren McBreen our reporter that walked in and said have you seen all these articles and I read them and the
[12:40.060 --> 12:43.080]  Spin all came together and it is so
[12:43.080 --> 12:49.160]  Outrageous what they're doing. I'm gonna tell you about that in a moment, but it's around, Iowa
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.440]  Then we've got the economic news Kodak files for bankruptcy protection
[12:55.160 --> 12:59.760]  US losing high-tech manufacturing jobs to Asia. We've lost more than a quarter
[13:00.440 --> 13:06.120]  Under globalism in just the last few years Washington Post. This is like a success report card the globalists are putting out
[13:07.280 --> 13:10.120]  Obama shut down that pipeline that would supply
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.960]  More gasoline more oil to the United States from Canada
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.520]  Of course, it'll now just go east
[13:19.360 --> 13:23.840]  Or I guess west in that case to China so that they'll get that oil
[13:23.840 --> 13:30.200]  They already get 80% of the oil that comes out of Alaska our own government blocks it vampire hedge funds are sucking grease dry
[13:30.880 --> 13:33.560]  Just amazing news on that front
[13:33.560 --> 13:41.120]  We've got some really good news from the Paul camp Ron Paul's introduced legislation to strike down
[13:41.600 --> 13:44.360]  NDAA's unconstitutional police state sections
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.780]  This got no attention anywhere
[13:48.920 --> 13:54.840]  the corporate media the only attention they gave Ron Paul because I know I was up all last night on Coast Coast a.m. and
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.480]  Big radio interviews this this this morning and I was tracking it
[13:59.480 --> 14:06.320]  nothing in the news about Ron Paul going back to Washington when the other candidates wouldn't think about it and
[14:06.720 --> 14:08.720]  voting against the debt increase
[14:09.080 --> 14:14.160]  They reported on that and said it was symbolic and pointless and he's pathetic. They didn't point all the other stuff
[14:14.160 --> 14:16.160]  He did like introduced legislation
[14:16.600 --> 14:23.340]  To repeal the secret police secret arrest total war end of habeas corpus into the Constitution
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.480]  NDAA
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.440]  radio TV print silence
[14:28.440 --> 14:30.440]  one guy
[14:30.760 --> 14:32.760]  happened to be watching
[14:32.760 --> 14:39.680]  The c-span back there in the coffee room. His name's Kurt Nemo and he wrote an article about it in the afternoon yesterday
[14:40.200 --> 14:42.200]  There was a few articles
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.780]  From the control left like Huffington Post today and I commend him for that but but that's big news right there
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.880]  Ron Paul introduced his legislation to strike NDAA's unconstitutional section
[14:52.880 --> 14:59.320]  1021 that allows the military to operate domestically the black bag citizens and
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  Of course, I think that should be more
[15:02.440 --> 15:05.840]  And and of course, he says he's introducing the bill that had been introduced
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.160]  She had a reporter that's gonna happen today or tomorrow, but hopefully we'll have the other sections
[15:10.160 --> 15:16.640]  He just mentioned his bill would have that to to not say that the worldwide battlefield without congressional approval
[15:16.960 --> 15:18.920]  Forget a declaration not even approval
[15:18.920 --> 15:25.560]  They can kill whoever they want bomb whoever they want invade whoever they want because Obama is the new master of the universe
[15:26.280 --> 15:30.400]  So you've got all of that happening with almost Z
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.180]  row
[15:32.180 --> 15:34.180]  media coverage
[15:34.200 --> 15:36.640]  dinosaur corporate prostitute prostitute media
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.520]  And we're gonna be discussing that with well really somebody you could call the father of the free software
[15:44.880 --> 15:46.880]  free internet movement
[15:46.880 --> 15:53.040]  The obi-wan Kenobi of it Richard Stallman will be joining us coming up to talk about SOPA
[15:53.040 --> 15:55.760]  But but but you know something clicked for me last night
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.880]  While I was you know, basically staying up all night. I did take an hour-long catnap
[16:01.880 --> 16:04.960]  That's why I'm so energized today. It's just amazing
[16:05.800 --> 16:10.080]  Google is already using SOPA like censorship and
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.560]  I
[16:12.560 --> 16:17.360]  Want to break this down later. Google was set up with NSA and CIA money
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.280]  You just type that into a the NSA search engine Google and you'll get Washington Post MIT magazine
[16:23.480 --> 16:30.280]  But they're like how cute it is and how sweet sea cake it is and how much fun it is and it's no big deal
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.280]  And oh, yeah the heads of Google go to Bilderberg and on and on and on
[16:36.280 --> 16:43.360]  So why did Google black out its name on its website yesterday, which was just kind of ceremonial?
[16:45.600 --> 16:52.580]  Without even linking to any information to explain what was happening like reddit and info wars calm and and and Wikipedia did
[16:52.680 --> 16:58.520]  Very effective what Wikipedia did I don't realize how much I use Wikipedia, even though it's questionable sometimes because it is
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.640]  Open source as you'd call it
[17:01.640 --> 17:09.320]  But but overall it's pretty accurate sometimes they put in there that I've died or they put this information in there about other people
[17:09.800 --> 17:14.560]  But it gets corrected and they kind of spin things and don't really have any of our
[17:14.840 --> 17:19.280]  Accomplishments on there and and cover a bunch of gossip. So so overall it's distorted
[17:19.280 --> 17:26.380]  But the general info on it at least in the bibliographies is very useful and I realized with with with Wikipedia blacked out yesterday
[17:26.640 --> 17:28.640]  How much I use it?
[17:28.640 --> 17:33.980]  Of course, I did put in a 22 hour day yesterday, but I probably without even thinking
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.080]  Was directed there or link there?
[17:37.680 --> 17:43.200]  More than 30 or 40 times. I mean I quit counting and it was blacked out and it was smart how they did it
[17:43.200 --> 17:45.280]  You'd see the info for about two seconds
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.240]  That you were looking for. Of course. I don't just believe what I read on there
[17:49.240 --> 17:52.720]  I then go check the bibliography and go to the links on the bottom, but it's it is invaluable
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.340]  It is the best encyclopedia out there. And of course, it's not a hundred percent accurate about
[17:57.340 --> 18:01.540]  Ninety-five percent accurate for my deep research. That doesn't mean I'm completely accurate either
[18:01.780 --> 18:03.940]  But the point and there's a lot of agendas there
[18:04.060 --> 18:10.140]  But you can see it for about three seconds or so and you'd be start to read the info you wanted and then boom
[18:10.140 --> 18:15.420]  it would cut to the black page and say learn about internet censorship and this SOPA bill that will
[18:15.580 --> 18:19.100]  cripple freedom on the web as we know it take political action and
[18:20.320 --> 18:22.520]  Reddit had an effective deal as well
[18:22.580 --> 18:25.980]  We just put a big banner at the top linking to some basic info about it
[18:25.980 --> 18:29.900]  That's because we've beat this dead horse over and over again. You know, we've done our job on this front
[18:29.900 --> 18:31.940]  We don't just do it on one day. We do it every day
[18:32.980 --> 18:39.700]  But everybody's missing the main enchilada here the main boat. Why is Yahoo? Why is Google?
[18:39.700 --> 18:45.180]  Why are big globalist firms that are no new world order? Why are they against it?
[18:45.180 --> 18:50.200]  it's an internal fight in the system because they don't want a
[18:50.200 --> 18:58.140]  Government with ham-fisted people having the power to shut down whatever they want whenever they want and blacklist people because Google's
[18:58.520 --> 19:03.320]  Global and basically for all intents and purposes is a large part of the internet
[19:03.320 --> 19:06.480]  I mean, I'd call it several large organs of the internet
[19:06.480 --> 19:11.720]  I mean you take those out it would be it would really have some issues and they're tentacled into everything
[19:12.080 --> 19:14.080]  This is an internal globalist
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.240]  Separation of power power struggle something the founders said would hold back tyranny to a certain extent
[19:19.240 --> 19:23.720]  Because they're always battling with each other like two hyenas over a baby gazelle
[19:23.720 --> 19:27.260]  they've already killed and one's got a leg one's got the neck and they're kind of
[19:27.360 --> 19:33.000]  Pulling it one of them runs in and grabs some guts and drags those off into the bushes eyeballs are hanging out
[19:33.520 --> 19:38.400]  So later and I'm gonna break this down. We're gonna show you the total proof of Google
[19:39.320 --> 19:42.960]  censoring and doing exactly what SOPA does like gang
[19:42.960 --> 19:49.120]  busters on steroids, that's all coming up today, but first the unbelievable
[19:49.800 --> 19:51.680]  Ron Paul
[19:51.680 --> 19:53.680]  censorship election fraud
[19:54.560 --> 19:58.840]  Huge scandal going on right now that is getting almost no attention
[19:58.840 --> 20:00.880]  I mean it's getting covered, but they're not telling you what's happening
[20:00.880 --> 20:04.840]  Did you know that how well your brain works is directly dependent upon how well your gut works
[20:04.880 --> 20:06.880]  Did you know that an inflamed or compromised?
[20:06.880 --> 20:14.400]  Compromised digestive system directly contributes to poor focus depression irritability attention deficit and hyperactivity by eliminating the inflammation
[20:14.600 --> 20:17.680]  In your intestines and by having good bacteria populations
[20:17.680 --> 20:23.680]  You may enjoy better brain function the most important protein your body needs to keep inflammation down is glutathione
[20:23.840 --> 20:30.520]  The number one food to support a dramatic increase in glutathione production is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows
[20:30.760 --> 20:36.120]  Virtually, all whey proteins are damaged by heat filtration and chemicals except one one world
[20:36.120 --> 20:38.880]  Weigh is the most life-giving whey protein on the market
[20:38.880 --> 20:45.280]  It is changing the lives of its users in very positive ways one world way may act as one of the most important health foods

[23:13.440 --> 23:18.720]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television so from outside
[23:18.720 --> 23:23.520]  It looks like someone is home watching TV fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer

[24:42.200 --> 24:44.200]  Just like the Pied Piper
[24:44.200 --> 24:46.200]  You
[24:47.260 --> 24:54.620]  Know if you look at the whole Gingrich thing that Drudge broke before ABC News even announced they were gonna air the interview this
[24:54.620 --> 24:56.380]  evening
[24:56.380 --> 25:00.420]  Yeah, you've got the ex-wife who she had cancer
[25:01.220 --> 25:05.540]  And he came to her and divorced her and then he told one of his top aides
[25:06.060 --> 25:11.900]  Reportedly this has been out for years, but now she's speaking out. Well. She's not good-looking. She's old. She's got cancer
[25:11.900 --> 25:14.820]  I need a young good-looking wife to get elected. I
[25:16.020 --> 25:20.940]  Mean even if you and your wife were getting along when they've got cancer or whatever you take care of them
[25:21.820 --> 25:23.820]  And it just shows this is a demon
[25:24.460 --> 25:26.580]  this is a demon and
[25:27.460 --> 25:31.880]  Then he's got this new wife, and she buys like a half million dollars with the jewelry every few months
[25:31.880 --> 25:35.340]  I mean, it's just and he writes books about being frugal
[25:35.700 --> 25:36.940]  That's the thing
[25:36.940 --> 25:42.020]  Do you want to buy a half million dollars worth of jewelry every few months for your wife to keep her happy because it's all
[25:42.020 --> 25:44.780]  This lobbyist money you got selling America out well
[25:44.780 --> 25:45.900]  That's one thing traitor
[25:45.900 --> 25:52.680]  But to write books about it being frugal and all this garbage when you're a little pimp who likes glitter bug stuff
[25:53.220 --> 25:56.860]  And most these global is that's how they are they're into just petty junk
[25:57.260 --> 26:00.940]  These are such empty little chicken neck jellyfish
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.740]  And again, I'm not saying things are bad comfort security
[26:05.740 --> 26:08.140]  You know being able to travel
[26:09.060 --> 26:10.660]  certainly
[26:10.660 --> 26:12.660]  access to good medical care
[26:12.940 --> 26:16.260]  But it's always so many of the nouveau riche and others
[26:16.260 --> 26:24.120]  They're just into the baubles and they worship the baubles, and it just shows how empty these people will sell their souls
[26:24.580 --> 26:26.580]  They'll just fall down for money
[26:27.020 --> 26:30.220]  Just fall over themselves to climb the globalist ladder
[26:31.860 --> 26:33.700]  Okay
[26:33.700 --> 26:38.460]  Coming up Ron Paul introduces legislation to strike NDAA's police state provisions huge news
[26:38.740 --> 26:43.740]  The latest on SOPA in deep trouble Rand Paul vows to block internet censorship bills
[26:44.580 --> 26:47.740]  Big economic news that's all coming up
[26:47.740 --> 26:54.500]  And of course in the next hour the father of the free software movement is going to be joining us to get into SOPA
[26:54.860 --> 26:56.860]  and a lot more
[26:57.220 --> 27:01.260]  But right now let me start getting into this. This is so big
[27:01.260 --> 27:04.180]  That when I learned this this morning
[27:04.180 --> 27:09.640]  I had Kurt Nemo in here and I was talking to him about writing an article and we were almost flummoxed by how
[27:09.980 --> 27:15.860]  Insane it is how big it is and how it's just being reported like they're talking about
[27:16.300 --> 27:21.420]  The price of a canned ham at Safeway. I mean, it's like they're just mumbling
[27:21.420 --> 27:27.120]  Oh, yeah, and you can get some tires for this. All right, the weather was this I'm kind of hot and balmy
[27:27.120 --> 27:33.760]  Yeah, because I'm listening to local Fox News on local radio. I'm watching TV. I've got stacks of the news and
[27:34.520 --> 27:36.920]  Something's missing in this news. I'm about to cover
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.760]  the name
[27:39.760 --> 27:41.760]  Ron Paul
[27:42.640 --> 27:47.360]  And it was hiding in plain view that's why I get angry I'm in here listening to this watching this going
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.280]  Okay, Rick Perry's dropped out. Okay, he's endorsing
[27:51.060 --> 27:54.380]  The globalist mr. Carbon tax again rich
[27:54.380 --> 27:56.380]  Mr. New World Order
[27:57.460 --> 28:00.060]  Okay, they're now saying Santorum won
[28:00.900 --> 28:02.980]  Iowa and I was the big news folks
[28:04.220 --> 28:06.220]  Santorum won, Iowa
[28:07.140 --> 28:14.380]  But they're saying the results can't be used because there were so many problems and and trucks lost full of the ballots
[28:14.380 --> 28:20.980]  The ballots are called in folks and there was a gentleman agreement to give Santorum more votes two weeks ago
[28:20.980 --> 28:24.240]  When all this happened, I mean remember all that stuff we covered
[28:25.060 --> 28:28.460]  So that we knew there was fraud then I told you two weeks ago. I
[28:29.940 --> 28:32.240]  Told you it was gonna be fraud days before
[28:33.060 --> 28:35.580]  And we had Wayne Paul on Ron Paul's brother
[28:35.580 --> 28:40.320]  In fact, let's get Wayne Paul back on the last 30 minutes today if he can do it or if not tomorrow Sunday
[28:40.320 --> 28:42.320]  I want to get his take on this and
[28:42.620 --> 28:47.380]  Then Wayne sent some stuff to the campaign and they said oh no, we don't see any evidence of fraud in, Iowa
[28:47.380 --> 28:52.820]  you know a day and a half out we'll see what happens is because they want to take the high road because the media will make
[28:52.820 --> 28:54.820]  them look like sore losers
[28:55.260 --> 28:56.860]  And I'm not beating around the bush here
[28:56.860 --> 29:02.220]  I'm letting you know how our thought processes work because it's important to understand how even the info wars
[29:02.540 --> 29:06.980]  Operation doesn't see things that are so naked that are so in plain view
[29:07.980 --> 29:14.260]  But but but simply put Nemo's got an article coming out very soon info wars calm and nobody else is reporting this
[29:14.260 --> 29:17.060]  But I'm about to tell you that
[29:18.220 --> 29:22.260]  They're saying, Iowa results can't be trusted. They're up in the air
[29:22.900 --> 29:26.820]  The news there is reporting final Iowa tally give Santorum edge over Romney
[29:26.820 --> 29:33.020]  No winner declared because results from eight of the state's nearly 1,800 precincts are missing
[29:33.420 --> 29:37.540]  Now we told you this the day it happened the night after and we were cooks for saying it
[29:37.900 --> 29:41.500]  But in here, they're still saying we'll just give it to Santorum
[29:41.500 --> 29:49.100]  And there's no discussion of Ron Paul getting any delegates. I mean this is big they may try to steal his Iowa delegates
[29:49.900 --> 29:53.100]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run

[32:45.080 --> 32:50.640]  Unparallel quality our defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.240]  So you can ride all day with confidence order yours at gusset comm
[32:55.240 --> 33:07.800]  Diamond gusset jeans got it others don't you?
[33:25.240 --> 33:27.240]  Oh
[33:33.680 --> 33:35.320]  Okay, so
[33:35.320 --> 33:37.320]  Here we are
[33:37.320 --> 33:42.000]  and we told everybody up front that there was clear evidence of
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.320]  Missing ballots in Iowa, and I mean everybody said if Ron Paul's gonna get a fair shake anywhere
[33:49.320 --> 33:51.320]  It's gonna be Iowa because you've got
[33:51.840 --> 33:53.840]  the
[33:53.840 --> 33:55.400]  100 precincts
[33:55.400 --> 34:01.600]  Everybody raises their hand you publicly count them up in front of everybody and then a phone call is made
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.000]  To the central counting office and then those numbers are all published and it's all transparent
[34:07.880 --> 34:10.400]  Instead in some areas they counted them in secret
[34:10.920 --> 34:17.120]  they would call in the numbers, but then later say oh, we didn't get the call drive them to this location and
[34:17.120 --> 34:22.840]  Then people would just disappear or they wouldn't be called in
[34:24.440 --> 34:26.440]  All of this went on
[34:29.640 --> 34:34.480]  So we then found the clip on Fox News of
[34:38.840 --> 34:43.320]  The guy who was the architect of so much of the election manipulation in 2000
[34:43.320 --> 34:49.560]  You can't deny that it's not that I'm for Al Gore either. It's like, you know two choices of the same poison, but
[34:51.640 --> 34:58.380]  Karl Rove is clearly a scamster. He's been caught many times doing different types of you know, dirty deeds done dirt cheap
[34:59.480 --> 35:01.720]  And he comes out on Fox News as well
[35:01.720 --> 35:06.680]  there were some precincts that came up missing so they just got in a room together as gentlemen and
[35:07.320 --> 35:10.700]  Decided to give Santorum more points to put him in the second place, basically
[35:10.700 --> 35:13.860]  Well now weeks later
[35:15.180 --> 35:20.860]  They just come out like it's no big deal and say the results are in question. We don't know what we're gonna do
[35:22.180 --> 35:28.260]  More delegates will probably go to Santorum now and the rest to Mitt Romney. It looks like that
[35:29.620 --> 35:33.980]  Santorum really won, but it's all in question, but he won and then no
[35:33.980 --> 35:40.340]  discussion in over a dozen news articles national and local about it
[35:40.340 --> 35:45.780]  Ron Paul's not mentioned and I was shown an article a couple days ago by Rob do here who runs the nightly news
[35:45.780 --> 35:47.420]  It was the LA Times
[35:47.420 --> 35:53.540]  Admitting that they made the decision six months ago to not mention Ron Paul and to act like he can't win
[35:54.080 --> 36:00.680]  Because they've decided he isn't a real candidate. They have decided and he's in second place in most states
[36:01.020 --> 36:03.420]  He's the only guy that's a constitutionalist
[36:03.420 --> 36:06.620]  He in polls he's the best against Obama
[36:06.820 --> 36:12.220]  but they have decided to give him 89 seconds in one debate the CBS debate or to
[36:12.220 --> 36:15.920]  Kick him out of another debate or when they talk about him to only be negative
[36:16.340 --> 36:21.140]  There is the arrogance of these people and this is big big big news
[36:22.340 --> 36:29.500]  Finally, Iowa Tally give Santorum edge over Romney no winner declared news 14
[36:29.500 --> 36:31.500]  The
[36:32.780 --> 36:36.540]  Final results of the Iowa caucuses are in and there's a chance and
[36:37.140 --> 36:41.820]  A change at the top Rick Santorum edge Mitt Romney by 34 votes
[36:42.500 --> 36:47.020]  Romney had been considered the winner after initial tallies gave him an eight-vote advantage
[36:47.660 --> 36:54.620]  Despite the surprise flip Iowa's Republican Party is not naming an official winner because results from eight of the state's nearly
[36:55.260 --> 36:57.260]  1800 precincts are missing
[36:57.260 --> 37:02.240]  The college towns the Ron Paul supporter areas Eames and other areas
[37:03.540 --> 37:06.620]  GOP or Ames, excuse me GOP chairman
[37:07.420 --> 37:08.740]  Matt
[37:08.740 --> 37:10.700]  strong
[37:10.700 --> 37:12.700]  says he's
[37:12.900 --> 37:18.140]  Congratulating both Santorum and Romney as he did the day after the Iowa caucuses
[37:18.140 --> 37:26.140]  As strong describes it as the closest contest in caucus history. Now, there's no mention here of Ron Paul
[37:29.580 --> 37:31.580]  The article goes on
[37:35.780 --> 37:41.740]  For page after page I have the news articles here and there's no mention of
[37:42.340 --> 37:45.500]  Ron Paul because they're lying by omission
[37:45.500 --> 37:47.500]  Here's another one a
[37:48.020 --> 37:51.020]  Register-exclusive 2012 GOP caucus count
[37:51.660 --> 37:58.380]  unresolved Des Moines register and look at this if you go pull this article up or if you're watching us on prison planet
[37:58.380 --> 38:00.380]  TV right now. Look at it
[38:02.540 --> 38:10.060]  It has the results and it mentions no one but Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney
[38:11.820 --> 38:13.940]  Gee we'd like to know what happened with Ron Paul
[38:13.940 --> 38:16.740]  We'd like to know what happened with Ron Paul. It was just a few points behind
[38:16.900 --> 38:22.460]  We'd like to at least hear about him. There is no telling what they are doing here
[38:22.740 --> 38:29.100]  Here's another one final Iowa Telegis and Toram edge over Romney because of missing votes. No winner declared
[38:29.940 --> 38:35.920]  The votes remain missing two weeks after events. So you've got the college towns missing
[38:36.460 --> 38:41.740]  The places where Ron Paul was polling in in giant double digits that would have pushed him over
[38:41.740 --> 38:46.300]  Sorry, some of the most populated areas where Ron Paul was dominating
[38:47.540 --> 38:49.340]  like Ames
[38:49.340 --> 38:50.700]  gone
[38:50.700 --> 38:51.980]  gone
[38:51.980 --> 38:57.700]  Gone and Karl Rove says well, you know, they they all met behind closed doors some of the election officials
[38:57.700 --> 39:03.420]  He won't mention who and they met with Santorum and Romney and they made a gentleman's agreement. I'm glad that
[39:04.340 --> 39:10.180]  They knew these votes were missing at like five o'clock at night and that they just said well, there was a gentleman's agreement
[39:10.180 --> 39:12.180]  That's the way it is
[39:14.060 --> 39:16.580]  So that's the new America
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.020]  Here's another one breaking Perry obviously drops out a presidential race
[39:22.060 --> 39:23.540]  endorses
[39:23.540 --> 39:27.280]  nudie ganrich and guess who else endorsed nudie ganrich
[39:28.100 --> 39:30.100]  Sarah Palin
[39:30.340 --> 39:32.820]  If you ever wanted to know about cutesy
[39:33.840 --> 39:36.420]  Little miss cutesy little miss beauty queen
[39:36.420 --> 39:43.060]  If you ever wanted to know what she's doing when she's not chasing professional athletes around
[39:44.060 --> 39:47.260]  If you ever wanted to know what what what she's up to
[39:48.580 --> 39:56.340]  Well, you now know endorsing a guy who's known to leave his wife while she's fighting cancer and to brag about hell
[39:56.340 --> 39:58.620]  Well, I gotta have me a hot cutie to get elected
[39:59.740 --> 40:01.900]  Just cold-blooded snake
[40:01.900 --> 40:07.380]  Right out of the pit of hell who supports carbon taxes open borders socialist health care
[40:08.380 --> 40:13.900]  Gun control in the past abortion all of it and don't send me emails. Well, he doesn't support that stuff now
[40:14.540 --> 40:16.540]  Well, yeah, cuz he's lying to you
[40:16.780 --> 40:22.940]  When I can play eclipse all day Mitt Romney how great abortion is, but now he's telling you, you know how horrible it is
[40:22.940 --> 40:27.420]  I mean, they'll lie to you and if you turn your back on them, they'll stick a knife in you
[40:27.420 --> 40:29.940]  In fact, they'll stick a knife in you and tell you they're giving you a rose
[40:29.940 --> 40:35.300]  And now it's coming out Newt Genrich was exposed yesterday on the Drudge report who broke that
[40:35.860 --> 40:41.380]  ABC News was having an internal debate over airing it but it decided to air it on the eve
[40:41.940 --> 40:44.260]  Just a few days before the South Carolina
[40:45.460 --> 40:47.460]  primary
[40:47.700 --> 40:52.900]  And now ABC after being scooped to their own story has come out
[40:53.940 --> 40:55.940]  And confirm what Drudge is reporting
[40:55.940 --> 40:59.220]  And that is the way well, you can read the quotes
[41:00.100 --> 41:02.500]  There was a civil war inside the network over it
[41:03.540 --> 41:06.420]  and now that's been confirmed by ABC and
[41:07.060 --> 41:13.220]  She's gonna come out and talk about how he said look I'm leaving you, you know, you're you're not good-looking you got cancer
[41:13.620 --> 41:17.060]  I need me a young trophy and they've got reportedly
[41:17.940 --> 41:22.180]  Prominent aides and others saying yeah, he just was cold-blooded. They're like, why are you leaving your wife?
[41:22.180 --> 41:26.740]  That won't be a good political and he's like look I need me a pretty young thing for the voters
[41:27.140 --> 41:30.020]  And you know what a lot of the voters are shallow enough and evil enough
[41:31.620 --> 41:34.820]  That I mean there's nothing better and I'm not here judging people that
[41:35.380 --> 41:40.180]  You know have divorces or whatever but it's the way Genrich did it then to see Ron Paul up there with his
[41:40.580 --> 41:43.780]  With his cute old wife, you know grandma bake you the cookies, you know
[41:43.780 --> 41:46.980]  She's had heart problems and stuff follows him around the campaign trail
[41:47.380 --> 41:51.460]  Sticking with his girlfriend and saying, you know what? I'm gonna get you a trophy
[41:51.460 --> 41:56.740]  Sticking with his lady for over 50 years and all his children, you know, that's a life well led
[41:57.300 --> 41:59.060]  That's a good thing
[41:59.060 --> 42:01.940]  You say what you want about Mitt Romney. At least he's got the same wife and kids
[42:02.580 --> 42:06.580]  Newt Genrich, I mean if you can't stay with your wife, that's one thing
[42:06.740 --> 42:11.140]  But if you're running around from wife to wife to wife and your ex-wives hate you enough
[42:11.620 --> 42:14.980]  To go on tv and talk about you. You're a nasty person
[42:14.980 --> 42:21.380]  But again, that's not why I'd vote against Genrich. That's bad enough
[42:21.380 --> 42:23.380]  It shows the type of person he is
[42:23.940 --> 42:25.940]  the issue here
[42:26.420 --> 42:32.260]  Is that he's a globalist i've read you his quotes where he calls for putting microchips in people don't believe
[42:32.260 --> 42:38.180]  Just type in newt. Genrich calls for putting microchips in population. He wrote stinking articles about it 20 years ago
[42:39.140 --> 42:42.100]  He calls for the end of the family. He calls for global government
[42:42.100 --> 42:45.720]  I mean, there's a reason the new world order picked him out of a nowhere university
[42:46.740 --> 42:52.760]  And put him where he is because he's a nasty little globalist part of this luciferian futurist society
[42:53.060 --> 42:55.060]  If you don't believe me just go look it up
[42:56.740 --> 42:58.740]  Tell you he's a nasty one
[42:58.980 --> 43:01.880]  He is a nasty nasty nasty
[43:02.580 --> 43:05.380]  Little creature. All right. I'm done talking about newt. Genrich
[43:05.380 --> 43:11.700]  Now mitt romney may not leave wives who've got cancer and you know get him a new hot young thing, but
[43:12.340 --> 43:19.620]  Mitt romney is for carbon taxes abortion gun control open borders. I'm talking about his voting record not his rhetoric
[43:20.740 --> 43:24.580]  And uh you conservatives out there that want to vote for the pretty boy
[43:26.500 --> 43:31.780]  You did the same thing with obama sharp slick well-spoken reading on the teleprompter like mitt romney
[43:32.340 --> 43:34.340]  You you vote for these kin dolls
[43:34.340 --> 43:36.580]  because the only difference is
[43:38.580 --> 43:41.300]  What three thousand dollar suit they're wearing or what color tie
[43:41.940 --> 43:43.220]  and
[43:43.220 --> 43:45.220]  What is before their name rrd?
[43:45.780 --> 43:50.420]  That's why the system is totally I mean there was an article yesterday where in fact guys pull this up
[43:51.220 --> 43:53.220]  one of the new top officials
[43:54.100 --> 43:55.780]  in the
[43:55.780 --> 43:58.820]  Obama administration is the other former head of bain capital
[43:58.820 --> 44:03.700]  Started and set up and run and and he still owns a big part of it by mitt romney. It's come out today
[44:04.020 --> 44:09.540]  That he's got that he pays 15 percent tax on average when blue-collar workers pay more than that
[44:11.780 --> 44:14.340]  People are like, what do you mean that they tell me people that making you know
[44:15.940 --> 44:21.640]  Working sums don't don't pay taxes bull you pay the social security you pay the fica you pay the unemployment
[44:21.860 --> 44:27.460]  You pay all the other taxes. Do you know this lie that half the public doesn't pay taxes? That's a lie
[44:27.460 --> 44:29.460]  That's a lie
[44:29.460 --> 44:32.740]  It's about 25 of the public who's not retired
[44:33.380 --> 44:35.380]  Doesn't pay income tax
[44:36.260 --> 44:42.520]  But you pay all the other federal taxes that are there you pay that gas tax you pay the cell phone telecommunications
[44:43.060 --> 44:48.740]  Taxes you pay when you fly on an airplane a a a a security fee to be groped now
[44:48.740 --> 44:54.440]  They're saying for buses and trains. They're going to start a security fee. The feds are talking about a new fee on gasoline
[44:54.440 --> 45:01.160]  So they can set up checkpoints and feel your wife's and your genitals and i'm sorry to talk about these subjects, but it's going on
[45:03.320 --> 45:09.160]  People get upset about talking about what tsa does let's talk about what they're doing, you know, I got to define what they're doing
[45:13.800 --> 45:16.200]  This is the type of stuff that is going on
[45:18.760 --> 45:23.080]  All right, i've i've covered the iowa situation it's it's it's just
[45:23.080 --> 45:25.400]  It's it's it's just no discussion of paul
[45:26.120 --> 45:28.840]  And uh, okay. The election was a fraud
[45:31.480 --> 45:35.960]  But uh all of this is going on and there's just no discussion of ron paul
[45:35.960 --> 45:41.960]  You just don't even need to know where he is in the new tabulation that they admits a fraud and we do have ron paul's brother
[45:42.600 --> 45:43.640]  uh
[45:43.640 --> 45:45.640]  Chip off the old block his younger brother
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.600]  Who's been for 40 something years fighting the globalists out protesting the fed?
[45:50.600 --> 45:55.640]  Sue in the irs. I mean you talk about a real activist. I know the paul family folks
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.580]  I know all the I know the whole deal and they are basically
[46:01.620 --> 46:03.620]  Prototypes of alex jones
[46:04.200 --> 46:06.200]  They're basically g edward griffins
[46:06.840 --> 46:09.420]  I mean that's about they're they're basically bob shatmans
[46:10.200 --> 46:12.200]  I mean, that's who they are
[46:13.480 --> 46:17.000]  One brother ran for congress to fight the new world order and here he is today
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.400]  I wish more people would have run for congress about the new world order. I guess larry mcdonald did and they killed him better than hammer
[46:24.600 --> 46:31.800]  I guess senator hanson did and they arrested him on income tax evasion which turned out to be a fraud and tortured him nearly to death
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.800]  You ever seen the interviews with him? So obviously I was looking for those on youtube. They're not on there
[46:35.960 --> 46:40.280]  I must predate that he's in some john birch society documentaries and stuff congressman hanson
[46:40.680 --> 46:43.240]  I mean they drove him around for something like eight months or something
[46:43.240 --> 46:47.000]  In an 18 wheeler till his feet all busted like something out of a horror movie
[46:48.200 --> 46:50.200]  you know till he had um
[46:50.760 --> 46:55.960]  I want to get into it, but you know what sitting down does to your hind end for eight months
[46:56.760 --> 46:58.440]  Probably it's torture
[46:58.440 --> 46:59.880]  chained
[46:59.880 --> 47:01.720]  They call it dieseling
[47:01.720 --> 47:06.520]  And uh, they uh, they uh, they taught him so I guess there have been folks that came
[47:08.200 --> 47:10.360]  Before ron paul and you know what happened to them
[47:10.360 --> 47:12.360]  so, uh, uh
[47:12.360 --> 47:15.000]  You know, we stand on the shoulders of a lot of dead bodies
[47:15.560 --> 47:21.000]  You need to remember that a lot of people gave their lives their treasure their homes their children
[47:21.800 --> 47:23.800]  So that you would know about this
[47:24.040 --> 47:25.640]  Take the limberg
[47:25.640 --> 47:26.840]  Uh, the limbergs and mr
[47:26.840 --> 47:31.400]  limberg and congress was speaking out against the federal reserve and it's come out that they basically just
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.840]  Rapped his kid killed it and set up a patsy. I mean they don't play games ladies and gentlemen
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.920]  A new order doesn't play games. We're going to get uh, wayne paul to pop in for about 20 minutes
[47:41.320 --> 47:44.360]  Uh to get his take on what's happening with his brother
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.320]  Because obviously ron paul is going to take the high road on all this because they would crucify him. It's admitted fraud in, iowa
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.960]  It was but he's like well, we did third place. We did pretty good. That's respectable
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.280]  Yeah, second place in new hampshire. That was fraud there. We got evidence of that
[48:01.320 --> 48:03.320]  Truth is ron paul's hotter than a pistol
[48:03.320 --> 48:10.360]  He is hotter than the than the sun right now and he is the real front-runner and they're just doing every bit of spin
[48:10.360 --> 48:12.360]  They can so you don't understand that
[48:12.920 --> 48:19.560]  The last domino to fall is for us to realize that he is really the front-runner. He's been the front-runner the whole time
[48:20.680 --> 48:22.680]  I remember back in 2007
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.720]  And eight when he was running for for a president when he was in new hampshire
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.560]  He would go on local college radio and access t-shirts
[48:31.560 --> 48:33.560]  college radio and access tv
[48:34.040 --> 48:38.120]  Because the media would not even give him attention and he was getting
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.640]  Pretty good numbers in those states and they should have been they were giving people less numbers more attention this time
[48:44.280 --> 48:50.200]  They ignored him for six months or so, but the dam broke they got discredited the heat got so hot on they said, okay
[48:50.200 --> 48:52.200]  We'll stop ignoring him
[48:52.680 --> 48:57.480]  Call out the fake ku klux klan groups call out people making fun of asians attributed it all to him
[48:57.480 --> 49:03.160]  Uh, you know go through, you know, 20 years of newsletters and and find the supplements that a company
[49:03.160 --> 49:07.240]  They hired to promote the newsletters wrote don't tell the public that eight out of ten of these passages
[49:07.400 --> 49:11.480]  Are out of supplements and it's just mild stuff kind of extreme right-wing stuff
[49:11.880 --> 49:17.000]  Uh, you know, never mind the fact it's on record that he only wrote the financial section of it and had 14 published at one time
[49:17.400 --> 49:21.720]  You know every every week coming out just just say he hates black people
[49:21.720 --> 49:27.800]  I mean after all they said rand kidnapped women worshiped buddha secretly under water wasn't a doctor
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.040]  Uh, there's a bunch of other craziness they had people dress up and
[49:34.440 --> 49:40.040]  Overalls and john deere hats literally and run around with signs talking about about black people and hispanics
[49:40.040 --> 49:43.480]  I mean, they're going to pull out every stinking trick they've got
[49:44.120 --> 49:46.120]  Because we forced them to cover them
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.600]  All we've got to do is get on the field and it's over
[49:51.320 --> 49:56.280]  And i'll say it again people are like well, they'll probably still just steal it and we'll expose that they're stealing it and just credit them
[49:56.280 --> 50:00.440]  More, but he'll be there covering real issues. That's why we've got to go all in
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.720]  If ron paul doesn't get the nomination folks, and I know he probably won't run third party if he did
[50:06.600 --> 50:08.280]  He would just be there
[50:08.280 --> 50:13.080]  Forcing his way into the debate and forcing his way into the stage demonstration
[50:13.080 --> 50:18.760]  The debate and forcing his way into the staged event the theater of mittens romney
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.580]  And barack the sheep herder obama with you know, I mean both these guys

[55:11.420 --> 55:16.780]  because we've been listening to that for about a year we go back and forth we got to reintroduce the Bob Marley in the morning for a while
[55:16.780 --> 55:23.980]  because that is some good stuff some good breakfast kind of listening we kind of go back and forth between
[55:23.980 --> 55:29.980]  classical reggae and country old fat but we tend to get stuck on the country in my house
[55:29.980 --> 55:36.220]  but I don't know that Bob Marley's a good good second or maybe even first place I don't know
[55:36.860 --> 55:40.780]  okay in fact I'm gonna ask my wife I'm gonna say you were the iPod controller just because you
[55:40.780 --> 55:43.580]  you always turn it on first can we go back to the Bob Marley for a while
[55:45.180 --> 55:51.420]  okay I am digressing I am digressing here right now it's just good poetry folks you gotta love it

[55:58.780 --> 56:09.660]  the meaning the things wow both of these are good news uh Rand Paul vows to block internet
[56:09.660 --> 56:17.180]  censorship bills who else is fighting tyranny in congress SOPA and PIPA are threat to free speech
[56:17.180 --> 56:22.860]  Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul has promised to do everything within his power to ensure the
[56:22.860 --> 56:29.820]  draconian IP act and the stop online privacy act are not brought to a vote Paul says he will
[56:29.820 --> 56:34.940]  filibuster the PIPA in the senate owing to the fact that the bill is a direct threat to the
[56:34.940 --> 56:42.940]  first amendment and he goes over that and they're also backing off of it from for now just so
[56:42.940 --> 56:47.820]  opposition kind of backs off and and and people say well they'll just come back later that's why
[56:47.820 --> 56:52.380]  we got to stay on them you don't like go out on the field and fight the tyrants and they run off
[56:52.380 --> 56:57.340]  and they know well they ran off they're going to come back like cockroaches you've got to keep the
[56:57.340 --> 57:01.900]  pressure on them that's how you win a war for liberty for freedom for anything that's why the
[57:01.900 --> 57:06.940]  globalist always pressure and when they don't find resistance they back off as soon as we don't
[57:06.940 --> 57:13.180]  resist they push back again people are like gee we got to fight all the time liberty is an eternal
[57:13.180 --> 57:18.940]  fight raising your kids right is an eternal fight getting up in the morning it just happens over and
[57:18.940 --> 57:24.220]  over again people think everything's just supposed to be easy the truth is it's fun to fight tyrants
[57:24.220 --> 57:30.060]  you've got to make it a game when you realize how much fun it is to route these people we can
[57:30.060 --> 57:34.940]  really route the daylights out of them the problem is if we really run them back in their holes for
[57:35.500 --> 57:40.940]  for a long period you know drive them underground for a long time we'll get so much prosperity
[57:42.380 --> 57:46.860]  like we did before that we'll get laughed at by our grandkids about caring about freedom
[57:46.860 --> 57:52.220]  when we save their hind ends if we're able to do it that's the problem when you give
[57:52.220 --> 57:57.020]  people liberty they only appreciate it for a generation or so and that's the problem
[57:57.020 --> 58:02.300]  you don't want tyranny but when you defeat it for a while everybody kind of forgets
[58:04.380 --> 58:07.820]  and then the criminals creep back in and are careful about it
[58:07.820 --> 58:11.340]  and the criminals kind of got wild for a while that's why they're really in trouble

[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:51.580]  senator ted stevens who thought the internet was a bunch of tubes that physical mail was delivered
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:01:00.460]  on he's now gone off to valhalla so that's coming up we've got breaking news up at infowars.com if

[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:19.900]  using sopa-like censorship and i want to point that out that it's happening to us it's happening
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:24.940]  to others and it's certified and the proof is all there this is a big deal the power structure is
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:29.500]  fighting with itself right now and basically wants google to be able to censor people not
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.420]  the government but google's already doing it we've got the proof right there i'm going to cover that
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:39.100]  coming up later in the hour but we need to get this article out to everyone google is already
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:44.860]  using sopa-like censorship and it's got all the proof and guess who one of the main big fat
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:51.340]  targets is infowars.com and prisonplanet.com gee i wonder why because they're growing exponentially
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:56.780]  like insane gangbusters thanks to you the listeners and others out there people like
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.100]  matt drudge who links to us routinely because you know he's a real researcher and journalist
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:06.780]  understands we're breaking a lot of news so there it is right there and we're swimming upstream just
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:12.540]  like ron paul they're trying to black us out they're trying to censor us all this is going on
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.780]  and the article proves it all we'll be breaking it down later we're also going to premiere a video
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:23.500]  here that deals with the fact that we are winning viral video resistance is victory the tide is
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.140]  turning and of course i shot this video a few days ago aaron did an incredible job adding all
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:33.900]  the documents there's one error in the video thanks to me i said they want they want to make
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:40.300]  us use fluorescent headache inducing light bulbs instead of the beautiful phosphorescent when after
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:46.540]  i watched the video i said it's incandescent is what they're banning phosphorescent is a subgroup
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:54.540]  which is like dayglo green uh or a jellyfish glow with of fluorescent but it doesn't matter it just
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.420]  when i find mistakes you better believe i'm going to tell you when i make them because i know
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:05.740]  incandescent is the difference between the the you know you got halogen you got incandescent
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:11.180]  you've got uh all the different types of fluorescent and i know that but i don't even but
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:17.260]  then i i i correct it and it's almost even pointless but i'm gonna correct it i can't change
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.740]  the video though but it's a very small point no one even noticed it in the comments but i did
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:27.820]  viral video resistance is victory it's up at infowars.com the tide is turning the video is there
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.740]  for all the radio listeners but i'm going to premiere the audio and video here coming up at the
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:38.940]  bottom of the hour and there's now been a new supreme court ruling supreme court rules congress

[01:03:53.980 --> 01:04:00.140]  hearing about this case i guess they did it so i guess they can take oliver twist or they can take
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.380]  tale of two cities stuff that's been or i guess they can take the little mermaid
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.620]  hans christiansen or whatever his name is and i guess they can just recopyright it and give it
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:15.340]  to whoever they want unbelievable attack on the free flow of information because they always use

[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.460]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how much
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:17.740]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:22.860]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:28.380]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:33.580]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.140]  families lose their power from weather related images number five a solar power generator

[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:12.300]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:24.060]  okay my friends we've got a real treat for you uh there's uh they talk about the top 10 people
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:30.060]  out there and internet land and who've really changed you know our perspective on so many
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.180]  things it's dr richard stallman he's a software developer and software freedom activist he
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.580]  graduated from harvard in 74 with a ba in physics and received many awards doctorates
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:46.060]  and professorships for extensive work in january of 84 he resigned from mit to start the gnu
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:52.460]  operating system or gnu meant to be entirely free software and has been the project leader
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:58.380]  ever since dr stallman also launched the free software movement in october of 85 he started
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.260]  the free software foundation and thank god because nothing would work if we were running off microsoft
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.900]  still and i don't know anything about internet i know that and in 1999 stallman called for
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:14.780]  development of free online encyclopedia through the means of in inviting the public to contribute
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:20.460]  articles so he was the presenter of wikipedia during his college years he also worked as a
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:26.300]  staff hacker at the mit artificial intelligence lab learning operating system development by
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:33.500]  doing it stallman pioneered the concept of copy left and is the main author of the gnu general
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.300]  public license the most widely used free software license this is why since the mid-90s stallman
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:44.140]  has spent most of his time in political advocacy for free software and spreading the ethical ideas
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:49.180]  of the movement as well as campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extensions
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:54.540]  of copyright laws that's why he's probably the best guest we can get on uh you know to discuss
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:10:00.380]  russia china the us they're all using copyright and later admitting they're using it to shut down
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:06.300]  free speech sopa is just one manifestation of this and this monster is receding for now but
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.780]  it's guaranteed to come back very soon in fact a few weeks here's the associated press supreme
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:15.260]  court rules congress can recopy right public domain works that have been out for hundreds of
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:23.420]  years this is amazing uh and uh so here to break down the different horrors of the expansion of
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:29.340]  copyright to where you can't even use words now they're saying uh is uh a professor and
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:36.540]  dr stallman thank you for coming on with us sir hello hello uh well let's go over it i mean what
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:42.620]  do you make of what's happening right now well i haven't read any details about today's supreme
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:49.980]  court decision i haven't seen that yet but previously other supreme court decisions said
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:54.780]  it was unconstitutional to recopy right anything that was in the public domain
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:05.500]  uh but this is a very pro-business supreme court we can't trust it to protect human rights they're
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:11.500]  going to give those human rights to corporations and protect the rights of corporations but not
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:20.220]  the rights of humans in any practical sense yes sir um what got you started uh you know developing
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:27.580]  the ideas that have become the free software movement that you kicked off i lived in a free
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:33.500]  software community in the 1970s although we didn't use that term when i was working at
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:40.140]  the artificial intelligence lab at mit it was part of a community where we shared the software
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:46.700]  that we developed and all the software that we used was the software of the community and we
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.660]  were happy to share it with anyone who was interested in it and we hoped that if they
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:57.660]  improved that they would share it back and often they did but this community died in the early 80s
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:05.580]  leaving me face to face with the proprietary software world which is the way everyone else
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:11.980]  was using software and by comparison to the world to the life of freedom that i was used to
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:20.940]  proprietary software was ugly morally ugly so i balked at that i said i am not going to accept
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:28.460]  the life of proprietary software i would be ashamed of my life if i did that so i decided
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:36.060]  to build a new free software community since the old one was based on software for obsolete
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:44.300]  computers it was necessary to start again from scratch so i launched that project and now there
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:54.620]  are free operating systems now it's just barely possible to use computers and not be subjugated
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:01.100]  by software developers of non-free software but expanding that with just basic text copyright
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:05.660]  take right haven they've been absolutely destroyed in court they sued a lot of people
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:14.700]  across the spectrum for even taking a paragraph in a comment board where it was clearly a third
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:20.060]  party that had even done it and they were backed by the associated press and others i mean that is
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:27.900]  really creepy to have the associated press and others actually suing uh you know uh quadriplegics
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:33.180]  and and and and and community activist groups helping homeless people because they had one
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:39.900]  paragraph of their article and clearly were you know discussing in many cases their own they were
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:46.380]  in the news article they were posting it on their blog about them for for humanitarian discussion
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:52.540]  couldn't get any more clear free speech and they were being sued well you know they may
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:59.500]  if if they went to court they might win that is the defendants might win on the grounds of fair
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:05.500]  use the problem is it's hard to tell in advance and it costs you a lot of money to go to court
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:11.900]  and find out so those people probably didn't have enough money to stand up for their what are
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:19.100]  possibly their rights plausibly their rights but because of the way fair use is defined in
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:29.580]  copyright law it's not a clear permission it's a rather vaguely drawn defense against charges
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:37.020]  of copyright infringement case by case shifting gears overall uh specifically on soba is it
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:45.020]  heartening for you to see the big blackouts to see it is and what this means is that we can
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:51.020]  sometimes defeat the copyright lobby when it demands increased power of course we haven't
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:57.500]  defeated them yet we are at least coming close to defeat them to defeating them and maybe we'll
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:05.580]  defeat them but everybody listening to this you've got to phone your senators today because they're
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:13.980]  going to vote next week so but at least even if we don't actually defeat them we've mounted a
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:22.220]  campaign that will have come fairly close this is the first time it's been such a fight when the
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:29.500]  digital millennium copyright act was passed the law that censors software that you can use to
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:38.780]  decode encrypted publications that you could use to break digital handcuffs that was passed in the
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:46.140]  house of representatives without an explicit vote it was considered totally uncontroversial there
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:53.020]  were just a few of us saying that this is an injustice and that's why digital restrictions
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:16:01.420]  management drm is such a pain nowadays because of that law that the copyright lobby purchased in
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:13.820]  1998 which bans the software capable of breaking the digital handcuffs so i am against anything
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:21.740]  that the copyright lobby wants until they start undoing some of the injustices they've already
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:26.140]  imposed on us doctor let me try to quantify that from my layman's perspective and correct me if
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.900]  i'm wrong but but but this is what i mean i see as the injustice they're talking about their rights
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:38.780]  as they attempt to put a preemptive uh non-deliberative no due process guilty until
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:44.220]  proven guilty system guilty until proven innocent i think you meant well i was being sarcastic just
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.340]  just you i mean you're guilty basically period yeah guilty until proven guilty i was being
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:53.580]  sarcastic but yeah but but i mean you're guilty up front and they're basically just gobbling up
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:59.180]  the internet gobbling up what people have created gobbling up everything like they're masters of
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:03.740]  the universe and until they become reasonable there's no point in even discussing anything
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:10.380]  with them because they're not giving anybody quarter i agree but furthermore the sec the
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:18.060]  more subtle things that they're doing is they're trying to focus attention on their problems as if
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:23.580]  their problems needed to be catered to while distracting you away from the problems they
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:33.340]  have already imposed on us i hope we completely defeat soba but don't forget the copyright law in
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:38.860]  the u.s already gives them too much power of course they're not satisfied they always want more
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:46.060]  that's what the one percent due to the 99 percent but even if we stop them from getting more that's
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:51.740]  not enough we've got to aim for more than just preventing them from making it worse we've got
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:18:00.140]  to undo some of the injustices they have already done to us we have to put an end to the war on
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:07.500]  sharing which is a cruel war that attacks all of us now when i say sharing i mean something
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:17.340]  specific i mean non-commercial copying and redistribution of published works exact copies
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:24.220]  that means not modifications that's a rather limited freedom but that's the freedom we all
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:34.620]  must have so that the war on sharing ends and copyright ceases to be tyranny now that means
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:41.180]  i've got to stop using digital handcuffs lots of products nowadays are designed with digital
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:46.780]  handcuffs every dvd player you can buy has digital handcuffs oh let me let me give people
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:53.420]  an example i mean i have a tv studio i have a tv show i make films i buy prosumer and professional
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:19:00.620]  equipment and half of our technical difficulties are with digital tvs monitors cameras is having
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.980]  the right software keys everything talking to each other plugged in it has to authenticate
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:12.460]  that i'm allowed to run a video through it it's all spying on me and screwing up my entire
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:18.380]  operation my whole life is about complying with this stuff and i bought it and i'm in here using
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:24.140]  it to produce tv and and and as the 80 inventors of the internet pointed out this sopa would
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:31.740]  cripple the internet by putting all these pre-restrictions on things well yes the worst
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:39.660]  thing in sopa is that it becomes easy to shut down any website where the public is posting things
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:47.500]  it just takes an accusation that somebody posted something that was infringing copyright and it
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:55.100]  becomes almost impossible for that site to keep operating that's why wikipedia decided to go black
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:01.980]  yesterday because it would be impossible to operate something even vaguely like wikipedia
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:09.740]  under the rules of sopa now after the show's over i'd like you to tell me more about the precise
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:16.460]  details of your problems with these tv systems or have your technical person tell me because
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:21.420]  that's an area i don't know about and i want to know about the details of that sure if you'd like
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:27.500]  that uh uh the doctor actually have two engineers here uh and they can explain it to you but you
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:34.460]  know we have tv sets behind me on the nightly news and they're digital and just to run feeds to them
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:39.820]  to to talk to a guest on skype or to or or or you know to have a blue background behind me
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:46.220]  uh all the tvs you buy that are prosumer or even professional now it has a gate in it that
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:53.740]  scans to see if i'm even streaming something over it that's copyright uh and it and and then it's
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:59.100]  endless you know to use software you've got to have the dongle in the machine and then that
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:04.220]  screws up i mean it's because you're using proprietary software and proprietary you see
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.540]  with software there are just two possibilities either the users control the program or the
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:14.940]  program controls the users what you're seeing is that with proprietary software the software
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:21.580]  controls the users now what's proprietary software that's any software for which the users don't have
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:28.780]  the freedom to run it as they wish study and change the source code and redistribute it either
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:37.660]  with or without changes so uh sure just to be clear doctor troll but with windows or mac os or skype
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:44.300]  the software controls the users that's why i will not use any of that well it is the machine
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.580]  surveilling us preemptively turning us into slaves a lot of our operation is run on linux systems i'm
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:54.220]  not a tech guy but they're not Linux systems they're GNU systems and you're talking about
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:58.540]  my work there you're right you are the progenitor of that with GNU that then other things grew out
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:04.460]  of so GNU systems we do have a lot of those we have a uh one of our uh uh IT people just
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.740]  absolutely loves your workers trying to build a lot of things around here like that but
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.660]  separately when i've got a pretty big operation it's not that big like 34 people you know
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:16.620]  sometimes we've got to hurry we've got to buy software to run tv shows we've got to get
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:22.140]  equipment i'm talking about solid state stuff doc that won't work as well all i'm saying is
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:29.820]  it screws everything up yeah hardware can be malicious too and these uh the encryption of
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:36.220]  video between a computer and the monitor is an example of a malicious hardware feature
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:44.700]  that has been put into uh essentially all modern pc's by a conspiracy of corporations
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:53.900]  including hardware companies and media companies so you know what you can see it they they buy
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:23:00.140]  laws like the digital millennium copyright act to forbid people to escape from these things
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:09.340]  and then they can design our technology to abuse us however they wish so what you can see is that
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:17.340]  proprietary software because the even when there's hardware that's malicious the software has to make
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:24.620]  use of the malicious features so the proprietary software is involved also and when software is
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:32.540]  proprietary it is likely to have malicious features in it to spy to restrict and there are
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:37.820]  even back doors that accept remote commands to do things that's what i was about to get to sir
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:44.060]  we're talking to richard stallman free software uh inventor creator guru obi-wan kenobi type
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:50.140]  uh you know so much of what we live with today uh that is the the the the the only alternative
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:56.620]  to what uh you know the the big uh corporate borg are are oppressing us with uh did come out
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:00.700]  of his ideas but expanding on this doc because when you talk about it that's what i'm saying
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:07.740]  i've tried to get uh the you know the the freer systems and i'm saying in many cases
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:14.140]  it does not exist i don't have the money to hire an army of people uh that are trained in free
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:19.340]  software to be able to even attempt it and and what you said is true there's all these trojan
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:26.060]  horses built into everything and i'm even paying for it and it's junk no matter how expensive
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:32.300]  because the whole thing is tied down with these handcuffs and it just absolutely stifles innovation
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:40.540]  as you said 30 years ago well although it does worse than stifle innovation you see innovation
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:49.740]  innovation is the uh the sacred cow of people who claim that they need to be allowed to restrict us
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:55.660]  they say if they can restrict us they'll do more innovation but innovation can be good or bad
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:07.260]  democracy was once an innovation tyranny was once an innovation so innovation can serve us
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:13.900]  bio weapons were once an innovation innovation will only serve us if we have control over what
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:21.260]  innovations will accept and what innovations will reject so i do not accept innovation as
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:29.980]  sufficiently important to justify taking away our freedom yes i'd like innovation all else being
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:36.700]  equal assuming we have freedom but when somebody argues give up your freedom so we can make more
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:43.660]  innovation that is literally a trojan horse well that's well said but my point is they are i mean
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:49.660]  everybody knows microsoft stuff works horribly because it's all got back door spy systems and
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:54.780]  it's just total crap because excuse my french there because they're because they're obsessed
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:26:04.140]  and control freaks bill gates yep but it's not just microsoft i've got to point out that apple
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:17.260]  is even worse oh yeah and amazon is horrible the amazon swindle an ebook reader has known spy
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:23.580]  features of course it has digital handcuffs and it has a back door for deleting books
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:32.540]  do you know that amazon remotely deleted thousands of books in 2009 yeah 1984 right
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:40.460]  so someone wrote they used up a year's supply of irony demonstrating the orwellian nature of their
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:46.300]  product which they call the kindle because it's designed to burn our books but they demonstrated
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:53.260]  it by deleting orwell's book oh that's another point they've got this kaza thing where i've had
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:59.340]  rights to music i've uploaded it but because it's in some registrar suddenly it shuts down the audio
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:04.060]  on my videos that millions of people are watching and even though i have letters sending them to
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:08.940]  youtube that i have licensed here it doesn't matter because the computer recognized it and
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:15.180]  did that and they now admit they could erase my voice off these major systems in a matter of hours
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.980]  with the same technology i mean you talk about dangerous having all the books digital they could
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:30.220]  just hit a button that's why i won't use such systems i will never use anything like the amazon
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:38.460]  kindle for my books because i want to have books that i can read without any proprietary technology
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:47.020]  i want to buy them without identifying myself and i'm not willing to sign a contract to get them
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:54.620]  if i buy a paper book i could do it with cash in a bookstore i don't sign a contract and my eyes
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:28:01.740]  without any aid at all or at most perhaps with some lenses can see the letters i'm not required
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:08.540]  to get some secret technology just to see what the letters in the book are wow so uh i will never
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:15.020]  use those ebooks under circumstances and i hope the rest of you will join me if you want to read
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:24.460]  more about this look at stallman dot org slash articles slash ebooks dot pdf and at the bottom
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:32.700]  of that there is a link to a place you can sign up for to participate in our campaign against
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:41.340]  tyrannical ebook systems i mean i had read some of your writings on this but the way you put it
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:46.380]  the way you put it we can really see it being put into function i mean this is a tyranny they've
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:54.620]  designed the current uh web system as a tyranny consciously as you said the big corporations and
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:29:00.140]  the sick part is when we pay the licenses and buy the equipment we're paying for their own trojan
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.580]  horse for them to engage in beyond orwellian behavior yep and that's well i wouldn't say
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:15.900]  beyond orwellian after all uh oceania did things even worse than destroying books and they they
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:24.380]  just murdered people uh but the point is we have to reject these systems and that's the basic idea
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:29.900]  of the free software movement i won't accept the systems that are designed to take away my freedom
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:34.700]  okay doctor uh i'm gonna try to get you in touch right now with one of the engineers to give you
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:39.020]  any of that information you want uh but uh and i'll say bye to you during the break perhaps you
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:42.620]  can even come back for a couple more minutes on the other side and tell us more about solutions
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:47.900]  but just intriguing to hear you on with us and all the points that you bring up it absolutely
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:55.580]  makes sterling sense we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:12.540]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:18.780]  americans at home i have tremendous influence on our president and congress and they really are
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:25.020]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:31.260]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:35.980]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:40.460]  bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do

[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:05.900]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:10.460]  near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:14.940]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:19.820]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:25.500]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it

[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:58.220]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for

[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:15.980]  well richard stallman dr richard stallman free software creator of the gnu system that everything's
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:20.620]  pretty much based on today linux you name it is our guest for five more minutes he's going to be
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:25.100]  gone for a while but hopefully coming up in a few months we'll get him on for a full hour
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:29.980]  because everything he talks about just totally clicks because i'm not an it person but i live
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:35.500]  12 14 hours a day around it we're an internet operation pretty much we're on commercial radio
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:40.700]  as well and xm but i live it and i've experienced what he's talking about and all the points he
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:46.860]  makes ties right in to what i'm just organically seeing as a lay person here but i was in bringing
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:50.540]  up some intriguing stuff to him during the break we have the articles we had the time warner
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:56.700]  executive send us the internal documents after we surmised it an example of these trojan horses
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:02.140]  uh the tivo systems the time warner cable systems and others when they censored the jesse ventura
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:07.020]  tv show it aired once congress went crazy on the fema camps ordered them not to air it again that
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:14.780]  later came out in congress there's a big scandal suddenly off of dvrs nationwide cable systems you
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:19.340]  name it it disappeared we confirmed it through one time warner office that you know that they
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:25.580]  were ordered to put the command in they'd never seen that before but the point is you pay for
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:33.260]  cable you have a dvr you record on it and then they go in and erase it what do you and i know
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.020]  you want to see the proof of that we'll get it to you doctor but if true what do you make of that
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:44.940]  uh it's just another example of how non-free software is a restriction on the users and it's
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:51.180]  an injustice so if you look around at any non-free software you've heard of you know
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:56.700]  various products that have non-free software in them every one of them should not be that way
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.980]  yeah it's it's very very sad this is all going on we're paying for own prison in just three or
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:07.820]  four minutes because i know you've got to go doctor what are some other solutions or things
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:17.020]  we can start doing uh to weaken the power of the corporate uh borg well they're all across
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:24.940]  the various areas of life we can see corporations taking control of our government and using that
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:31.980]  power to hurt most people of course there's the financial crisis and all the americans
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:37.260]  facing foreclosure a lot of these foreclosures are fraudulent the banks are committing fraud
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:44.140]  when they foreclose and right now we're pushing obama not to let them off the hook which is what
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:49.260]  he wants them to do there are a few states where the attorneys general are trying to pursue the
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:56.780]  banksters for their fraudulent foreclosures and there are protests run by move on today i'm going
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:03.900]  to go to one this afternoon but that's just one example of course the banks created the downturn
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:13.180]  by purchasing deregulation in congress and then if we look at for instance uh agribusiness which is
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:21.500]  basically crushed family farming in the u.s and now gets tremendous subsidies to these
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:28.060]  corporations subsidies that were originally meant to help family farmers and that made sense but
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:34.140]  nowadays it's just subsidies to big business and then you look at the the private prison industry
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:40.940]  which is a great reason they they use the prisoners they have the prisoners work but it's
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:46.700]  the company that gets the money the prisoner gets paid like 50 cents a day which is you know even
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:53.100]  better for them than hiring somebody in mexico or china and so that's a reason to imprison more
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:37:00.060]  americans because they're effectively slave labor and then if we look at the oil companies
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:08.940]  and their push for burning up our planet you may have followed the fight to block the keystone xl
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:18.380]  planet roaster pipeline and that's not dead either so what's what you what is it what do these things
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:25.020]  have in common what they have is corporations have power so we need to clean up politics we
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:34.460]  need to get corporate money out of politics and i got a book yesterday let me read the exact title
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:44.300]  it's corporations are not people by jeffrey clement and this proposes a constitutional
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:53.180]  amendment to say that no when the constitution gives rights to people or persons it's not talking
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:38:02.220]  about corporations well the power to give corporations rights so they can then stomp on
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.620]  our rights it's it's it's very very frightening and for those that don't know you couldn't even
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:12.220]  have corporations in this country the way they are until about the last 130 years or so before that
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:17.500]  they had limited duration to build a bridge or to do some type of program and i understand a little
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:22.300]  company having a corporation so you can have different people involved together but the idea
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:27.900]  of giving it more rights than the humans and then and then having these crooks that run it i mean
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.860]  take mit romney he's got most his money in the cayman islands and you know he's running around
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:38.220]  lecturing everybody and he's paying almost no taxes well he said that corporations are people
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:45.340]  and someone pointed out that if that's true he's a serial killer yeah i saw that but i i don't want
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:53.660]  to abolish corporations either but we must abolish the political power of business in this country
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:01.260]  it's taken for granted that business has powerful business has a veto over everything and that means
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:07.740]  it's taken for granted that we've lost our democracy no one should think about that without
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:15.900]  without feeling disgusted and saying this must be changed get that book because he explains how
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:23.980]  it's not an accident that the supreme court gave corporations unlimited power to to pay for
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:35.660]  political ads it's the culmination of a 40 year or 35 year perhaps campaign for giving human rights
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:43.260]  to corporations it is very very dangerous and now those corporations are destroying our sovereignty
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:49.980]  our local control dr stallman thank you so much for spending time with us and again give us your
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:55.500]  website and any other websites you think are important for people to look at for free software
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:04.460]  look at the free software foundation site that is fsf.org and you can join if you wish for my
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:11.500]  other political causes look at stallman.org and if you want to join our fight against digital
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:22.940]  handcuffs drm go to defectivebydesign.org and for the danger of ebooks and how they take away our
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:32.540]  freedom look at stallman.org slash articles slash ebooks dot pdf all right doc thanks for the time
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:39.100]  and but in the final statement is i mean just reiterating you think it's really exciting that
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:45.660]  there's such an awakening to the power grabbing of the copyright uh industry and the fact that
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.460]  hollywood and others just think they control the known universe uh and this has certainly
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:55.180]  gotten their attention what do you expect them to do now how will they'll find another way you see
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:41:03.180]  whether we defeat SOPA or not even if even if we defeat it it'll be clear that we defeated it
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:09.260]  because the measures they wanted to take were going to cause tremendous damage to everything
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:15.900]  around them but if they propose something else that'll give them more power but won't hurt
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:23.820]  other companies they might still get away with it so what that means is we still have a long way to
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:31.260]  go in building up our opposition to the point where we can start to undo some of the injustices
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:39.260]  they have already put into copyright law so it was just so ham-fisted uh and and and so brazen
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:44.380]  bull in a china cabinet they were unable to get it but they will come back and it does show how
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:51.020]  i mean remember five years ago when mccain said let's pass a bill where no judge no jury no proof
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:57.340]  no proof we just kill your computer uh if if we think you did something copyright i mean this is
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:03.260]  overthrowing our entire magna carta our entire constitution i mean it's tyrannical on its face
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:09.420]  doc absolutely but that's what big business is like big business just wants power and has no
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:16.380]  respect for anything wow well i look forward to speaking to you again thank you so much
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:21.740]  doctor happy hacking and thanks for giving me the chance yeah thanks for being with us what
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:26.700]  an interesting fellow wow uh that was a very powerful interview went a little bit longer
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:31.100]  than i intended it to get a lot to cover but uh it's important now i'm not going to have time to
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:38.140]  air all of this uh it's 15 minutes long it it's up at infowars.com but i want to play it here on
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:43.660]  the radio viral video resistance is victory the tide is turning and i go through a lot of the
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:51.100]  solutions but one that i don't cover here is the biggest solution and and the biggest victory
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:59.980]  and that is that the awakening is viral right now people are really starting to understand with the
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:04.220]  passage of the nda and the rest of it look at the support of ron paul look at the so-called
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:08.860]  mainstream media losing almost all its viewers and listeners they're in implosion they're in free
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:13.500]  fall that's what this soap of things about that's a big part of it that's why the mainstream corporate
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:20.780]  prostitutes endorsed it uh the system is scared they built this whole grid to surveil us it's
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:26.700]  backfired on uh and i'm not saying we're even winning the fight we're in the fight i agree with
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:31.820]  dr stallman it was on he said this is the you know we're really starting to see humanity get in the
[01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:39.180]  fight and you're really starting to see humanity wake up that all is not well in the state of
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:46.700]  denmark uh as uh shakespeare would say and so it's very very exciting so all of you need to realize
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:52.460]  the internet is still somewhat free we still have the power of free speech until the big false flag
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:58.220]  or the war with iran and all the other garbage coming down the pike if we speak out now while
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:04.780]  the sun shines the globalists may back off i know they may slow down things won't go as well for
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:10.620]  them so now is the time like never before while we've still got the internet while we've still
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:15.340]  well while so many people are listening while so many people understand what's happening to
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:20.700]  gain the initiative which we're starting to get and turn this around so here is uh our report
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:25.740]  erin dykes have put this together amazing job erin and the article and video is at info wars
[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:30.380]  dot com please get it and get it out to everyone you know it's titled resistance is victory the
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:35.740]  tide is turning we'll play part of it go to break come back and play the rest and then uh wayne
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:40.460]  paul brother of ron paul's coming up talking about the incredible election fraud now coming out
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.340]  confirmed we told you so they're throwing out the election results in iowa and they're not saying
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:51.260]  what that means so now i guess they'll just admit fraud in states and then give it to santorum or
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:56.220]  romney well there's fraud but we say it's them we had a good old boy meeting and you know what
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:02.860]  carl rove saying just you know had a gentleman's agreement let's go ahead and go to this video
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:07.820]  it's up to you if this gets out to everybody here it is if you are receiving this transmission
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:15.020]  you are the resistance i've said it before and i'll say it again resistance is victory that
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:23.100]  simple initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action is the most important
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:30.460]  decision you can make because from that flows all other major actions in the fight for freedom and
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:36.220]  human dignity worldwide but you first got to get angry you've got to get focused and you've got to
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:44.780]  get engaged the world is at a crossroads we have a decision to make no one can deny anymore that
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:50.620]  tyranny is growing and casting its long dark shadow across not just the united states but
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:46:00.060]  worldwide but in the midst of all of this and as we move deeper into 2012 it is important to realize
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:08.620]  the incredible successes complete and partial that we've had against tyranny these are just a few in
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:14.220]  the last year in fact after you're done watching this video i would ask you to post comments with
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:20.700]  points that you believe have been victories so we can make a part two video but here are just
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:30.860]  some of them the sopa bill or stopping online piracy act which is really just a trojan horse
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:37.260]  as the inventors of the internet many others went public and documented to shut down free speech
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:43.100]  and to allow giant corporate monoliths to basically carve up the internet and take it
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:48.220]  over for their own uses and shut down their competition but you saw the go daddy protest
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:53.740]  that caused hundreds of thousands of their customers to leave them many of the big internet
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:59.980]  companies and smaller ones as well led by reddit and others saying that they were going to basically
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:08.860]  black out their websites to protest the fact that this sopa bill is a free speech killing system
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:13.980]  and now because of the actions that you and others took the system who just a few weeks ago
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:19.900]  was very arrogant and said resistance is futile we're going to pass this we've got hundreds more
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.780]  votes than we need in the house suddenly it's crumbled and they're saying okay we're shelving
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:30.220]  it for now and they hope that later you'll go back to sleep that they can repackage their lies
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:37.900]  and bring it back forward but the point here is when we take action and when the people stand
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:45.420]  up for basic fundamental rights the system and the oligarchs that control it are brought to
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:52.300]  their knees so a big victory in early 2012 against something the system told us was a
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:57.900]  foregone conclusion they don't just stop there trying to craft our reality they've told us for
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:03.500]  a year that ron paul cannot win that no one would vote for him that he wasn't even a real
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:09.500]  candidate that there was no way he could ever come in third fourth fifth place much less second in
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:17.820]  new hampshire and a statistical dead heat in iowa but despite the entire dinosaur whore media the
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:23.500]  zombie control media telling you he can't win and excluding him from debates and giving him 89
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:28.780]  seconds in other debates and all the demonization and all the dirty tricks and everything they've
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:36.380]  got being thrown at ron paul he is growing in the polls nationwide and is a very strong second
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:43.260]  place even if he loses even if they engage in election fraud we all win because real issues are
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:48.700]  being injected and a movement for liberty worldwide is growing ron paul and all of us that
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:53.340]  support him aren't just an example for freedom here in the u.s there are movements sprouting
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:59.980]  up all over the world we are offering the alternative to the crony capitalist anti-free
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:05.420]  market monopoly men that run our government and other major governments who are trying to shut
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:11.500]  down the true free market and destroy our private property ron paul and his resistance and our
[01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:17.740]  support of him is victory let me move to some of the other big victories we've had in the last few
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:24.380]  months all over the united states from california to florida but also in canada and europe and the
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:31.740]  united kingdom major cities and towns are removing the toxic waste sodium fluoride and other
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:39.900]  byproducts from their water supplies one county in florida has a million residents in it and the
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:47.500]  city council overwhelmingly after seeing the scientific evidence moved to remove the toxic
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:56.700]  toxic brain altering chemical from the water supply huge victory for more than 60 years
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:03.260]  globalist corporations in a bid to reduce fertility shows bisphenol a is a key ingredient
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:08.780]  in most plastics to reduce fertility there were literally thousands of other formulae that didn't
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:18.300]  have the estrogen mimicker in it but now 60 years later all over the world businesses corporations
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:26.060]  restaurants are advertising that they have bisphenol free products whether it's baggies for
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:34.300]  food or furniture or clothing this is another example of a human awakening taking place and in
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:41.260]  just a matter of a few years public protest and voting with your dollars has overturned one of
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:48.860]  the main globalist tools of chemical control medical tyranny that was used in nazi germany
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:53.980]  soviet all right we're going to come right back and you know what i'm going to do i'm going to

[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:27.100]  different diseases here because suddenly this stuff's spreading everywhere and it wasn't here

[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:09.820]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:14.860]  number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:20.460]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:25.580]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:30.860]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:35.500]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:40.860]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:32.540]  okay we got wayne paul brother of congressman ron paul presidential
[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:37.900]  front runner ron paul in first or second place depending on what poll you look at on with us
[02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:44.380]  just because i wanted to get his take he's a long time activist cpa you know going after the irs
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:51.180]  exposing the fellow reserve uh you know just a chip off the family paul block there but when i
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:57.100]  saw this this morning and it's got no no media attention that is dinosaur media i mean they're
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:01.820]  covering it but they're not pointing out the obvious now here's a headline out of news 14
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:07.660]  final iowa tally gives santorum we'll show folks a document cam shot of that they're listening
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:15.180]  on the radio they can just google it and pull it up but final iowa tally gives santorum edge
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:24.380]  over romney no winner declared and uh it goes over uh the fact that well
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:30.620]  a whole bunch of the key precincts in aims iowa where he was running 50 plus percent in the polls
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:36.620]  ron paul those just disappeared and then we also have the clip we've played four or five times we
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:42.860]  could probably cue it up and play it again for wayne uh where uh we have on fox news carl rove
[02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:49.420]  known for his uh election manipulation saying well a bunch of the ballots didn't show up so
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:55.020]  they all just got behind the scenes together as uh as gentlemen and decided that santorum was in
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:10:01.500]  second and that uh mit romney was in first and then ron paul was in a close third and ron paul
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:07.180]  doesn't want to act like a sore loser he says hey we're doing pretty good they did second in in in um
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:12.460]  new hampshire but the point is that night we'd already been told by people that some of the
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:16.940]  precincts were going to count it in secret and why were there trucks driving around that disappeared
[02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:23.420]  you call it in and and and so now it's admitted that a bunch of these disappeared and stuff went
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:30.460]  on and so the news is saying santorum first place mit romney second and in and in literally more
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:36.060]  than 20 articles we pulled up not one word about ron paul you would think he was a four-letter
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:43.980]  word or something a cuss word i mean it's just no ron paul no discussion of him uh anywhere here is
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:54.940]  the demoins register it's got rick santorum total of 29 839 and it says final total 29 805 for mit
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:11:03.020]  romney so you see that he's got 30 34 votes more there santorum does and no discussion of how what
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:08.700]  happened with ron paul and they go on and admit in these articles well they may not even count it now
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:14.540]  but here's the numbers final iowa tally gives santorum edge over romney no winner declared
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:20.780]  who does that do they have another meeting uh with uh carl rove behind the scenes i guess with
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:26.940]  with some people that are are gentlemanly and have a gentleman's agreement so there's no discussion
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:32.780]  of why why did all these precincts not report why was there fraud that got ignored day one
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:38.060]  and where is ron paul i mean all of this happening just fits into ron paul getting
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:42.380]  kicked out of debates or 89 seconds in the debates or getting the least amount of coverage
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:49.340]  or when he does it's negative and they say he can't win uh and shoving mit romney santorum and
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:56.140]  ginrich all globalist flip-floppers on us i wanted to get uh wayne paul's take on this because this
[02:11:56.140 --> 02:12:01.340]  really shows uh how crazy things have gotten you know we were concerned the day before wayne as you
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:06.460]  know and some folks at the campaign were like oh no there's no problem but uh i mean what do you
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:12.620]  do when this type stuff's going on wayne well i think it's frustrating for all the supporters
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:22.860]  for ron paul but even more so it's got to be frustrating for the people of iowa
[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:33.500]  who truly want honest results from vote to have a view that manipulate the straw poll vote
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:41.820]  for their own gain how to make the people in iowa very very upset and very very concerned
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:49.980]  about who's telling what to whom and they should be upset they should be mad and they should want
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:56.300]  to kick these kind of people out and get somebody in arizona again wayne paul joining us from texas
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:04.060]  wayne though uh you cannot debate that a bunch of ballots disappeared people call in the the votes
[02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:09.020]  they'd get changed obviously something went on here the republican leadership counted it in
[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:14.380]  secret i guess so they could get away with this and now they admit it's a fraud but they say
[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:20.780]  still we're going with these guys i mean this is bizarre and and again the media is not even
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:25.740]  pointing out how bizarre it is why do you i mean there's not only fraud here wayne obviously but
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:32.460]  what do you think of them not even mentioning your brother uh as if he even exists well the major
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:40.540]  media has attempted to do that since the last go round four years ago i think the other thing
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:51.020]  that frustrates me about iowa is that before the iowa straw poll vote was taken i heard
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:14:05.100]  i heard on a youtube where one of the state republican people stated and i heard a voice
[02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:14.140]  can't tell you who it was but stated that they always consider changing votes to the final before
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:22.460]  the final vote because that's just the way they operate uh yeah they had a media analyst on fox
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:28.140]  and on the news but she she works with fox say the day two days before state officials aren't
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:34.620]  gonna let ron paul win they're gonna handle it right and and then uh we played that clip here
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:39.580]  and then i understand the campaign doesn't want to look like sore losers but when there's fraud
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:44.460]  going on out in the open i mean i'm glad that your brother is now suing the people that made
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:49.500]  this video who claim they work for huntsman to make your brother look like he doesn't like asians
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:56.460]  i mean they're the look what they did to uh to to your nephew rand claiming he worships
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:07.340]  buddha and kidnaps women and isn't a doctor yep it's just unfortunately i like it appears to be a
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:19.740]  sign of our time that those that have the ability to manipulate results for certain people's benefit
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:28.940]  it's that the true honest conservative libertarian individual in america is not
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:40.620]  not saying what's really happening you know even after the last debate they showed on cnn or fox
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:49.580]  or one of them the fact the fact that on twitter ron had positive results on all four or five
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:59.900]  that were spoken to but they seemed to brush that off that that was no big deal but normally they
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:06.540]  say twitter is the main indicator of just sheer numbers he was he was beating them all he's the
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:14.060]  main front runner and and and notice that these ballots disappeared in key young people in college
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:20.860]  areas that were polling more than 50 percent for ron paul wayne it makes you wonder doesn't it yeah
[02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:31.900]  but but so i mean obviously look if they'll steal his time and lie about him and ignore him
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:36.220]  and and tell us that they're doing this because they're deciding for us of course they'll engage
[02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:41.100]  in election fraud too do people think they're just going to stop at lying about him and doing
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:45.500]  all this in the media no they're going to go all the way and they did i mean we've got fraud here
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:49.900]  but no investigation is going to happen just like when i found found fraud in travis county
[02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:54.940]  i took it to the state board live on tv and they said there is fraud but we're going to certify
[02:16:54.940 --> 02:17:03.340]  the travis county election anyways yep yep well and i really don't know the answer except
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:12.540]  except that each person in each precinct wherever they're at whatever state they're in
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:21.100]  if they're in south carolina right now what are they going to do and how are they going to ensure
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:28.700]  that there's honesty that my vote will be counted and be counted honestly
[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:37.340]  uh there has to be a mechanism to be able to do this and there are several groups that's trying to
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:46.140]  create an online instantaneous reporting from each precinct anywhere in any state that's voting
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:54.380]  so that it can be transferred put up on a screen and everybody that has a computer can see what
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:58.780]  the votes are do they come in well it is because of stuff like that and people on the ground that
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:04.620]  we knew about the fraud day one people are like oh be quiet day after it's admitted it happened
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:08.780]  and two weeks later they're just saying accept the fraud i want to come back in one more segment
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:12.860]  with wayne paul ron paul's brother political activist patriot in his own right but if you
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:19.260]  could say one thing to your brother ron paul uh right now just a shout out to him uh what
[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:25.580]  would that be a and b if you've talked to your brother lately you know uh how's he doing well

[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:44.620]  reiterate zero taxes are fantastic and people all they have to do is look at history from 1835 to

[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:29.740]  all right it is our final segment with uh wayne paul is very busy uh cpa in his own right and
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:35.980]  political activist exposing the uh unconstitutional irs joining us the middle of his workday uh here
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:39.740]  we only got a few minutes left but but talking to him to finish that question he says he's talked
[02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:44.860]  to ron last weekend he's doing great super fired up but you can see that on the campaign trail
[02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:52.460]  your brother really looks more happy and fired up than i've ever seen him it's got to be satisfying
[02:24:52.460 --> 02:24:57.420]  uh to you know to see how much uh he's having an effect waking people up wayne
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:03.340]  that's absolutely correct i think the other thing that has uh
[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:11.020]  uh made him comfortable and more restful the fact that he's been able to
[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:19.420]  uh travel from place to place differently than he did four years ago having to use commercial
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:26.060]  airlines he doesn't do that this time therefore he's able to get more downtime and restful time
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:30.860]  which is what he really needs oh the airport will beat the daylights out of you and when he
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:36.060]  started flying private the media made fun of it when all the other candidates do i mean we need
[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:41.500]  him to be getting places faster and getting more rest i mean we need to it's ridiculous that
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:47.100]  liberty's champion of course should be flying around with all his staff and and i saw the news
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:52.940]  had to admit it costs less to fly the 10 or 15 people on a private jet than it does even flying
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:26:00.060]  commercial most times that that is correct besides the amount of time saving you know there's an
[02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:09.020]  airport 15 minutes from my brother's house so he can still fly back home at midnight and be in bed
[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:15.260]  before 12 30 and the tsa doesn't get to grope him as well i know he said that this happens to him
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:19.820]  when he flies commercial oh yeah i want to play you a short clip of carl rove it's unedited except
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:24.940]  for a kenducky derby clip at the end making a joke about santorum popping into the lead from
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:30.540]  nowhere but here's carl rove on fox news listen to this way romney is going to win the iowa
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:36.380]  caucuses by 14 votes how solid is your evidence uh you're you're from a pretty good reliable source
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:41.660]  they made the correction in story county which moved it from an 18-point margin for santorum
[02:26:41.660 --> 02:26:46.540]  to a four point a four vote margin for santorum clinton counter you have the one outstanding
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:53.740]  precinct in the state and that it will show an 18 uh vote victory in that precinct for for
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:59.820]  mitt romney which will give him a statewide victory of 14 votes over and from out of nowhere
[02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:03.180]  it's wick santorum i don't understand you're saying that they basically have come to an
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:08.700]  agreement as to what the vote is going to be in the official the person who's got the official
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:14.460]  piece of paper is missing but the romney and santorum people who are monitoring it agree on
[02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:19.180]  what the number is they apparently rounded up the representatives of the camps who have agreed yes
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:24.140]  we were there we know exactly what the vote total was and we both agreed to uh agree to what it was
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:30.860]  so uh carl rove magically knew this was pretty early in the evening that night what the totals
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:36.540]  were and now two weeks later it's an admitted fraud just as our watchers said ron paul clearly
[02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:41.900]  in every case was getting more votes and now he's not even mentioned in this wayne i mean i go back
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:51.660]  to this this is a big story well it is absolutely a big story but again i have to emphasize the fact
[02:27:52.620 --> 02:28:02.060]  that the people of iowa are being shortchanged by those who are manipulating numbers and votes for
[02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:11.900]  somebody's eventual gain and the people in iowa ought to be livid on just hearing this stuff they
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:17.340]  they ought to take the republican party of the state of iowa and kick them all around to start
[02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:21.820]  over again yeah very frustrating exactly they're not even telling us what's going to go on the
[02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:27.100]  delegates they say the election the quote is no winner declared but they're going to say the
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:34.460]  winner santorum very bizarre no discussion of where the votes win no discussion of redoing it
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:38.700]  and and i understand why the campaign's not making a bigger deal out of this because it can be spun
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:46.380]  they're sore losers or it might or sorry go ahead wayne no and i think the important thing
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:53.340]  is the positive approach um saying okay that's fine let's head on to new hampshire and now
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:29:00.300]  south carolina and then wherever border whatever is next we'll take them one state at a time
[02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:07.980]  and and we'll get the people to support us and eventually they're going to be forced to
[02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:15.900]  reckon with us one way or the other and i think we'll find that out in the next three to six months
[02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:22.220]  they're going to have to deal with the young people that support my brother and they've got
[02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:27.980]  to decide whether they want them in the republican party or they do not want to grow the republican
[02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:34.140]  party that's right and alex i live in a very small county tell you what stay there let's go to break
[02:29:34.140 --> 02:29:37.820]  and just do a few more minutes on the other side wayne you've got more to say i've been throwing
[02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:42.300]  in so many points i want to hear what you have to say on the other side and we'll get into all the
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:47.580]  other news on internet censorship there's something a lot bigger than sopa out there i'll tell you

[02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:25.500]  the only conservative constitutionalist out there congressman ron paul and again we don't want there
[02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:31.340]  to be fraud but i mean clearly ron paul was the winner in iowa clearly they've been attacking him
[02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:36.940]  lying about him and so understand folks we're winning just by ron paul running we're winning
[02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:41.500]  uh look at where he's come from four years ago look at what ran's doing in the senate
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:45.580]  trying to block and exposing tyrannical legislation they've got all these campaigns
[02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:52.300]  for liberty people who are true constitutionalists now running uh it's going to get exponentially
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:58.780]  more powerful as we build and ron paul could win i mean he's gone from nowhere with the media
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:05.580]  ignoring him to number two probably number one and the records of the other guys are so pitiful
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:10.460]  if we get behind him it's on and folks all over the country i talked to talk show hosts you name
[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:15.500]  it liberals conservatives they all love ron paul every caller i hear the local radio says i want
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:22.940]  ron paul and the host says too bad you can't have him i mean to hear the corporate dinosaur media
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:28.780]  with their parroting that ron paul can't win telling their own audience that they're idiots
[02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:35.820]  it's you're really seeing uh this paradox uh here wayne paul you were i think getting to that point
[02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:40.780]  you were talking about you live in a small town i live in a a small county in texas
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:53.580]  uh and even in our county four years ago there was such contempt that because i worked in the
[02:34:53.580 --> 02:35:01.820]  precinct and went to the county convention i was in effect ostracized because of my name
[02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:10.860]  and it was pretty frustrating to to see that happen uh and then to hear our governor at that
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:19.180]  time at the state convention saying since we don't have anybody running for president even do what
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:27.900]  you want with your votes and uh from texas and they didn't even grant him favorite son's son
[02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:36.780]  status perry would even grant that he had four years ago well look at perry he's coming back
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:41.260]  with his tail between his legs exposed for working for al gore and all the rest of it
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:46.380]  i mean if one thing we're learning here the republican leadership is basically a bunch of
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:54.380]  globalist socialist corporatist democrats masquerading as conservatives well it sure
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:36:02.940]  looks like that and i think the greater issue is what do the republic what does the republican
[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:12.540]  party nationwide statewide and county-wide what do they want to do to grow their party
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:19.580]  it's evident they're not anxious to do it in everything they do they're so we don't care
[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:26.060]  and that's very unfortunate well in closing uh ron paul your brother has pretty much said no i'm
[02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:32.460]  probably not going to run third party but stop trying to make me say what i'll do you obsess
[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:39.740]  on this and and i understand that running third party uh you know it it's it it it would probably
[02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:44.700]  be hard to get elected but he would be able to continue to inject real ideas which is winning
[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:52.220]  resistance his victory uh and i understand that then they could demonize the congressman of if uh
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:57.740]  if uh obama got re-elected because of it you know claiming like he did what ross perot did
[02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:02.780]  uh so it is a complex issue but uh what's your view on your brother running third party well
[02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:12.380]  it's not gonna happen uh i think the problem uh is that the republican party is trying to spread
[02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:23.500]  they spread or develop that rumor because they do not want to turn around and defeat our current
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:31.100]  president because ron's the only one that can do it and they can't handle it so they're gonna try
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:37.820]  everything in their power to blame it on somebody else except the national republican party that's
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:44.300]  right they gotta make up their mind because by the time we get to the convention there's gonna
[02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:49.820]  be a good republican party's face because they don't want the young people they don't want the
[02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:56.940]  libertarian and they don't want the disenfranchised democrats in their party and they're gonna try to
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:38:03.180]  blame it on whomever they can and it ain't gonna happen well i agree with you and i've told people
[02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:08.300]  that um i don't think your brother's gonna run for third party uh he just doesn't like being you know
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:13.340]  having an option close to him and i in the end and he has wisdom you obviously have wisdom people are
[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:17.980]  hearing it right now that's probably a good move i just wish there was somebody prominent third
[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:22.860]  party just so they could be in the debates but who knows your brother probably run third party
[02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:26.780]  and probably have 30 of the vote out of the game they probably wouldn't have him in the debate
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:33.740]  yeah i mean you know they're that big of cheats well it's not going to happen the national
[02:38:33.740 --> 02:38:39.500]  republican party is going to have to make up their mind that they're going to have to deal with it
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:44.140]  or they're the one that's going to have egg on their face well by the way as you know you're
[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:47.900]  right they've got a whole bunch of polls that have been coming out for six months and they're
[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:55.180]  ron paul has for those that don't know has the highest numbers against obama and i mean he he
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:39:01.820]  would clean the floor with obama wouldn't he uh i don't have any doubt in my mind because of his
[02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:11.260]  consistency in his stances in his position in cutting back government you know and in obtaining
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:18.940]  a greater national defense by bringing our troops home all of these things resonate with the majority
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:24.060]  of the people in the united states and the one trillion dollar first year budget cut getting rid
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:28.620]  of the income tax that we built the country without uh ending the torture of the secret
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:34.700]  arrest in closing again your brother the only one of the only sane people in congress he's gotten a
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:40.540]  few people in under him but they're not prominent yet ron paul introduced his legislation to strike
[02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:49.500]  ndaa's police state provisions boom no corporate media coverage of that speech yesterday they just
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:54.540]  said he was up there to do a futile vote against debt increase which is not futile doing the right
[02:39:54.540 --> 02:40:05.180]  thing uh and uh it continues uh with uh rand saying he's gonna filibuster or block the sopa
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:10.620]  bill that goes after the free speech uh what's your take on the ndaa uh and the fact that the
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:16.460]  trader media won't cover that ron paul's trying to repeal it well i i can refer you to daily
[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:23.100]  powell his total speech is on daily powell this morning yes in fact we've got it in our article
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.620]  that nemo did as well we probably should have actually played that speech but we've run out
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:31.100]  of time we'll probably play it on the nightly news this evening uh boy i'll tell you uh have
[02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:36.860]  you found wayne that that's a wake-up call that the ndaa uh actually passed the secret arrest of
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:48.380]  citizens well again it points to the people in power not caring about the people they're not
[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:56.620]  representing the citizens of the united states and the citizens of the united states are going
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:41:03.980]  to change that this year yes and despite the corporate trader media i tell you wayne we've
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:07.340]  been trying to come up with a name for the mainstream media because they're not the mainstream
[02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:13.100]  anymore the alternative is now the new media is bigger uh i've got a video out today showing major
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:17.900]  studies showing that uh and i've known this for a couple years what would you call the
[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:31.740]  prestitude trader media globalist media mud stream media mud stream uh sure line media there you go
[02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:45.100]  the listeners we're all trying to comb the world for the best name mud stream media
[02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:54.140]  oh boy uh all right yeah i'm sorry go ahead you're gonna say something no no no that's all
[02:41:54.140 --> 02:42:02.540]  right now go ahead wayne in closing well i just want to say uh it's people like you and people
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:10.300]  that want honest straightforward answers that are going to make the difference in this country in
[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:18.220]  the next six months and they will be their quiet revolution in terms of making sure that we get
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:25.580]  honesty in government we get limited government we get stronger military government and that's
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:31.180]  going to take place regardless of what the mud stream media puts out there and the mud
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:37.580]  flying media that's even better there you go all right well great job wayne god bless you and say

[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:16.300]  to try to censor us and shut us down but there's an article that paul watson did this morning
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:21.420]  because it hit me last night everything that google says they're fighting and soba they're
[02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:26.220]  already doing they're already taking websites down under government request they're already
[02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:31.500]  banning they've already delisted us from most of their search engines kicking us off the news
[02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:37.580]  feature a few years ago when obama started running uh you know we've gone and i mean they even
[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:42.700]  deleted videos where we were bullhorning uh schmidt the you know the head of google at
[02:46:42.700 --> 02:46:48.460]  bilderberg i mean they're censoring us and i'm sick of it you understand they're already doing
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:52.300]  it they just don't want the knuckle dragon government to have the control because they've
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:56.380]  already got it this article is important and folks they are trying to censor us i hope you
[02:46:56.380 --> 02:47:01.660]  get it out to everybody i hope you realize info wars.com prison planet.com the nightly news the
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:06.060]  radio show what we do if the globalists have their way you're not going to be hearing this
[02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:12.380]  okay this is real the white house regulations are says they want to shut us down i'm on the
[02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:17.740]  white house enemies list i'm under surveillance i'm doing this out in front of everybody

[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:32.620]  you because if they kill me it highlights everything i've said it puts an exclamation point
[02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:37.260]  on me but behind everything i've said but let me tell you they can start shutting us down they will
[02:47:37.260 --> 02:47:42.780]  come after me they'll start shutting me down in the years to come and throwing dirt and pr
[02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:49.180]  campaigns ahead of it and they'll set me up kill me whatever but they still can't stop us it's just
[02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:53.900]  individually i'd like that not to happen so i hope you'll continue to spread the word your email list
[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:59.900]  facebook twitter youtube everywhere info wars.com there's a reason they've got armies of trolls after
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:05.740]  us there's a reason the system is always demonizing because i'm a symbol as well of just an average
[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:09.740]  person saying i'm not going to take it anymore and if they can tear down ron paul or tear down
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:15.580]  ron paul or tear down alex jones they can tear down you like it or not ron paul alex jones and
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:21.340]  a few others we are what is representative of the liberty movement i never even tried to become this
[02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:26.940]  prominent i just am like a like a pit bull and i keep coming so i've had incredible success thanks
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:34.140]  to your support but we are we belong to you now you understand that i am you you are me if they
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:40.700]  are able to do this it's a bad day if they take me out who will take my place that's another question
[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:46.940]  this article is important i'm going to try to get to it google is already using sopa-like
[02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:52.220]  censorship and it's totally proven here web giant blacklist websites follows government orders
[02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:58.300]  to remove material despite google's much heralded support for the anti-sopa movement the web giant
[02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:03.820]  is already enforcing sopa-like policies of its own blacklisting legitimate websites from its news
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:09.580]  aggregator following government orders to remove material from its search results and youtube we've
[02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:14.300]  also confirmed that they block our view counters going up but then with establishment stuff they
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:19.580]  don't block the view counters we've confirmed that before i was like no it's a normal caching issue
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:27.980]  yeah they're covering censorship with that as major internet giants joined forces yesterday
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:32.300]  to protest legislation that would hand the u.s government power to arbitrarily seize websites
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:38.140]  with no legal process under the pretext of copyright infringement google slapped a black

[02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:52.620]  over five million signees however google's main issue with sopa is seemingly not related to the
[02:49:52.620 --> 02:50:00.060]  concerns about chinese-style web censorship becoming commonplace but rather which entity
[02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:05.260]  gets to wield those powers large transnational corporations or governments that are now

[02:54:18.140 --> 02:54:24.780]  and uh you know it is a badge of honor that they've delisted us but again because routinely
[02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:30.860]  our articles it whatever was the newest and the most popular it would kind of algorithm those two
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:34.860]  together and that would put you at the top and i guess they didn't like when there was a london
[02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:39.740]  bombing that our articles were the top for a week being read by millions i guess they didn't like
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:45.340]  that we were able to win you know you put us on the field and with our analysis and understanding
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:52.700]  we were challenging them and so bye-bye info wars.com bye-bye prison planet.com bye-bye
[02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:56.780]  and google is doing and people say well they're a private corporation no they've created basically
[02:54:56.780 --> 02:55:00.620]  a monopoly and they operate like it's free and fair that's why they're getting in antitrust
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:07.180]  trouble continuing info awards.com alone is internationally recognized but it's not listed

[02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:46.620]  publications have said the same thing info wars.com is clearly a legitimate and important news
[02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:51.820]  website that features original content which routinely makes an impact and occasionally goes
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:58.620]  viral goes viral every day that's watson being understated and yet google delisted the websites
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:03.820]  from its news aggregator on a whim with no explanation provided since google and its owner
[02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:09.020]  eric schmidt are prominent financial contributors to the obama campaign we can only assume we were
[02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:13.740]  blacklisted for political reasons they were shutting down videos of schmidt at bilderberg
[02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:19.180]  and he's like i don't want me i don't want you know that on there whether you concur with our
[02:56:19.180 --> 02:56:24.460]  political stance or are radically against it what can't be argued is that we are legitimate news
[02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:29.820]  outfit but google has arbitrarily banned us from appearing on their news search results but it
[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:36.060]  doesn't stop there there is a clear example of how google is already enforcing sopa-like rules
[02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:39.820]  on its of its own choosing how the feds just order things delisted outside of court
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:45.500]  without the need for any law to be passed or by any legislative body and it goes on in addition
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:51.500]  while concerns rage about the state obtaining the power to shut down websites and remove web content
[02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:56.540]  with no recourse google is already following we have links to that orders from the federal
[02:56:56.540 --> 02:57:03.420]  government in the majority of cases removing videos from youtube platform including takedowns
[02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:08.540]  on the grounds that quote videos contain government criticism google it admits that
[02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:12.300]  it admits that government criticism is taken down i mean right there that's it
[02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:16.780]  where's all the cause celebs now i mean this is already going on
[02:57:17.820 --> 02:57:21.100]  and microsoft the rest of them help the communist chinese censor their people
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:27.100]  google owned youtube has complied with thousands of requests worldwide to remove political protest
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:32.060]  videos that are clearly not in violation of any copyright or national security interest
[02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:37.340]  and do not constitute defamation the number of takedown orders received from google from
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:41.340]  authorities base the united states rose dramatically over the past year with demands
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:47.660]  to remove information increasing by 70 percent yeah they took down our obama deception when one
[02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:51.580]  video had like nine million views i threatened to sue them it suddenly went right back up i said we
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:57.660]  know you took it down it isn't a hack i'm gonna sue you you got 24 hours boom right back up because
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:01.500]  i was i guess they must tap my phone the government or something because i was calling the lawyers
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:07.660]  i mean they knew and it went right back up and i'm looking at suing you right now i'm gonna be
[02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:13.020]  honest because because you're you're you're you're you're sitting on us you're blocking us

[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:23.100]  want to keep everybody in the dark just like you want to block out ron paul they go through just
[02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:27.420]  page after page of example of their wicked censorship all bibliographed that's why they
[02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:31.980]  hate us because our articles are all documented all right i mean compared to the corporate
