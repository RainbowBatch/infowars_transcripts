[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:39.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.680 --> 00:47.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday Worldwide
[00:48.320 --> 00:57.040]  Edition. And we are going to be here for the next three hours. John B. Wells, syndicated radio host
[00:57.040 --> 01:02.080]  on Coast to Coast AM and also top voiceover talent, always informative political mind.
[01:02.080 --> 01:04.800]  We'll be joining us to talk about all the different scandals and to get his take on it
[01:04.800 --> 01:12.160]  and take your phone calls. We're going to have open phones on this Friday, separate to that as
[01:12.160 --> 01:21.520]  well. And we are going to be going over all of the top stories that are up on infowars.com
[01:22.320 --> 01:30.880]  and prisonplanet.com. And this one is a doozy, and it's hiding in plain view like it's no big
[01:30.880 --> 01:39.920]  deal. Military says no presidential authorization needed to quell civil disturbances.
[01:43.280 --> 01:50.400]  Now, did you hear that? Now, they made movies like Dr. Strangelove just about the power to nuke
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.120]  being taken away from Congress, which is a violation of the war powers, and transferred
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.200]  into the, quote, President, and then into a decapitation program where the President and the
[02:01.200 --> 02:08.880]  top cabinet were wiped out. Only under that emergency, under nuclear attack, would the
[02:08.880 --> 02:14.560]  launch codes be given to generals, and then General Jack T. Ripper launches a B-52 strike
[02:14.560 --> 02:20.160]  on Russia. And of course, there was really a plan R under another name. That was really going on in
[02:20.160 --> 02:27.680]  1962, 63. That's why Stanley Kubrick made the film in 64, a real classic.
[02:31.040 --> 02:38.800]  With group Captain Mandrake and George C. Scott, all of it truly amazing. Well, now they're saying,
[02:38.800 --> 02:46.720]  hey, we don't need the President for massive civil unrest if it breaks out and America authorizes.
[02:46.720 --> 02:50.880]  Well, what does that mean? And then who's authorizing that? And this is just like we have
[02:50.880 --> 02:59.520]  NATO. This is just like we have NATO, via the Joint Chiefs saying, we get authorization for
[02:59.520 --> 03:03.760]  Libya, Syria, you name it, from NATO. That's where the President gets his authorization.
[03:03.760 --> 03:07.840]  He doesn't need it from Congress, because Congress is the one that levies war, levies taxes,
[03:07.840 --> 03:11.600]  power the purse, because it's the most diversified group of hundreds of people.
[03:11.600 --> 03:15.360]  This is our Constitution. And then the President, once a war bill is given,
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.960]  or authorization for military force, is given and directed, he then executes,
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.360]  why he's called a executive. It's like the quarterback, the coaching staff gives him the
[03:27.360 --> 03:33.600]  order. And it's gotta be constitutional, it's gotta be in the rules. The referees are kinda like
[03:33.600 --> 03:40.320]  the courts, okay? So the Congress calls the plays, the quarterback executes.
[03:40.320 --> 03:43.440]  Well, now the quarterback goes, you know what, there's another team.
[03:43.440 --> 03:48.720]  I'm not gonna tell you even who they are. It's just a NATO board. They tell me what plays to play
[03:48.720 --> 03:54.240]  and what I can do. They're my boss, even though they don't pay your paycheck. And then now the
[03:54.240 --> 04:00.480]  military is the players. They're going, you know what? We don't even need the President anymore.
[04:00.480 --> 04:05.040]  So basically, it's a bunch of rogue, out of control government. And this could allow criminal
[04:05.040 --> 04:09.600]  elements in the national security system to stage nuclear attacks, you name it, in the US,
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.000]  name it in the US, and kill the President. There's a reason they've never allowed,
[04:16.640 --> 04:21.600]  in Rome 2,000 years ago, with Caesar, or here, or in England, anywhere.
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.200]  There's a reason they've never let the military launch attacks on its own.
[04:26.080 --> 04:32.240]  Because it will always, always, look at Latin America, look at Africa, look at Asia,
[04:32.240 --> 04:39.760]  look at Europe's history. They will always launch an attack on the government and take over, with a
[04:39.760 --> 04:46.800]  criminal group. And now with this announcement, they can kill the Congress. They could nuke DC,
[04:46.800 --> 04:53.440]  say, during a State of the Union, kill everybody, have top group of generals like Vichy French with
[04:53.440 --> 04:57.520]  the Nazis, and roll them with a takeover. They tried that with Smedley Butler, but he blew
[04:57.520 --> 05:04.240]  the whistle on them. In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[05:04.240 --> 05:10.960]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[05:10.960 --> 05:15.360]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.400]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are, we all are.
[05:20.400 --> 05:25.200]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[05:25.200 --> 05:30.480]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[07:58.880 --> 08:14.800]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:28.880 --> 08:58.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, the preparation for the fall of America
[08:58.240 --> 09:02.640]  and the Western world is entering its final preparations right now.
[09:03.440 --> 09:10.960]  The public is in a narcissistic catatonic brainwave system very close to sleepwalking,
[09:11.600 --> 09:14.800]  and the New World Order is moving forward with their entire takeover program.
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.920]  There are still large portions of the public that are awake and still conscious,
[09:21.920 --> 09:30.560]  but we are in a crisis of biblical proportions for this species right now and for our entire future.
[09:32.560 --> 09:38.880]  There is news up on Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, the auxiliary site,
[09:39.760 --> 09:47.440]  if you can't get to Infowars.com, that is bone chilling when you tie it into the historical
[09:47.440 --> 09:55.360]  ramifications of it, and the way it's just being put out there like it's no big deal.
[09:57.360 --> 10:05.120]  Military says no presidential authorization needed to quell civil disturbances.
[10:06.160 --> 10:13.520]  DOD instruction, kind of like the DOD instructed Cody Wilson not to put up the plans for a 380
[10:13.520 --> 10:24.560]  caliber single shot plastic handgun. This is the way the new system works. DOD instruction
[10:29.360 --> 10:35.200]  seeks to abolish posse commentatis, grease skids for military coup.
[10:37.040 --> 10:40.640]  And I agree with this article, I worked on this article with Paul Watson this morning.
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.680]  A recent notice now is just an instruction. Not like the IRS gives an instruction, no court,
[10:47.680 --> 10:54.080]  no jury, we're gonna take your bank account. Or major banks just take your house even though it's
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.320]  paid for a decade ago and they never had the deed. Doesn't matter, the courts do what they're told.
[10:58.880 --> 11:03.840]  In that case, they do go to court and take your house. They can take whatever they want
[11:03.840 --> 11:09.040]  cuz they have the men with the guns. And the political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[11:09.040 --> 11:14.560]  And nobody's gonna ask why breast cancer is exploding in the Western world to thousands
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.200]  of percentile points, what it was 50 years ago. We're just gonna say, well, we're gonna start
[11:19.200 --> 11:24.880]  removing women's breasts at puberty. That'll be the new thing and then pretty soon we won't
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.680]  be able to live past five or six without massive medical intervention.
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.440]  And no one will ask, why are we all dying of cancer? Why are we all have autism?
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.800]  Why is everybody getting to sick? Why are we all dying of cancer? Why are we all dying of cancer?
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.120]  Why are we all dying of reticular cancer? Why is everybody getting bone cancer? Gee, it's not the
[11:43.120 --> 11:51.040]  GMO where all the studies say they're doing that. Gee, it's not the hydrofluoroelic acid in the
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.000]  water. No, no, no, it's none of that. Let's just take our young girls in to have their
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.120]  breasts removed. You can't have breasts now. Now enjoy that bisphenol A.
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.280]  And don't put down women, support them having double mastectomies at age 12.
[12:08.960 --> 12:12.000]  If you don't support double mastectomies, you don't like women.
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.680]  If you don't like aborting babies, you don't like women. This is the new fruits of America.
[12:17.680 --> 12:24.240]  Women with their breasts all being cut off preemptively and one in 50 something with
[12:24.240 --> 12:29.280]  autism from one in 25,000 and neurological disorders everywhere.
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.920]  I sit there in restaurants and watch people and about half the restaurant, whether somebody's 12
[12:33.920 --> 12:40.800]  years old or 60, they've got Parkinson's type diseases, twitches, people can't talk.
[12:40.800 --> 12:46.160]  People can't talk to you. People don't understand English. People don't, they don't see anything.
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.000]  They just walk around bumping into walls. People are walking around falling in fountains.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.560]  People walk off cliffs now. The brain waves are lowering, the IQs are lowering.
[12:54.560 --> 13:00.720]  And those of us that see everybody falling out around us, we're the bad ones.
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.160]  And it's gonna get crazier and crazier and crazier. And the Pentagon says they're preparing for
[13:06.160 --> 13:11.360]  absolute civil collapse and disturbance. And they've got the army manuals, how they're gonna
[13:11.360 --> 13:15.280]  put you in the camps, how they're gonna take your kids, how they're gonna process your social
[13:15.280 --> 13:21.040]  security numbers, how they're gonna put the digital photos of you. The work brigades,
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.240]  cuz you're gonna have to work when you're in the camp. The forced labor, they call it
[13:26.240 --> 13:34.240]  reeducation directly out of Stalinist or Maoist China. And then I'm the bad one.
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.760]  I'm the bad one. Because when somebody talks to me, I listen to them. I'm the bad one because
[13:39.760 --> 13:45.360]  I've read the Bill of Rights and Constitution and have studied constitutional law. I'm the bad one.
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.160]  Because I've studied quantum mechanics, I'm the bad one.
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.280]  And it's gonna get crazier and crazier. Folks, you're gonna see collapse of civilization.
[13:58.080 --> 14:04.800]  Sometimes I hear all the fear mongering ads on this radio network. And I think, man, that just
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.360]  sounds crazy. But then I go, well, I guess for the awake people, that's who listens to this show.
[14:09.360 --> 14:13.600]  And I guess I'm getting all this stuff too. Some of it goes over the top like,
[14:13.600 --> 14:16.800]  this video is gonna get taken down, so you better go look at it.
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.280]  But I guess they are starting to pull a lot of the videos, so I guess it's kinda true.
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.720]  FM3 dash, yeah, we'll put that army internment. Good job, guys, getting that. FM3-39.40,
[14:32.720 --> 14:39.360]  Internment and Resettlement Operations, February 2010. And it says, they use the term,
[14:39.360 --> 14:45.520]  the re-education camp. Next they'll use the death camp, and they'll be like, well,
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.160]  what's wrong with the death camp? And we all fetishize the uniform, and ooh,
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.560]  I watch the public when cops walk into place. Everyone gets scared, so they have Stockholm
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.040]  syndrome, whether the cops are good or bad. Everyone gets scared, and the cops sit there
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.920]  looking at everybody, look, everybody's scared of me. And people come over and bow, and ooh,
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.640]  ooh, like chimpanzees. They go up to the head chimpanzee and bow before it,
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.840]  and ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I mean, it's just like, and you're all
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.480]  gonna get what you want. You're gonna get the cancer, the neurological disorders, all of it.
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.120]  You want death, it hit me. We've killed something like 53 million babies now
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.240]  in this country via Roe v Wade, 53 mil.
[15:30.480 --> 15:34.400]  But they're not humans, so now they're saying they're gonna kill babies up to age three.
[15:34.400 --> 15:41.440]  We went out yesterday in 15 minutes and talked to 30 people, 20 of them, a round number.
[15:41.440 --> 15:46.560]  Jacari's gone over the video, married tonight or tomorrow. 20 of them wouldn't talk to us,
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.640]  the 10 that did in 15 minutes, cuz that's the drill, you got 15 minutes to talk to people.
[15:52.800 --> 15:58.800]  Four of the 10 that would talk to us, or 40%, we said, now, we're gonna kill children up to
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.720]  age three if the parents have trouble taking care of them or if the state wants to.
[16:02.720 --> 16:10.080]  Post-birth abortion, and they said, yes, I support that. One woman had her kids with her,
[16:10.080 --> 16:16.800]  with them holding her hands. Okay, we're gonna kill kids. It's for a woman's right to choose.
[16:16.800 --> 16:18.880]  She's like, my right to choose? Well, yeah.
[16:18.880 --> 16:26.640]  You know, I do an evil laugh cuz it makes me sick. I can actually look into that world and
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.600]  the New World Order, and it makes me wanna throw up. And it makes me wanna run to the South
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.320]  Pacific into the most primitive island I can find that's got like one fishing village.
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.960]  It makes me want to get my kids and my wife and all butt out of here so fast. But you know what,
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.200]  there's no running, it's gonna be worldwide. There it is, daughters should have the right
[16:47.200 --> 16:51.200]  to kill unwanted or disabled babies at birth, as they are not a real person, claims Oxford
[16:51.200 --> 16:54.960]  Academic. Well, that's nothing, look at the Journal of Bioethics last year, no one believed
[16:54.960 --> 16:58.800]  us on this for a week. They said kill kids up to age three who are even healthy.
[16:58.800 --> 17:06.720]  And then I was the bad one for pointing that out, was Paul Watson discovered it.
[17:12.320 --> 17:19.920]  Toll free number to join us 800-259-9231, 800-25-99231. You know, this morning I was
[17:19.920 --> 17:26.240]  exercising in a local city park. And they had a bunch of field trips out there and you could
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.960]  hear the sound of laughing children running around and older teenagers jogging. There was
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.360]  some kind of school event with a track team. And they had a school band out there at one area,
[17:35.360 --> 17:39.360]  tuning their tubas and things and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[17:39.360 --> 17:46.080]  It's kind of like happy carnival music as I was jogging. And then I sat there stretching
[17:48.080 --> 17:52.160]  and my iPhone was in the car so I didn't tape it. But it was like beautiful sun coming out,
[17:52.160 --> 17:58.880]  little bit of clouds, springtime, music, instruments being tuned, the sound of kids
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.600]  all around me, that shattering happiness. And see, there's gonna be no announcements
[18:03.600 --> 18:06.400]  of our mass extermination. It's gonna be done incrementally.
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.800]  There's gonna be no discussion of where's all the death coming from. It's all gonna be
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.360]  what's the cure? How do we fix it? Never a discussion of why is it all happening.
[18:15.360 --> 18:21.920]  Never a discussion of the statistics rising. Never a discussion of why do you see a kid's
[18:21.920 --> 18:25.840]  get off a bus and a third of them look like they've had electroshock therapy.
[18:28.720 --> 18:33.280]  And then I see the people and I see the walking wounded. I mean, I'm sitting there and I'm looking,
[18:33.280 --> 18:37.440]  I'm like, my God, a third of these people have neurological disorders,
[18:37.440 --> 18:41.440]  tics, clearly are ill. They're even out here trying to exercise to get past this.
[18:41.440 --> 18:48.720]  We're all being murdered, murdered. And it's all being done to, it's an allegory
[18:48.720 --> 18:58.480]  to symphony music. Like when you go into the euthanasia clinic at the end of Soylent Green.
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.080]  And it's the only place beautiful in the society and it's beautiful Mozart and Beethoven and
[19:04.080 --> 19:11.760]  beautiful pastoral scenes while you're given the aphrodisiac opiate-based kill weapon.
[19:11.760 --> 19:18.960]  And then that's it. It's all the entertainment, the glitz, everyone trying to be a movie star,
[19:18.960 --> 19:23.760]  everyone being an egomaniac, everyone being some weird, crazy narcissist. And all I want to do
[19:23.760 --> 19:28.960]  is run to a mountain keep and never see anybody again but my family. I don't like being around
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.480]  people. I don't like being around all the stupid people. And you know what? I figured it out.
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.560]  The new world order doesn't like being around you either. They're killing you and you love it.
[19:36.560 --> 19:42.400]  You love it. You want to be killed. You like it and you are going to be.
[19:43.840 --> 19:48.560]  Made me sick. That's why Oprah Winfrey is meeting with Rockefeller and all of them to discuss
[19:48.560 --> 19:52.880]  population. They're discussing when do they release the bio weapons. They're discussing
[19:52.880 --> 19:56.560]  will they survive when they go underground. They're discussing the latest life extension
[19:56.560 --> 20:03.600]  technologies they're being given. Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination
[20:03.600 --> 20:09.440]  of toxins. That bears repeating. Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[20:09.440 --> 20:15.920]  And Pro EM-1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health. Pro EM-1 is a powerful liquid

[20:58.400 --> 21:04.640]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[21:04.640 --> 21:09.280]  they're restricting civilian's rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and two
[21:09.280 --> 21:15.280]  together? Infidel body armor can stop every round. Including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds. Is
[21:15.280 --> 21:23.680]  reasonably priced and fully legal. But for how long? Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com. Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L
[21:23.680 --> 21:30.720]  BodyArmor.com. Infidel Body Armor. Just won't quit. We the people grow cotton,
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.400]  wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit,
[21:34.400 --> 21:38.880]  then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest. Forcing taxes to service debt.
[21:38.880 --> 21:42.640]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[21:42.640 --> 21:46.400]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.400]  Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call for
[21:50.400 --> 21:59.520]  your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[22:00.480 --> 22:04.960]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[22:04.960 --> 22:10.560]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger was drought or
[22:10.560 --> 22:16.560]  food delivered to our gas tanks or our food sold to other countries or food so expensive that only
[22:16.560 --> 22:21.760]  those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we have just experienced the most effective
[22:21.760 --> 22:27.520]  way to lose your freedom, liberty and security without even a fight. Government regulation.
[22:27.520 --> 22:33.680]  After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance, the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food
[22:33.680 --> 22:39.040]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[22:39.040 --> 22:44.800]  regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations. If you've ever been warned to get food while you
[22:44.800 --> 22:54.880]  can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. That's 800-409-5633
[22:54.880 --> 23:06.720]  or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. Curious about what comes next? Next is the
[23:06.720 --> 23:11.840]  feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by
[23:11.840 --> 23:18.640]  burglars. Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV. You asked for it. We listened and we
[23:18.640 --> 23:24.400]  made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model. The brightness of our new fake TV
[23:24.400 --> 23:31.120]  is equivalent to a 40-inch TV. It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away
[23:31.120 --> 23:36.320]  from home. And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your
[23:36.320 --> 23:42.320]  house and move on to an easier target. The new brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes
[23:42.320 --> 23:53.600]  free shipping. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to

[24:17.280 --> 24:23.840]  Central Standard Time. We're here and I just tell it like it is. I love humanity. I love good
[24:23.840 --> 24:30.160]  innocent people, but the people I don't like are the folks that think being cynical and corrupt
[24:30.720 --> 24:36.000]  is a winning attribute and who think going along with things is a good idea and who are so
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.280]  intellectually lazy that they're not aware of what's going on. I mean the government is gearing
[24:41.280 --> 24:51.840]  up for total and absolute societal collapse. And we are sitting here right in the middle of this.
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.960]  And then we try to point it out and we're the bad guys. Look at this article. Look at this headline.
[25:00.160 --> 25:06.080]  Military says no presidential authorization needed to quell civil disturbances.
[25:06.080 --> 25:12.720]  DoD instruction seeks to abolish posse commentatis, Greece skids for military coup.
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.400]  A recent Department of Defense instruction alters, just an instruction, that's all you need. Maybe
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.240]  they'll instruct you to jump off a cliff. You'll have to do it. Alters the US code applying to the
[25:24.240 --> 25:30.880]  military's involvement in domestic law enforcement by allowing US troops to quote, quell civil
[25:30.880 --> 25:36.160]  disturbances, that's a quote, domestically without any presidential authorization.
[25:37.120 --> 25:42.080]  See first there's no Congress needed, totally unconstitutional. Then NATO's the boss,
[25:42.080 --> 25:49.040]  then the president's the boss, then with the military. Now, what's the number one threat
[25:49.040 --> 25:56.720]  in history to take over a sovereign system? Military. What do you add to military?
[25:56.720 --> 26:02.320]  military. Cesar did good bringing in the military, taking over.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.400]  I like the Latin American coup d'etats.
[26:10.720 --> 26:18.720]  Large fry, pie, large coffee. I mean, this is just so out of control.
[26:19.600 --> 26:25.600]  Greasing the skids for the de facto military coup in America along with the wholesale
[26:25.600 --> 26:30.640]  abolition of posse comitatus. I mean, it was a big deal when they created plans,
[26:30.640 --> 26:34.720]  if there was a nuclear attack that took out Congress and the president to let a general
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.960]  respond. And they have gone back and forth allowing that in US code law.
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.800]  Now you've got the executive telling Congress you can't see PDD 51. You can't see our civil
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.920]  unrest plans. That's classified. They tell the Armed Services Committee and the National
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.800]  Security Committee, and they tell the Homeland Security Committee that. I mean, that's Congress,
[26:56.800 --> 27:04.320]  the power of the purse. That's the bosses of this. That's the football coaches who then give
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.600]  the executor, the president, the quarterback. But now it's not even the quarterback taking over,
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.320]  now the players. And again, the Congress, they're all going along with,
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.040]  well, the military can deal with the American people if something happens to the president.
[27:21.040 --> 27:24.640]  There's not even a discussion of chain of command, Secretary of State,
[27:25.600 --> 27:29.680]  Vice President, Secretary of State, Speaker of the House on down the line.
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.520]  Now it's just, we don't even need that. It's the military. And the military says,
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.720]  and we've got to get these clips from last year and play them today if we can.
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.200]  I just thought of this when they said, no, we got our orders from NATO now. So this actually is a
[27:43.200 --> 27:52.160]  NATO coup over America. Just like in Ireland and in Greece and in Italy, they go, we just appoint
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.280]  the leaders now, the finance ministers, the presidents, the prime ministers from Goldman Sachs.
[27:57.280 --> 28:03.120]  We don't have elections anymore. We just appoint the emergency restructuring. And as a technocrat,
[28:03.120 --> 28:13.200]  bankers know best. You signed on to our debt, now we say you're in debt.
[28:13.200 --> 28:15.840]  And the average person doesn't know the three branches of government.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.040]  They sure don't know what this is. And man, they say they're gearing up in this for collapse,
[28:25.040 --> 28:32.480]  civil unrest. And then it references, of course, the new army manuals that are three years old,
[28:32.480 --> 28:35.680]  the deal with reeducation camps. Folks, they actually call them that,
[28:36.240 --> 28:39.120]  how they're gonna interrogate us, how they're gonna break up our families.
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.800]  I mean, my God, they're gonna start it. They're gonna come after everybody.
[28:44.160 --> 28:47.360]  Just like they're telling state police all over the country, prepare to confiscate Christian's
[28:47.360 --> 28:52.160]  guns. And let me tell you, the average public will follow orders. The average person, if they
[28:52.160 --> 28:57.360]  told them, I'm not joking here, bring your five-year-old for execution, the average American
[28:57.360 --> 29:07.440]  would do it. I mean, let me tell you, I'm about to throw up. And I try to take more time off,
[29:07.440 --> 29:13.760]  I can't do it. And this is driving me to the point of just pulling my hair out, because
[29:17.680 --> 29:21.760]  we need to be repenting, folks, and on our knees before God.
[29:21.760 --> 29:25.600]  And then we need to be at the city councils, the county commissioners, the state houses,
[29:25.600 --> 29:30.240]  the street corners. We should be running around like our hair is on fire over this,
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.240]  but we're not. It's like, okay, more tyranny. Okay, they're spying on us without warrants.
[29:34.240 --> 29:37.840]  Okay, they put cancer viruses in the vaccines. Okay, they admit they're doing it to reduce
[29:37.840 --> 29:44.080]  our population. So what, who cares about those documents? Oh, so the GMO sterilizing the rodents,
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.560]  so what? Oh, we're getting sterilized, so what? I mean, it's just nightmarish.
[29:48.560 --> 29:56.320]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:03.200 --> 31:08.240]  into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me
[31:08.240 --> 31:13.280]  to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[31:13.280 --> 31:18.720]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[31:18.720 --> 31:24.080]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer,
[31:24.080 --> 31:29.440]  and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and
[31:29.440 --> 31:34.800]  discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[31:34.800 --> 31:41.280]  need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds

[33:13.200 --> 33:14.400]  Infowars.com
[33:14.400 --> 33:26.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.240 --> 33:43.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to go to your phone calls and get to the news.
[33:43.440 --> 33:50.160]  I'm going to get to all the ongoing Obama scandals the next hour. Take your calls on that as well.
[33:50.960 --> 33:59.680]  It's just this, global crime syndicates have used our open society to come in and to infiltrate and
[33:59.680 --> 34:04.720]  to basically fully take over, except they haven't taken over the free press completely. They haven't
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.480]  taken over you individually yet, and they haven't totally bankrupted you yet, but they are devaluing
[34:10.480 --> 34:18.000]  the dollar now at an accelerated rate. Everywhere I go, things cost more. Everywhere I go, I see
[34:18.800 --> 34:24.400]  security everywhere and people being bossed around and felt up and military on the streets,
[34:24.400 --> 34:30.000]  even in Austin and TSA, that we are being prepared and it's in all the army manuals.
[34:31.440 --> 34:35.600]  So we need to understand that if we don't expose this, they're going to go ahead with the plan
[34:35.600 --> 34:42.400]  to roll all this out. And the branding behind the scenes has gone from Al-Qaeda is who they're
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.480]  going to be fighting, but they're going to be fighting people wearing John Deere caps,
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.640]  literally. That's who, if you go to the urban warfare drills, we've shown you the footage,
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.560]  that's who they're trying to fight. And that's what their own FBI, MIAC, Homeland Security
[34:54.560 --> 34:58.640]  manuals that are in the news. And I'd covered that four years ago and it was crazy.
[34:58.640 --> 35:04.000]  Now everybody listening knows that's been all over mainstream media with big sis,
[35:04.000 --> 35:15.200]  defending it. And I'm not trying to scare you. I am climbing the walls on air and off of air.
[35:16.480 --> 35:25.600]  I am climbing the walls, trying to figure out how to stop this, trying to figure out how to get
[35:25.600 --> 35:33.520]  the general public out of their trance. I am doing the very, very, very, very, very best I can.
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.320]  And I talked to so many people, prominent people off record, you name it. And they go, yeah, no,
[35:40.320 --> 35:45.200]  it's about what you say. I have to apologize. It just sounded so crazy, but I guess we didn't look
[35:45.200 --> 35:48.880]  at history and yes, it's probably worse than you're saying. Well, what are you going to do
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.360]  about it? There's nothing you can do, the public's too dumb. And I'm not going to say
[35:53.360 --> 36:00.240]  you can do, the public's too dumb, too narcissistic. And so we're just gonna sit here.
[36:01.680 --> 36:07.120]  I mean, it's never a majority that stops things. It's never a majority that takes over and does
[36:07.120 --> 36:18.480]  bad things. But my main frustration is also that I care about people. I have extreme empathy,
[36:18.480 --> 36:25.120]  not sympathy. Once something's already happened, I don't just have a fake sympathy. I don't say
[36:25.120 --> 36:32.960]  fake little sympathetic things to act like I care. I get hit in my stomach. I literally
[36:34.000 --> 36:41.040]  channel what I see other people going through. And it is torture. I mean, having
[36:41.840 --> 36:44.320]  a lot of empathy means I have a lot of perception.
[36:44.320 --> 36:51.040]  I'm very alive. So are you out there? I run into our listeners on the street and just the
[36:51.040 --> 36:55.440]  lightning in their eyes, the spirit they have. And so I know you know the frustration, but there's
[36:55.440 --> 37:04.240]  also I'd rather be enjoying fine art, fine music. I would rather be spending time outside. I would
[37:04.240 --> 37:10.080]  rather be spending time with my family. I resent the New World Order. I resent the fact that
[37:10.080 --> 37:18.560]  they're so wicked and so stunted and twisted. And I'm just so sick of not just the establishment
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.720]  being evil and corrupt, but the general public being that way. And that's what the establishment
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.840]  always says. The time's off record. I've been offered jobs by the establishment over the years.
[37:29.840 --> 37:34.000]  They're always like, Alex, the public's even worse than we are. They would tear you apart
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.040]  if they could. They hate you because you're talented. And of course, that's an appeal
[37:39.040 --> 37:47.120]  to arrogance and appeal to ego. But it's true. But I will not join evil so I can sit back and
[37:47.120 --> 37:51.600]  with them and laugh at everybody and then do everything I can to keep people in the dark
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.280]  forever. See, that's the thing. They've done this to the public.
[37:58.320 --> 38:05.440]  They've made people immoral and corrupt and wicked. They've certainly thrown fuel on the fire.
[38:05.440 --> 38:15.680]  And my spirit cannot join with evil. But it doesn't matter at some levels because it just
[38:15.680 --> 38:20.960]  becomes evil anyways. Or they paint you as evil so that even though you do good work
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.360]  and wanna help people, they will paint you as evil so the weak minded see you as evil.
[38:25.360 --> 38:35.680]  And so whatever you do gets turned to evil. But it's not gonna go on much longer.
[38:37.360 --> 38:39.840]  And the rotting is accelerating.
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.720]  And I just think about the foster children drugged on 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 drugs with their teeth
[38:48.720 --> 38:57.600]  falling out, dying of convulsions. I think about just the mutation of humanity. It's like an alien
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.840]  species came down on the earth, took over the government, and is running a computer program
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.360]  with how to incrementally dumb us down, soft kill us, medium kill us, and then hard kill us.
[39:07.360 --> 39:12.960]  Cuz they kill you right away, people would resist. But if they slowly kill you, no one knows where
[39:12.960 --> 39:17.120]  it's coming from unless you scientifically study it. And then it's all there. And you're like,
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.560]  my God, look, they say they're doing it. And the public's like, sure they are, cuz they're
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.640]  already in the throes of it. And then you can't get mad at them because they've already been
[39:26.640 --> 39:35.520]  taken over by it. And then you run into other smart people and they have decided to use the
[39:35.520 --> 39:49.040]  techniques of control on other people around them so they can, quote, get ahead. And then that just
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.040]  adds to the whole culture of other people going, well, I'll just cheat to get ahead.
[39:53.040 --> 39:58.880]  And then everyone gets more and more selfish and society collapses.
[40:00.560 --> 40:03.120]  I mean, we went out on the street and four out of ten people
[40:03.120 --> 40:06.000]  said that they should be able to kill their children up to age three. The state should be
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.040]  able to kill children that are healthy. And it's a woman's right to choose to kill her child.
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.560]  It's a woman's right to have both their breasts removed before they even have any signs of cancer.
[40:18.560 --> 40:23.520]  Well, if it's a right, better go out and do it. It's a woman's right to get a Gardasil shot
[40:23.520 --> 40:29.040]  that doesn't protect you from the papillomavirus and the cancer, the insert says it, but so what?
[40:29.040 --> 40:36.160]  It's hyped up. It's what women are doing. And they go, boys, little dirty boys,
[40:36.160 --> 40:42.960]  you could give girls the virus. You need to take the shot. And then it turns out the shot
[40:42.960 --> 40:46.480]  just so happens to lower fertility and give you autoimmune diseases
[40:46.480 --> 40:49.760]  a large percentage of the time and kill people as well.
[40:50.800 --> 40:56.160]  And it's like, big deal, it kills people. Big deal, flesh eating and other bacterias are killing
[40:56.160 --> 41:03.040]  hundreds of thousands a year. Big deal. Deer all the time are jumping through car windows killing
[41:03.040 --> 41:08.480]  two, three, 400 a year, depending on the year. Terrorism kills less than 100, but it doesn't
[41:08.480 --> 41:15.680]  matter. It's so sexy to roll around in fear and be scared of terrorists under every bush.
[41:15.680 --> 41:25.600]  And more and more, it is just mind-controlled, arrested development, bumbling people.
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.920]  And it doesn't make me feel good that they're so stupid, that they're so pathetic,
[41:31.920 --> 41:40.880]  that they're so weak, that they're so cowardly. It freaks me out.
[41:40.880 --> 41:48.400]  And it makes me wanna remove myself from society. Cuz I walk out of a restaurant with my kids and
[41:48.400 --> 41:51.760]  a motorcycle gang sitting there, revving their things, looking at me like they think they're
[41:51.760 --> 41:56.960]  tough. I mean, you might actually be able to deal with me maybe, but not before I go like a
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.920]  caveman and literally bash two or three of your brains out. And I'm scared of that, man.
[42:01.920 --> 42:08.160]  I can't put up with all the fake people anymore. I can't put up with all the fake people anymore.
[42:08.160 --> 42:14.880]  I can't put up with all the fake people anymore. All the phony tough.
[42:16.080 --> 42:22.160]  I just am so sick of the gangs, the cop gangs, the motorcycle gangs, the bureaucrat gangs,
[42:22.160 --> 42:27.040]  the lisping fake liberal gangs, the good old boy gangs, the country club gangs,
[42:27.920 --> 42:38.080]  the trendy gangs. They're not real people. They're these robots in schools of swimming
[42:38.080 --> 42:44.160]  amoebas. And then I go study the actual controllers of the entire program.
[42:49.040 --> 42:55.200]  And they're not even that smart. I mean, they would know you're not gonna get away with this.
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.800]  It will blow back on you. And then they even say that in a lot of their writings. They go,
[42:58.800 --> 43:02.400]  but it doesn't matter, we wanna do it. Because all there is is the darkness.
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.800]  All there is is doing something bad cuz you can do it. All there is is screwing people over cuz
[43:06.800 --> 43:10.720]  you can get away with it. And that's what the smart guys do. That's what the winners do.
[43:10.720 --> 43:12.240]  That's what the cool people do.
[43:22.400 --> 43:26.080]  I mean, I sit here and I read these army manuals where they're training for high treason
[43:26.080 --> 43:32.960]  to lock us up and torture us and reeducate us. And no media will even pick it up cuz that's just
[43:32.960 --> 43:38.000]  too hardcore. No media will pick up the paper targets where they're trying to shoot little kids.
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.320]  And it was confirmed, but no one will cover it. But us?
[43:49.680 --> 43:57.680]  You think I like being the most hardcore, most awake, most focused? It is dangerous.
[43:57.680 --> 44:07.280]  I don't know, this world is so fake. It's so plastic.
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.320]  It is such a manifest fraud that I just can't partake of it.
[44:17.920 --> 44:23.280]  None of it, almost all of it is diseased and rotten. And there are some good things there.
[44:23.280 --> 44:31.120]  But my God, if we don't say no to all of this now, I mean, if people don't really start freaking out
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.600]  over what's going on and recognizing it and getting out of your learned helplessness and
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.520]  out of your trance, it's over, folks. What's going to happen is going to make, and it's already
[44:41.520 --> 44:49.760]  ongoing, what happened in the government orgies of death in the last century, pale and significance.
[44:49.760 --> 44:55.680]  The United Nations is in mainstream news, back of the paper, like it's a good thing,
[44:56.320 --> 45:02.800]  going into villages in Central South America, Africa, and Asia, and killing whole villages.
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.480]  I mean, they go in and they like something out of
[45:14.080 --> 45:17.440]  more locks and Eloise, Planet of the Apes, whatever you want to call it.
[45:17.440 --> 45:20.080]  I mean, they go in and they chase them down and they kill them.
[45:21.840 --> 45:25.520]  And then I sit there on the phone with Bloomberg writers and I'm going,
[45:25.520 --> 45:28.240]  you know, our government did this and that. It's on record. We're not going to discuss
[45:28.240 --> 45:31.760]  that and giggle. Well, you know that the UN is doing this. Can I send you the article?
[45:32.320 --> 45:35.680]  Yeah, right. And it's just they're like children. They have no idea.
[45:36.800 --> 45:41.600]  And the people that write the articles normalizing killing people think they're
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.840]  like on some winning team doing this. None of you are going to get out of this.
[45:45.840 --> 45:49.760]  Your kids aren't going to get out of this. None of you are going to get out of this, you idiots.
[45:54.400 --> 45:55.600]  Oh, my God, help me.
[46:03.200 --> 46:07.520]  So the army's preparing for massive civil disturbances and societal collapse
[46:08.160 --> 46:10.800]  and to operate outside the president or Congress.
[46:10.800 --> 46:17.440]  Do you I mean, I mean, that's such a big deal. In fact, I'm even surprised by that.
[46:17.440 --> 46:20.000]  You would think the criminals that run the government would would you know,
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.200]  they've got their own puppets. But I mean, I guess that's the ultimate puppeteering.
[46:23.200 --> 46:26.720]  Now they just got to buy off the generals like the Nazis did with the Vichy French
[46:26.720 --> 46:31.280]  and have them stand down or they can do a big false flag, nuke Congress when it's in session,
[46:32.080 --> 46:34.480]  whatever, and then just say the military is in charge.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.040]  And, you know, I've been hearing a lot of talk about, you know, go after Obama,
[46:39.040 --> 46:42.400]  do this and that he needs to be impeached, but nothing physical needs to happen to him.
[46:42.400 --> 46:46.960]  They could they could go get rid of Obama and then oh, we'll get behind the military
[46:46.960 --> 46:50.240]  restoring order. That's what everybody keeps saying. It'll just be something even worse.
[46:51.520 --> 46:55.200]  And you can see all the preparations, man, because they know it's all about to collapse.
[46:55.840 --> 46:58.720]  They engineered it this way, but I don't think they can reverse it now.
[46:58.720 --> 47:01.600]  We've gotten that deep into it. It's like a perpetual motion machine
[47:01.600 --> 47:04.720]  or a doomsday machine. You know, once it's counting down,
[47:04.720 --> 47:10.000]  it's very hard to shut down. It's counting down now. It's two minutes to midnight.
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.400]  And they're lining up, you know, they're uncloaking. And I'm like, red alert,
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.480]  red alert here. Here it is. Red alert, red alert. We've been named as the enemy,
[47:20.480 --> 47:23.600]  red alert. People are like, why don't you shut up, you extremist?
[47:23.600 --> 47:34.320]  So what do they take my bank account? I'm going to salute them. And so they're going to be nice to me.
[47:42.960 --> 47:46.880]  Well, what's going to save us is everybody who laughs on the surface when you really talk to
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.760]  them for a minute, they'll lower the laugh and you'll see they're scared. They're scared,
[47:51.760 --> 47:58.160]  they know. So at least people out there know that there's something dangerous going on.
[47:58.160 --> 48:04.560]  Your sixth sense that God gave you, you know. But here's the thing, you don't know how bad
[48:04.560 --> 48:11.520]  it really is. And only the realization of how much trouble we're in is going to get us out of this.
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.440]  And I'm telling you, if you study criminology, especially in domesticated populations,
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.120]  you can go to a horrible third world warren of crime and look at the statistics. If somebody
[48:21.120 --> 48:26.960]  tries to corner a woman or somebody tries to sucks a kid into a van, the kid runs immediately
[48:26.960 --> 48:32.560]  and doesn't go. The woman fights back. You go to civilized Western nations of domesticated slobs,
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.400]  seven, eight times out of ten in the last 30, 40 years of the criminology,
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.080]  a woman can know she's being kidnapped to be put in a van and she still is so scared to admit it
[48:44.080 --> 48:51.920]  is happening. She'll go and do it. And men will do it. And that's why you can walk up to people
[48:51.920 --> 48:56.960]  and say, we want Nazi Germany and America to keep us safe. And so Obama can take our guns.
[48:56.960 --> 49:02.560]  And nine out of ten people in LA will sign it because they're scared and they just want to do
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.920]  what the government says. Yeah, we've actually gone out with Mark Dice and said, let's,
[49:09.920 --> 49:17.520]  and you know, said, let's basically bring in fascist Nazi rule for Obama. And they say yes.
[49:17.520 --> 49:22.560]  And they know what Nazis are, but they still, they hear Obama. Oh, I'm part of the team.
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.360]  It's a woman's right to kill her child up to age three. And the women are like, yes,
[49:27.360 --> 49:33.440]  I like that. That's power. See the powerless, who've never had a chance to have any small power
[49:33.440 --> 49:38.560]  that they built themselves, then don't appreciate it and know how dangerous it is.
[49:38.560 --> 49:43.920]  So then they just imagine like a moth to flame that it's some great fulfillment they're going
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.440]  to have. And then they see through the black uniforms and the nighttime Nazi rallies,
[49:49.440 --> 49:56.320]  they see this majesty, this reflected glory that they are going to be empowered
[49:57.520 --> 49:58.800]  even in their own destruction.
[50:02.960 --> 50:07.440]  Because they were never made to hunt as children. They were never made to fight as children.
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.080]  They were never put through tribal rituals, good, wholesome, ancient rituals.
[50:12.080 --> 50:16.720]  They were put through modern rituals. When I say modern rituals, 6,000 year old and up.
[50:18.480 --> 50:24.960]  Dehumanizing rituals of fraud where the headdress is why you have status, not because
[50:27.920 --> 50:30.880]  you instinctively know where to take people to find the game.
[50:30.880 --> 50:37.680]  It's a world of fraud. It's planet hoax.
[50:40.960 --> 50:44.640]  And I'm just looking for people that are still human and have a soul and a heart
[50:44.640 --> 50:47.120]  who want to stand against this because it's the only shot we've got.
[50:49.280 --> 50:54.560]  And I'll take your calls and John B. Wells is coming up.
[50:54.560 --> 51:02.000]  There's so much news here on this Friday edition.

[54:21.360 --> 54:31.520]  All right, I have literally got no exaggeration. Like 15 different video clips I want to get
[54:31.520 --> 54:41.440]  to. I've got clips, an article up at Infowars.com from a local news station where the robbers
[54:41.440 --> 54:44.880]  come in the home invasion and then put the guy in his closet, but he has his guns in
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.080]  the closet. So he comes out and shoots them. And they're like, the police are not going
[54:50.080 --> 54:57.360]  to charge the homeowner. He's lucky. The greatest crime is defending yourself in this country.
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.680]  Robbers shove homeowner in closet where he kept his guns. They got bandits out there
[55:03.680 --> 55:11.880]  in their clown outfits talking about it. And then we got a bunch of, we got all the big
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.600]  scandal stuff, which is important, because it is important to bring people to justice.
[55:15.600 --> 55:23.120]  But then you find out the IRS official, official that ran all the stuff for Obama, obviously,
[55:23.120 --> 55:29.220]  and Holder and others and those above them, that talk show host and media journalists
[55:29.220 --> 55:30.220]  would get audited.
[55:30.220 --> 55:34.200]  And now that those that have complained are being fired, cuz you're not supposed to talk
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.840]  about how you got harassed. You're not supposed to stand up for yourself. Again, that's the
[55:38.840 --> 55:44.880]  greatest crime. Shoot robbers, you're bad. Get audited for your political views, speak
[55:44.880 --> 55:45.880]  out against it.
[55:45.880 --> 55:49.660]  You're bad, you're fired. I think that's why I get so wound up. I come in here and
[55:49.660 --> 55:52.980]  read all this news and see it all, then I get on the air. I'm just sick of it, man.
[55:52.980 --> 55:56.600]  I'm sick of the tyrants and I know you're sick of it too. And we're gonna beat them
[55:56.600 --> 56:03.020]  together. But I think at the same time, we've got to admit how bad it is. Because then we
[56:03.020 --> 56:04.520]  know we've got to turn this around.
[56:04.520 --> 56:12.640]  We've got to stop putting a perfume on this thing, this pig. So we got all that coming
[56:12.640 --> 56:17.340]  in. And we got a bunch of other clips here today. I think we're gonna premiere tonight
[56:17.340 --> 56:21.880]  on the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central. He says it's done, but I'm gonna see it today
[56:21.880 --> 56:24.080]  and see if I wanna add anything.
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.920]  We did this, I don't know, six months ago. And it's one of the literally over 100 things
[56:28.920 --> 56:33.100]  we've never gotten done, cuz we just do so much and then never complete it. Because we
[56:33.100 --> 56:36.600]  love liberty, have a great team. Cuz once you work here and see all this, you don't
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.040]  wanna stop fighting it, be it upset you.
[56:40.040 --> 56:43.680]  And by the grace of God, we've assembled a really good group of people. All of us need
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.940]  your prayers, cuz to be in and around this is very stressful. And I need your prayers
[56:48.940 --> 56:56.960]  as well. But we did something really fun to try to illustrate the Second Amendment, dealing
[56:56.960 --> 56:58.520]  with laser beams and particle beams.
[56:58.520 --> 57:02.820]  I went out and bought some of the most powerful consumer grade. You can get even more powerful
[57:02.820 --> 57:07.240]  industrial ones, but it takes a license and stuff. We could have done that. But we went
[57:07.240 --> 57:13.800]  out and bought like 400, $500 lasers, a blue-white laser and a green laser. And we recreated
[57:13.800 --> 57:22.880]  a laser battle with Star Wars figures. This will definitely go viral.
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.600]  And then it's filled with news about directed energy weapons. It's got 50 cals shooting
[57:27.600 --> 57:33.320]  armor. I mean, it's pretty wild video, and it's got me in there talking about it. So
[57:33.320 --> 57:36.760]  that's gonna premiere tonight on the Nightly News. And if you're not a prisonplanet.tv
[57:36.760 --> 57:42.400]  member, I mean, we need our own platformers of all the censorship happening on YouTube.
[57:42.400 --> 57:47.000]  We post all the stuff we do on YouTube a day or so later, but they try to censor it. We
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.000]  have to fight and file in court to keep this thing up. I mean, it's a big hassle, but we
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  do it.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.760]  But if you just wanna go see it all in high def and in high quality and see it when you
[57:56.760 --> 58:03.300]  want and be able to give up to 30, 40 people your passcode, 11 people, you can simultaneously
[58:03.300 --> 58:08.280]  log into the website at any one time. But most people won't be logging in at the same
[58:08.280 --> 58:12.400]  time. So I'd say you can share it with 30, 40 people, credit original username passcode
[58:12.400 --> 58:16.720]  with your 595 a month membership and share it with friends and family. We call it Operation

[58:25.280 --> 58:32.480]  find a future for humanity based on decency and truth and not the science of lies and

[59:06.980 --> 59:12.540]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[59:12.540 --> 59:18.000]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.640]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening

[59:53.720 --> 01:00:05.320]  Reaching war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:21.120]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GTN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:40.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and broadcasting worldwide. John B. Wells is coming up. We'll
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.040]  take calls in this hour. Into the next hour, we're gonna talk about all the latest scandals
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.520]  on the IRS, the wiretapping, the police state, and really the big news, military says no
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.200]  presidential authorization needed to quell civil disturbances.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:01.960]  Man, that is a military industrial complex, total coup d'etat. That's what Eisenhower
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:08.580]  warned of. And I mean, right now, this even blew me away. And why not? They said NATO
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:15.880]  commands our military now. So why not just say now that this is VT French stuff. And
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.600]  that's why every sports show, every show, worship the military.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.520]  It doesn't take care of the people that are in the military. It's create a cult of the
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.480]  military, do whatever it says, as they train for war against this God Almighty. And I'm
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:42.020]  not using the Lord's name in vain, I'm crying out to God. I just repent to God for everything
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.320]  I've done, even though I try to be a good person.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.840]  My gut instinct is just get right with God. Okay, man, this is really bad. You read what
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.520]  they're getting ready for, civil collapse and all this stuff. Man, they're gonna kill
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.640]  the dollar, they're gonna hammer down. Let me tell you, this spoiled rotten general public's
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.360]  gonna go absolutely ape.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:11.840]  Globalists know exactly what they're doing. And I've been too close to this too long.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.920]  I mean, I'm not even really prepared and ready for this. I'm gonna tell you what it is, I'm
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:30.440]  tired of evil. I'm sick of evil being sold as sexy. Evil is a child sitting there in
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:39.360]  burnt brown, yellow grass, emaciated with their ribs sticking out with buzzards waiting
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.320]  for them to collapse and die.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:52.600]  That's your sexiness to your evil. And I wish this could be stopped. I get up here with
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.640]  bravada and just get real cynical and dark satire and try to bull my way through all
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:05.780]  this. And the reason Infowars has been successful despite all the odds is people who have discernment
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:12.560]  know I'm totally for real. That's why every cosmology created out there by the enemy is
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.120]  that I'm not real because they're not real and they hate it.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.200]  They have sold their souls and they hate me because I still have my soul. And let me tell
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:30.640]  you something, and that's the answer to everything. They hate you because you have a soul. They
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:45.000]  hate you because you value genuineness and honorableness and steadfastness. They hate
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.340]  you because you didn't sell out.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.060]  That's why they hate good people and they're never gonna stop till they've killed every
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.440]  one of us. You understand that? Who did the Soviets go after? They go after their own
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.080]  communists if they found out it was somebody who was really good, who just played along
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.640]  and who didn't enjoy it.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.040]  And they'd go after other evil people that they were afraid of because they were so evil.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:13.200]  They go after everybody. There's no peace. There's no rest for the wicked. All there
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:20.780]  is is hell on earth. And I see too much, man. Let me tell you, I know why people don't wanna
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:27.680]  see this. I know why people wanna be dumbed down and wanna go get drunk and forget the
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.320]  whole world.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:40.400]  Because being alive is the biggest trip of all. Being aware, having clarity, clarity
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:50.280]  is so hardcore. People just can't handle it. You want the truth? You can't handle the truth,
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:57.560]  it's a quote, a famous movie. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. Your phone call's

[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:42.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Friday worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:49.640]  It is the 17th day, ladies and gentlemen, of May 2013. We've got two hours left. We're
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.760]  now into the second hour. I know XM Channel 244 joins us and a lot of other AM and FM
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.960]  affiliates. We're going to be joined in the balance of the hour by John B. Wells, Saturday
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.400]  host and very popular host of Coast to Coast AM. And I love their whole team over there
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.480]  but just amazing guy and of course he's got a professional voice talent, one of the top
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.080]  voice talents in the country so it's not hard on the ears like listening to my show. And
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.000]  we're going to be talking to him about all these scandals and more in a moment. But I've
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.760]  got to tell listeners if you go up to infowars.com right now there is giant breaking news.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.780]  The army has come out and it showed up in the US code that they're now saying they're
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:37.760]  outside of Congress and the president during any civil disturbance, widespread or localized
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:45.600]  civil disturbances. They're calling it a rule change and an instruction. Now DOD is telling
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:52.240]  people now you can't have your plastic 3D printable gun no law no nothing. The DOD orders
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:58.600]  you Cody Wilson last week do not do this. They are now they call it an instruction but
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.800]  it's now showed up in the US code.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:09.100]  And they are, I mean, ladies and gentlemen, it was bombshell seismic if you know world
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:17.320]  history and the Constitution last year when the DOD and three different congressional
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.480]  hearings the Joint Chiefs of Staff including the chairman Dempsey told Congress. We don't
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.880]  need you for appropriations.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.000]  We don't need you for war making authority or any response. We get that from NATO. It'd
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.560]  be bad enough if he said from the president who does not make war who they execute what
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.280]  Congress says cuz you don't want a dictator. I mean, that's treason, red alert, insane,
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.440]  third world dictatorship, North Korea, run screaming for the hills.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.680]  I mean, if you try that in communist China, they arrest you. I mean, it's at least gotta
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:58.960]  be the big party group. I mean, this is dictatorship. Now what Eisenhower warned of the undue influence
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.760]  whether sought or unsought of the military industrial complex controlled by a technocratic
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.480]  scientific elite, that was the full quote.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.520]  And folks, they're now saying the DOD and they've been all over marking their territory,
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.280]  every town, every city, checkpoints, black helicopter raids, buying off police chiefs,
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:24.680]  Delta Force running free speech zones, beating people up in Seattle. I told an Esquire writer
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.640]  that he didn't believe me cuz he was there.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.040]  He went looked at him and goes, it's in all the newspapers at that time. I never heard
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.860]  that. Really, you didn't hear that? I've interviewed the police chiefs 15 years ago of major cities
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.480]  like San Antonio, where Delta Force shows up and goes, we want you to be our friend.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:45.320]  Here's 100 grand. The police chief says, excuse me, I was in the army in Vietnam and intelligence.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:51.400]  Are you trying to buy me in a clandestine operation? You're gonna do a special forces
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:58.840]  operation on me to buy me to join you?
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.200]  And they said, we're sorry you feel that way. And it turned out, he thought it was a test
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.840]  of loyalty. But he was still like, the army shouldn't be involved. And then he found out,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:13.200]  no, no, no, the mayor, the fire chief, they all took the money.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.920]  What did the Vichy French do? They, for five years, Hitler quietly bought off nine out
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.520]  of ten of the general staff of the French military. The French just stood down. The
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:30.240]  blitzkrieg was not even real. They went after the British Expeditionary Force that was there
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.600]  and ran them to Dunkirk.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.840]  This is all mainline history. The French stood down. Two weeks into the attack, Hitler went
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:44.960]  to Paris to survey it. Went to the Eiffel Tower, went to the tomb of Napoleon. And that's
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:54.000]  how they took over Iraq. In 2003, they bought off the general staff, the Iraqis, 90 plus
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.320]  percent again stood down, same number, they bought them off.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.760]  Then everybody down to privates got cash. Private, here's 5,000 doing a good job. Captain,
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:12.580]  here's 50,000 doing a good job. General, here's 5 million. They did that to corrupt everybody.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.920]  America cares about you. We flew in 50 million, we're gonna serve it up to you. And after
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.560]  that they said, now you're gonna run narcotics back into America or we're gonna report that
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.620]  50 grand you got, Captain.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.400]  The captain says, well, I didn't know you shut me up, I'm not gonna do that. Really?
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.320]  Can you talk to me in your office for a minute? Captain, get that file out for me. Boom, right
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:45.200]  in the back of the head, thousands of officers, suicided. Boom. Yeah, yeah. All on record,
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.880]  that all came out.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.680]  That's what runs America. And now they've come out and said, the military will do whatever
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.600]  it wants in America, outside of the president and outside of Congress. And who runs the
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:02.520]  military? NATO, NATO, NATO. That's why we've had guests on that you know really represent
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.160]  the Pentagon, saying stuff to Obama lately that would just blew me away.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.540]  That's what's going on here. And that's all crystallizing now, ladies and gentlemen. This
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:15.780]  country is in the middle of a power struggle over who gets to be dictator. I mean, we are
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:20.160]  in incredible trouble. John B Wells, I appreciate you coming on. Keep it a little bit the next
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160]  hour if you can do it.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:26.920]  Got you on a little bit late here, jbwells.com. He is the Saturday host of Coast2CoastAM.com,
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:33.120]  addition to serving as an announcer for CBS The Late Show with Craig Kilborn. Wells has
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.920]  lent his voice to all of our shows, JFK, talk radio films, and appeared in several other
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.960]  movies. I'm not gonna go over his whole deal.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.840]  The Deadliest Catch and Gold Rush, love his voice, love his mind even more. And he's just
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:53.880]  been kicking butt at Coast2CoastAM.com. He's got CaravanToMidnight.com, what a great name,
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.280]  as one of his other sites. And he joins us. I just went into that breaking news, sir,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.600]  and we'll get into all the other news.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:06.800]  But what do you make of that, John B Wells, tied into the billions of bullets, the armored
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.040]  vehicles, all of it?
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.520]  And I think this country, Alex, first of all, thank you very much for having me on the program.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:21.420]  It's good to talk with you. I wish we could chat more often simply because on your program,
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:27.320]  we pretty much get to let it all hang out, to use that term from the dinosaurs, the dinosaur
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:36.080]  age. But what do I make of it? I think this country is in a terrible state of denial.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.160]  I really do. I think that John Lennon's song about keep them dope with religion and sex
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.260]  and TV, and you think you're so clever and classless and free, but you're still bleeping
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:50.340]  peasants as far as I can see. A working class hero is something to be. And I think we've
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:56.160]  been dope with religion and sex and TV. And when I say religion, I don't mean faith. I
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.320]  mean religion.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:06.000]  And this is so beautifully orchestrated. Somebody, either there really is one great dark power
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.280]  that runs this earth, as is stated in the Holy Scriptures.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:16.560]  Oh, it's not human. No, exactly. The more I study it, it is a entity. It is. Call it
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.840]  whatever you want. A dark force is running this. And that's what I've come down to is
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.920]  I'm facing this thing. And I just wish people knew how much peril they're in, John.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:31.200]  Well, the thing about it is, Alex, is what we have to remember is the ones who get it,
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:37.600]  and the ones who don't get it, are never gonna get it. And that's just, I'm afraid, that's
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:43.560]  just the cold, hard, harsh reality. We would like to think that we'll wake them up, we'll
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.560]  enlighten them, we'll rise up as one people, and we'll quell this evil.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.440]  But a lot of people are just gonna go right along with it. This is something that I find
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.400]  very interesting, not to stray too far away, cuz you ask the question, what do I make of
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.360]  all this? I think there's about to be a war against the civilian population, and I'll
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:04.520]  tell you why. Everywhere you go, if you look at every false flag operation through history,
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:10.480]  from the battleship Maine, to the Lusitania, to Pearl Harbor, to the Gulf of Tonkin, to
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.720]  9-11, on and on and on. These false flags were all in furtherance of developing a war-like
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.200]  atmosphere.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.800]  And what happens when you have a war going on? Well, the citizens die, the leaders largely
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:30.120]  are preserved, and it's business as usual. I mean, Germany was a highly sophisticated,
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.800]  still is, in those days was a highly sophisticated society, music, literature, art, everything.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.200]  And virtually the entire place was destroyed, look at them now, they're the ones propping
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.720]  up the entire European Union.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:48.640]  So people die, and business goes on, which goes back to the scripture, and I don't want
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:54.120]  to turn this into a sermon, but it's like the love of money is the root of all evil.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.920]  And this is all about money, and when you look at the money that has been made from
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:07.480]  these ongoing undeclared wars, such as Vietnam, Korea even, less to a lesser extent, but still
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.380]  Korea as well, and now this ongoing war on terror.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:16.480]  You can see that wherever there is chaos, you know that expression, follow the chaos,
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.080]  that's where the opportunity is. I'm thinking that the Middle East may be close to being
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:26.640]  tapped out, China and Russia got the oil deals, we didn't. It was all about oil in Iraq, but
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.880]  no, I don't think we got into the oil, we're still exporting oil.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:36.640]  And I'm thinking the next big playground, the next big boom town, sorry about the pun,
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.400]  is gonna be the US. I think that tearing down this society and then rebuilding it is gonna
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.000]  mean big bucks for somebody.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:55.960]  I totally agree with you, and it is very saddening to see it unfolding, but I think at the same
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:04.680]  time it's part of a test of society and culture. And this is what makes humanity great, is
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.720]  the adversity. And it's been, the liberty we had was so great, we became fat, dumb and
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.640]  happy generationally.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.120]  And so the checks and balances were so great that it held it back for a long time, but
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:22.800]  the evil grew in the secret places and got very big. And now it's out in the open and
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.900]  people who've been in denial are so invested in saying that it isn't real, that now they're
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.360]  gonna deny things even as the country burns.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.120]  Well look what's going on up there in these hearings, look at this so called Attorney
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.220]  General. And look, you know, I realized it opened my big mouth like this and I'm happy
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:45.640]  to be in league with you in this regard because you don't hold back and I kind of have to
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.720]  unless I'm able to come on with you. But let's look at this Attorney General.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.000]  Well stay there, let's stay there, let's get into the current scandals with John B. Wells
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.620]  of coast2coastam.com. Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com. This is not a
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.120]  game folks.

[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.560]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.240]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:20.380]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:26.400]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.080]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:36.960]  here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.280]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:47.920]  at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:54.080]  in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now at exposed123.com
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:22:01.080]  before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:31.080]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors

[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:09.180]  John B. Wells, Coast to Coast AM Saturdays joins us right now. You are getting into the
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:26.700]  scandal that's deepening right now. Of course, they're using the IRS to harass libertarians
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:32.380]  and patriots. Of course, the lady that ran it all is now over Obamacare. Now, they're
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.980]  gonna share your medical records everywhere. They're saying our military is run by NATO
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.100]  and is now even above the President. Well, why not? That's what it was when they said
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:47.520]  last year NATO was over it. And if they just say it in a lawyerly way, we're now in basically
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.580]  a military coup d'etat.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:55.220]  And to quote Carlos from Hop, which is French for coup d'etat, some gallows humor there.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.460]  So John B. Wells, you were getting to that point. Go ahead.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.740]  Well, I just think that we're in a cold civil war right now. I really do, and I know that's
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:06.740]  dangerous talk. I don't think I'm doing myself, and maybe not even you, as vocal as you are
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.620]  about these issues, any favors by saying something like that. But I would submit to you that
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:13.620]  we are in a cold civil war.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:18.520]  It just hasn't happened yet. You have a president up there that does nothing but deny. You have
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:24.060]  an attorney general that goes all the way back to the Oklahoma bombing. Wasn't he assistant
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:28.800]  attorney general under Clinton? He didn't know anything. He didn't know anything about
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.940]  Fast and Furious, didn't know anything about Benghazi, didn't know anything about the IRS
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:33.940]  scandal.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:37.620]  He didn't know anything about anything. He's just denied, denied, denied, denied. Alex,
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:43.780]  I bought a book, and I've got a little story for you in a minute. It's a quick one. I bought
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:48.060]  a little book, cost me 50 bucks. I found one copy on Amazon. And so I bought it, and it's
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.220]  called My New Order by Adolf Hitler. And it's mostly his speeches. If you get this book
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:58.100]  and you read it, you will see that you are experiencing virtually the same thing that's
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.400]  printed on these pages.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.020]  But here's something else. A friend of mine in Germany, you know, I would tease him all
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:11.380]  the time about this and that, Nazi this, Nazi that. And among the things that he told me,
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:15.560]  just pieces over the years were that he and his wife, if they speak in their dialect,
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.980]  their little colloquialisms and slang, the people who speak what they call bookish German
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:24.860]  have no idea what he's talking about. So I stored that piece of data. Then he said that
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.300]  even his dad said, why do you have to speak so bookish?
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.660]  And I stored that piece of data because dad thought he was just being a little bit too
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:39.700]  uptight. Then this gal came over from Munich. She was a yoga girl. And my friend said, Stephanie
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:44.580]  speaks very bookish German. Then eventually we started talking. We just brought up Mein
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:50.060]  Kampf and he said, John, that book made no sense to me whatsoever. I could not understand
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.620]  anything that he was trying to write.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:58.960]  The years went by and it came up again and he said, John, I read Mein Kampf in English
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.660]  and it made so much sense to me. And I thought, you mean you understood what was being written?
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:11.260]  He said, yes. I thought to myself, I wonder if that means that it was originally written
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:18.500]  in English and translated into German. In which case, how deep do these roots go?
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:23.780]  Wow. It's funny you bring that up. We were talking yesterday about mainline history,
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.180]  but it's not popularly known that our government and the British government actually funded
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.700]  Hitler and his rise and that he had a peace treaty with the British and a deal with the
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:37.700]  King of England, Edward VIII to launch World War II and then England was gonna join him
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.460]  and then they double crossed him.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:46.260]  And that's like mainline history. But no, but it's not on a history channel.
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:50.980]  That's right. And Wallis Simpson had nothing to do with Edward's abdication so that George
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:56.300]  could take over, nothing at all. It's because it was generally known in those circles that
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.180]  Edward and Adolf were buddy-buddy, and they were.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:06.020]  Well, yeah, he was German. But I mean, again, there you're informed. It wasn't about the
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:12.380]  divorce, but the general public's like the British were Nazis. Take Prince Philip, his
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:18.300]  cousin, the head of the Netherlands. He was an SS officer.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.180]  Pretty small club, isn't it, Alex?
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.380]  Yeah, founder of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:29.580]  Well, these people have the capacity to make very, very long range plans. Most citizens
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:37.140]  make a plan that's the length of their latest car loan. But these people plan 50 years,
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:41.820]  100 years, they understand that to shape a global society, it's gonna take a minute to
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.900]  do that. Because they'll meet, they'll be met with resistance if they try and push the
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:46.900]  agenda too quickly.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:54.220]  So they just push it slowly. It appears that we may perhaps have been and may in future
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:59.940]  even more so take orders from the United Nations. And I think we know that everywhere the United
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:05.940]  Nations shows up with their blue helmets and their rifles, chaos and hell comes with them.
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:11.200]  So since when did we start taking orders from the United Nations? Since when does some universal
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:19.940]  arms treaty apply to us? Well, I don't know. The only way that we can turn this around
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:26.620]  is to make our lists and do everything that we possibly can to remove people in office
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.260]  who shouldn't be there.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:33.300]  We can do this, but someone has to do the legwork. Someone has to do the research.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:37.740]  Exactly, and the general public has to have a psychological and spiritual break with these
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:42.660]  globalists. Because remember, there was no world government and we were kooks. Now it's
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.060]  here, but we're kooks because we don't want it. I mean, it's incredible. Stay there. John
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:50.180]  B. Wells is our guest. Call's coming up.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:30:01.100]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:05.480]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.600]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:16.100]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:21.300]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:26.660]  info wars team dot com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose thirty
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:34.140]  seven pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:38.580]  and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:43.300]  lost more than thirty seven pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:48.780]  challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot com and to order just three of their
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:54.100]  products. And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite

[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:44.540]  gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish

[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:08.740]  on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about. Threats that trample the
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:13.780]  American dream. You know what we all face a crashing economy that's forcing millions
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:18.860]  out of work and from their homes. Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:23.160]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease. The food you can

[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:13.020]  a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. You know why that was not done. There are exceptions
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:19.060]  to that rule. I do not know. However, again, Mr. Chairman, I don't know. I don't know.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:25.860]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know that I don't know.
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:30.040]  I just don't know. I don't know whether or not I just don't know. I don't know exactly
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:35.260]  how IRS constructed it. I don't I don't know when the subpoena was issued. Well, I don't
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:41.200]  know precisely. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the specific questions. I mean,
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.480]  I don't know what happened. Well, you know, you don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:52.320]  I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know when. I don't know. I'm not sure I know what
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.400]  you're talking about. I did not know. I don't know what you are going to ask me. I didn't
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:02.720]  know. I technically I don't know. I don't know.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:17.080]  I don't know. That's right. And that is Sergeant Schultz, Ozzy Osbourne and the attorney general
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:26.800]  all telling you, I know nothing. Nothing. I tell you, it is really a crazy world. We
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.200]  are going back to our guest, who I hope can see us a little bit in the next hour and write
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:36.240]  shotgun and take phone calls today. Amazing talk show host. Whenever I'm out driving around
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.240]  on Saturday night or then on Sunday night, because they were here locally the next night,
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.920]  I love to listen to John B. Wells.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.320]  And he has a lot of courage, too, because I've been a guest on his show. He has a lot
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:55.160]  of other patriots on his broadcast, and it's just on over 500 affiliates. So he reaches
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.440]  probably every night, 5 million people, 6 million people when he does the Saturday show.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.100]  So it's just wonderful to have him there doing that.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:07.840]  Before I go any further, by the way, we put 80,000 of the magazine each month that we
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.640]  sell in bulk at cost at info.store.com. We put 80,000 as a test on the streets of San
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:19.440]  Antonio and Austin, and this sold out. The issue sold out in about five days. I don't
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.160]  know what was it, 30 something thousand we kept back to sell it bulk to get the word
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.560]  out because people really pay attention to a big glossy color magazine full of graphics
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:33.040]  and three free bumper stickers in it and so much more.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.580]  But it sold out. I mean, the last time we had something sell out that quick was magazines
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.280]  like into its 10th issue now. I guess we had one sell out in about two weeks. This sold
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:48.040]  out in less than a week. So we ran out and found a thousand or so that had just been
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.000]  put on the street and pulled those back off.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.600]  And then there was such a demand, I said just scour everywhere. So we sent out the crew
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.720]  and they were able to get a little more than a thousand again, but that is it. And it will
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:10.280]  be sold out very, very quickly, info.store.com. You can buy them individually or in bulk.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:15.920]  And it also supports the broadcast because we're selling these limited amount at an actual
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:21.120]  profit. Imagine that evil idea so we can try to print more magazines. And it's just something
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:28.080]  I believe in and going low tech while we dominate high tech as well. Another tentacle on the
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.440]  resistance against the globalist Hydra.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:36.440]  And if you wanna really support us financially, support our sponsors on info.wars.com and

[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.340]  I endorse it. Now there's ads on the network. I haven't been able to investigate that stuff.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.400]  Support some of it, don't support some of it cuz I don't know about it. But info.warshealth.com.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.280]  I believe in that and support it. Best stuff out there, info.warshealth.com. The propure
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:01.240]  gravity-fed water filtration, best out there, stainless steel spigot, blows away the competition

[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:10.460]  And we are the most hardcore in the face organization. We need to be financially strong. I'm trying
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:14.880]  to hire more journalists, more camera people, more editors, more researchers to do more.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:19.360]  I've got more than 100 unfinished projects I haven't even gotten out cuz I'm so busy.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.400]  So become a prisonplanet.tv member to see the daytime show, to hear the and see in high

[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:47.880]  the daytime show, info.wars.com forward slash show. And we were the biggest news story covering
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:55.600]  the Boston false flag, clearly a false flag, for over a week. The number one news system
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:59.320]  in the world when it came to that issue.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:03.680]  And it freaked them out. I mean, let me tell you, we're in danger. And I don't just say
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.640]  that, I mean, it's like watch your six. I mean, we got tie fighters on our butt. And
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.300]  you know what, I know that. I understand no matter what happens to us, I'm committed,
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:14.440]  I asked for all this.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.440]  It's just that we need your support. I mean, I can't imagine how anybody out there would
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.760]  not support prisonplanet.tv, would not become a member when you can share it with more than
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.720]  11 people. 11 people could simultaneously log in with the same username and passcode,
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.040]  but usually people aren't using it. I wish they would. So I say share it with 30, 40
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.040]  friends and family.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.840]  Give it to them as an e-card. Present it, hey, this is your free monthly subscription
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.280]  to prisonplanet.tv. Go see these films, see this live news show. That's how we reach more
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.320]  people. Tell people about the XM channel we're on. Tell people about the local AM and FM
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.500]  channel, like 1530 in Chicago, getting really good ratings after having us on for about
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.020]  less than a year.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:58.120]  Things like that, it's a big deal we're on the air. The system doesn't like this, it
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.960]  shows they're not in total control. So I don't spend a lot of time promoting sponsors and
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.160]  things. And I don't get much of the funding you hear on the network radio ads. Most of
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.640]  it's local or the network.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.160]  I need your support to continue to expand in the face of the New World Order. And I
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.600]  appreciate your support, we couldn't do it without you. And you support people like John
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:23.320]  B. Wells, who tell the truth. John, I'm ranting and I got a bunch of news obviously to cover.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.920]  Here it all is, IRS stalled conservatives groups getting 501c3 or others, but gave speedy
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.600]  approval to Obama foundations. Agency used planted questions to reveal scandal. Well,
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:38.740]  of course, I mean, in the Eastern Germany, the party members decided which women could
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.960]  be stars and demanded sex from all of them.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.440]  That's what having government run things is like. Absolutely not illegal is what the White
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.740]  House is now saying, the scum house. Is this still America? Charles Rangel outraged, wrong
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:58.280]  to abuse the tax system. In charge during Tea Party, targeting now runs IRS Obamacare
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.840]  office. Of course, they're gonna use your medical records and leak them to the press.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:02.840]  They've already done that.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  IRS henchwoman got $103,000 in bonuses for raking people over the coals. That's the kind
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:16.920]  of stuff up on DrudgeReport.com. Spying on the media, spying on the cloakroom. It just
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:23.000]  goes on and on, what's going on. And then meanwhile, military says no presidential authorization
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.320]  needed to quell civil disturbances. That is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb going off
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.320]  in DC.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.360]  I mean, it's bad enough to say NATO's in charge. Now the military is in charge themselves,
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.160]  but they say they follow orders from NATO. That's a narcotics trafficking, Bilderberg
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.400]  group, Nazi founded organization. That's what I'm saying, man. We're overrun and I'm ranting,
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.960]  you've got the floor.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:52.280]  Well, I wish I could rant like that. So I appreciate being able to do it by proxy, Alex.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:58.080]  It's absolutely unbelievable. And the thing is that, you know that thing about one bad
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.520]  apple can spoil the barrel?
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.520]  Yes.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:07.720]  That's really true. The strident liberals, I got an email every once in a while going,
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.000]  you're just a right winger. It's like, given the choice between the right wing and the
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.040]  left, I'm most assuredly a right winger. Heard McDermott today say in those hearings, as
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:23.600]  much as I don't like the right, the right wing. And I thought to myself, well, McDermott,
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.440]  you have traditionally been an idiot.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:32.280]  And I don't know how you remain in power. But I began to wonder, what is it about the
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:40.760]  right that you don't like exactly? They foment lies, that is their stock in trade. The Tea
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:50.200]  Party, that's a bunch of racists. I have seen no racism whatsoever. Nothing at any of those
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:54.240]  gatherings of the Tea Partiers, they wanna play it.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.920]  And all they have to do is just going back to dear old Uncle Adolf. All you have to do
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.760]  is continue to beat that drum. And some of these people, enough of them to make a difference
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:12.760]  are gonna go along with it. But yes, we have been hijacked by a criminal regime, end of
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.760]  story.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.760]  It's been visibly corrupt since the Kennedy assassination. But we're distracted, we're
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.560]  distracted with one war after another. What happened to North Korea? I put out over a
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.660]  coast to coast AM, I said, it's my source and it's a good one and I cannot name him.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.520]  You only have my word for it, but I've given it to you. There are things going on behind
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:36.040]  the scenes. You won't be hearing anything from, I'm paraphrasing here, you won't be
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.760]  hearing much out of Kim Jong-un in the very near future.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.200]  And what happened? He just drops right off the scope and he's gone. Not another word
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.280]  about it. One minute he's threatening Austin, LA and every place else, threatening Japan,
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.300]  all that. The next minute he's gone. Well, why is that? It's cuz China pulled the chain
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:02.200]  on his money. That's what this is all about. This is all about money. And these people
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:09.500]  are going to soak the citizens of this nation for everything they can, everything.
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:15.940]  They will disarm us if it comes down to it. They will pit the races against each other.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:20.560]  And the liberals will continue to push this ridiculous immigration reform. You know what
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:29.200]  my immigration reform is? Go home now, all illegal aliens must leave now, just like any
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:36.040]  other country. You can't just come here and just decide we like it here. They say 11 million,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.760]  I'm thinking more like 30 million.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.840]  We're gonna run across the border and have a baby. Now the baby's a citizen, he's an
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.960]  anchor baby, we're here. That's just wrong. Why are they doing that?
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.440]  Mexico doesn't let you do that. And again, the government's then there to try to make
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:54.920]  them clients of the government for the political takeover. And then they use it to create a
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:00.900]  national ID card for the citizens. Again, I mean, all these bills are piggybacked with
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:02.440]  a bunch of other garbage.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.400]  And notice they're trying to get everything passed right now. And the military talks about
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:14.120]  massive, widespread disturbances that are so bad for the first time in history, the
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:19.540]  president or the Congress may not be there to respond to it. During the Cold War, they
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:23.880]  didn't have this on the books. What do you think they're getting ready for?
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.640]  Well, I still think this economic collapse, going back to the money thing, I think the
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.360]  money is the trigger for everything. I was just looking at this thing called the traders
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:42.560]  wire. And the article is 10 scenes from the ongoing global economic collapse. 27% unemployment,
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:48.080]  60% youth unemployment in Greece, Detroit, Michigan is insolvent, rapidly running out
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:54.720]  of cash. Economic despair in France, 7,000 abandoned buildings in Dayton, Ohio, overwhelmed
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.060]  by squatters in Spain.
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:02.020]  The collapse of Chinese power consumption, horrible economic data coming out of the second
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:06.980]  largest economy on the planet, that would be China. One out of every five US households
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:12.320]  on food stamps, child hunger in America, the tremendous suffering of hundreds of millions
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.320]  of people, desperately poor people that we never even heard about.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:20.120]  Days are going bankrupt all over the country, not just Detroit. And then you'll have city
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.400]  managers paid $800,000.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:30.280]  Yes, Alex, I think what we should do is invoke that old radio bumper from back in the Stone
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:40.040]  Age, which is, tell your friends about info wars. Tell your friends to wake up, pull your
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:46.760]  friends into it. One person can pull, like you alluded to earlier, 10, 15 people, 10
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:49.720]  or 15 of their friends into it.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:54.060]  People thought that I was completely just looking for trouble, looking for some sort
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:59.280]  of a conspiracy somewhere. But over the last three years, there's a new little circle of
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:05.840]  friends that I developed. They're saying, what you said actually came to pass. I said,
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.140]  no, yes, and there's much more. Educate yourself, don't listen, don't repeat things like a parrot.
[01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:13.940]  Go to the net and go look for yourself.
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:18.920]  But you know, Alex, the thing that I find extraordinary is there is still some underlying
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.120]  credibility that mainstream media has. Now, I popped off last Saturday night and said
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:31.920]  that of the four major news outlets, excluding, I'm talking about the network people, I liked
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.480]  Fox the best because at least they'll talk about it. The other ones won't even talk about
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.700]  it.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:43.560]  And then when you look at Gates, Bill Gates, and his MSNBC, I'm sure that most people do
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:50.520]  not know that that means Microsoft NBC, and it does. Well, people don't believe it. You
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:56.000]  say that to them and they don't believe it. And they say things like, and you know this,
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.880]  that Alex Jones must work for the CIA because he's still walking around out there.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:06.560]  It's Alex Jones' visibility that keeps him safe. And I intend to keep you as visible
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.400]  as possible. And you can trust me on this, brother, unless they get me at the same time.
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:14.000]  If anything happens to you, you're gonna have a crew of some real serious cats trying to
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.400]  find out what happened to you.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:16.400]  So-
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.080]  Well, I appreciate it, brother. That feels good. That's why I try to hook up with other
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.880]  people like you. I try to promote other people over the years who try to fight the globalist
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.440]  because I know how real it is. You know how real it is. And yeah, that's what Jim Garrison
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.480]  said, of course, of JFK fame. He said, look, they said, why are you still alive and everybody
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.540]  else is dead?
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:41.000]  Because I'm visible. People think hiding and groveling gives them protection from mafias
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:47.640]  and gangs. It's the opposite. They go after the low lying cowardly fruit.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:52.520]  Well, that's true. And I read a very, very interesting article. I think it came from
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.540]  the UK Daily Mail. Now, this is not picking on people who don't eat their Wheaties, so
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:04.640]  to speak. But according to a study conducted by a British Scientific Institute, I'd get
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.160]  into it here, but I'll be doing the same thing Rubio did with his bottle of water.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:17.800]  It seems that their study revealed that physically strong men are more inclined to be on the
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:25.080]  right, while not physically strong men are inclined to be for the welfare state and for
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:30.520]  just a generally socialistic environment. Now, their study did not reveal any difference
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:37.080]  whatsoever in women who were either physically fit, physically strong women, or the more
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:42.300]  petite ones who don't work out all the time, except maybe just keep themselves toned.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:49.840]  As we consume these poisonous foods, and as we are encouraged to participate in behavior
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:58.640]  that is not really very good for us, I think we're developing more weakness generally.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:02.320]  And when you make people weak and you give them health problems, now, this is getting
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:07.800]  out of the fringe a little bit, but once you've contributed enough to the poor health condition
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:13.240]  of the population, they're gonna drift toward, please take care of me, I'm not strong enough
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.240]  to take care of myself.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:18.880]  I went to a rock and roll concert just to say I did last week, and I was appalled at
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.920]  my generation's physical condition. These people were so overweight and looked so unhealthy,
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.760]  I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Even the younger ones looked a little rough, but
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.760]  I mean-
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.200]  Well, I saw that study you were talking about, and in the rats that they feed GMO, even if
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:40.160]  they exercise them, they get fat, cuz the body's kinda putting it on as a defense mechanism.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:46.600]  And you're absolutely right, I mean, in animal husbandry, you feed aggressive species of
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.760]  domesticated animals certain diets that are known to make them more passive, and that's
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.760]  it.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.720]  Men and women that are statists are usually so cowardly, they really believe the state
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:03.320]  loves them and is their daddy. And see, that's their daddy and their perpetual children.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:08.560]  Well, the men are children of the state, the women are the ladies of the state, the state
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:14.320]  is their husband. And that's actually how the Romans 2,000 years ago in slave manuals
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:19.360]  that I've covered on air, described it. The women we marry to the state, and then the
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:26.120]  men will be perpetual children under the house slave that is the woman.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.160]  If they can get the women to do it, I'll tell you, I gave a little tribute to the mothers
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.360]  on Mother's Day, early Mother's Day morning, and mothers are proof positive that the women
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:40.840]  really are stronger. And what I find is that the women who send emails to me at the coast
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:48.720]  address are, they email me in greater numbers than the men do. There are a lot of support
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.720]  from the men out there.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:54.480]  Oh, no, no, exactly. I'm not demonizing women. I'm saying the women that are statists see
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:59.160]  this government as their husband, and the men are perpetual children. That's the globalist
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:01.960]  model, but I agree with you.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:06.200]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.600]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:16.000]  was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold to other countries,
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.920]  or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:25.760]  have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:32.720]  without even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance,
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:37.180]  the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:43.840]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:50.240]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or

[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:28.920]  Alright, I've got to apologize to callers, but you know, there's so much news to cover.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:33.040]  I want to go to Steve. I want to go to Casey, Yoat, Eric, Phil, everybody. We're going to
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:37.000]  get to you. You've been holding a while. After they leave us, other people can call in. We'll
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.440]  have John B. Wells with us riding shotgun for the whole next hour to cover news and
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:46.880]  take your calls. I want listeners to understand something, though, because I come at this
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.080]  what John was just talking about. From a position of being angry at somebody trying to make
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:54.480]  me and my family a slave. And when they're doing it to you, I take it personal. Because
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:59.400]  if it can happen to you, it can happen to me. It's called empathy, folks. I mean, I
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.280]  see something happen to somebody else's kids by the government or a group. I take it like
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:09.640]  it's my kid. Okay, and I know why people get callous and manipulative, because it's painful
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:11.640]  to sit there and really have empathy.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:17.480]  But you know what? You're alive when you do. And the so-called left are a bunch of authoritarians.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:21.360]  They're an authoritarian cult. The right is their placeholder. It works with them, but
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.040]  it's not really a real right wing. If you use that term pro-gun family, that's all talk
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:31.960]  too, to move the paradigm over. They're really authoritarians with a globalist technocratic
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.320]  agenda.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:42.560]  That's their own words. And they are hell-bent, hell-bent, hell-bent on radically transforming
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:49.000]  humanity into a system they control to reduce population. So this doesn't end at a good
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.360]  place. You're not breaking eggs to make a great utopian omelet. It always creates a
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:57.040]  nightmare because that's what they want to create.
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:00.800]  Jeffrey Dahmer created his own little heaven. It's a nightmare for you or I, a heaven for
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:07.960]  him. And I get up here and tell it like it is because the reality is hardcore. John B.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.280]  Wells, we're gonna go to break here, got a five-minute segment coming up, then a 12-minute
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:14.240]  segment, then a six-minute segment, then an 18-minute segment, then a five-minute segment.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.040]  But that's what's left in the broadcast today. But I want to start going to the calls when
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.160]  we start the next hour. And we'll go directly to them until we go through a couple boards
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:23.160]  of them.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:29.120]  But you've heard what I've laid out here. What else is on your radar screen? And I agree
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.860]  with you. I've noticed it's women that are the most charged up and aggressive against
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:37.920]  the New World Order who get it. So I wasn't scapegoating women as bad. And I know you
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:41.760]  weren't saying that. I want to clarify it. Hitler said, first you get the women, then
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:44.200]  you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.040]  As you know, 80% of advertising roughly in the West is targeted at women, cuz women make
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:54.420]  most of the decisions. And I mean, that's just that's the way it's been in every culture.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:57:00.480]  And so that's why women are targeted. That's why I bring up the women. Your comments on
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.480]  that?
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:08.000]  Yes, and I didn't mean to suggest however obliquely that you were doing that. So let
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.200]  me just make that perfectly clear. No, you were not doing that. And neither was I. What
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.840]  I'm saying is, ladies, here's the fact of the matter. You have more power than you think.
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:21.000]  I understand. I heard a guy say something one time. I'm gonna go ahead and blurt this
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.600]  out Alex, that he never heard such language coming out of people in his life, in his restaurant.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:33.120]  And I said, what do you think is doing this? And he eventually said, the attempted exploitation
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:36.440]  of women, which has been going on for a long time.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:44.680]  But he suggested that this was a gentleman's club mentality that these men are trying to
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:52.000]  impose on women in general. And making these, shall we say, exotic exhibitionists something
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.760]  to look up to, as if they have to conform to this algorithm.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:06.480]  What I would suggest is, women take charge of your men. I'm gonna go back to scripture
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:11.720]  for very briefly. A lot of women take exception to the, well, you really think that we should
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:21.200]  submit to our husbands? Bad interpretation. You submit an application. If I say, Alex,
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:27.000]  I would submit to you that Eric Holder needs to be thrown out of his office. Submit means
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.280]  to bring to, all that scripture means, my interpretation of it is that, you bring your
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.720]  problem to the old man, tell him what you need, including if he's messing up, which
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:37.720]  he is.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:51.600]  Absolutely. Stay there.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:57.200]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:01.800]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:12.800]  clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver,

[01:59:50.200 --> 02:00:07.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:16.720]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:28.440]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:32.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the third hour of this worldwide broadcast. I'm
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:39.240]  going to cover a ton of news with John B. Wells, syndicated radio host, with Coast2CoastAM.com.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:42.640]  And I appreciate everybody holding. Let's go through calls for about 30 minutes, then
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.760]  back into news and analysis with John B. Wells. He's going to be riding a shotgun with us.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.920]  This is a short little segment because for years, I didn't want to, stations didn't want
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:54.880]  to carry the news, so I do this five minutes, but it's a weird clock. We're going to be
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:00.080]  changing into the regular clock soon for everybody just so they know that. Steve in Florida,
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:06.360]  you're on the air. Welcome. Yeah, good afternoon, Alex and John. Alex,
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:10.880]  first of all, I called to talk about the corruption of the court system, but I just wanted to
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:16.760]  say first, I can so much relate to you. I've had people say, you know, oh, you're so fanatical.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.640]  I don't understand the intensity, and you're driven, and you know, it just seems like you're
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:28.400]  just so jealous for all this stuff. And it's just basically because the majority of people
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  I encounter, they are so asleep when it comes to what's going on, and they're in the matrix
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:39.360]  instead of being outside of it, and so they can't see the truth. And you know, I'm reminded
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.560]  that God says he'll send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie, and the reason
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.080]  is not because God wants people believing lies, but they chose that. It's like God had
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.520]  in Pharaoh's heart after Pharaoh. No, yeah, the Holy Spirit quits knocking
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.680]  on the door. It's like, okay, you consciously want this. But I mean, that's it. Look, being
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:01.040]  alive is intense. You know, if I'm at home eight o'clock at night hanging out with my
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:06.160]  wife, I'm relaxed watching a movie. But when I'm really focusing on this news and stuff,
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:10.760]  I would be giving into it, because I have those thoughts where I go, maybe it's just
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:14.600]  the way it's always been. It'll be all right. It'll work itself out, but it's not. It's
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.720]  getting worse. John B. Wells, you ever catch yourself trying to whitewash it yourself in
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:21.160]  your own mind?
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.160]  Whitewashing myself in my own mind? No, I've driven everybody crazy over the years who
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:30.760]  had the misfortune to be around me when I'm analyzing these things. No, no, I've been
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:36.400]  watching this for years and years. And one of the things that I'm really grateful for
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:43.080]  is that with about a 90% accuracy, I can remember little pieces of data that I just collect
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.200]  as time goes by so that later I've got a bunch of dots.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:51.360]  And I found that it's pretty easy to connect them because the big lie is right out in front.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.560]  Exactly, that's all Drudge does. The White House goes, the Drudge report's hurting us.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:00.880]  It only shows what they said a year ago, a month ago last week today, showing their liars.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:03.840]  They hate being called on it. They hate our memories.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:11.960]  Well, sure, I mean, even Rush Limbaugh, when the president says Rush Limbaugh is a problem,
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:17.480]  and there's a quote from him, not from Limbaugh, but from our president, our current president,
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.360]  that something to the effect of, well, I'm paraphrasing, the founding fathers have put
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:25.920]  a system in place that makes it just a little bit harder for me to affect change than I
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:26.920]  would like.
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:33.260]  It's like, what? And then the next thing at Ohio University, I really got some bad emails
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:38.880]  on this one. Good, good, send them. When I get a lot of flak, it's like that Obama pilot
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:42.560]  said, when you're getting a lot of flak, generally it means you're right over the target. Our
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.360]  president says, reject these voices that suggest that there's a conspiracy and that the government
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.120]  is tyrannical, and know that our great experiment will go forward. And we're really good people
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  up here.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.720]  I'm paraphrasing him heavily, but that was the message. And I said, wouldn't it have
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:01.920]  been better if he had said, if you think that there's any tyranny creeping up on you, absolutely.
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:04.240]  Investigate it, look at it, because we're not about that.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.720]  But I think that backfired. I agree, because FBI says, don't look at other photos of other
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:12.920]  bombers or other potential bombers. And then Obama's like, don't look at tyranny. Don't
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:18.440]  believe that could ever happen. I mean, that's 180 degrees, the opposite direction of common
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:19.440]  sense.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.600]  Well, it's the opposite direction of the founding fathers doctrine.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:29.600]  Yes, I mean, don't look at tyranny, trust the government. I mean, what? Don't run, we
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.960]  are your friends. It's like Mars attacks, and they're shooting, people stop and the
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:41.200]  aliens shoot them and then laugh. I mean, it might as well, I swear, if the media told
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:45.360]  the public to cement like aliens eating them, they'd probably spring their kids. The aliens
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.200]  are here to only eat one of your children. This people would line them up and go, I come
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:53.560]  in peace, eat my child. The aliens are like, thank you. I come in peace as well, bite into
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:54.560]  them.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:58.600]  We'll be right back with John B. Wells. Thanks, caller. Thanks, Steve. Casey, Yoat, Eric,

[02:07:54.100 --> 02:08:06.960]  your property 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Again, that's get simply safe calm.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:13.040]  He aligns himself with the truth. It's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:33.240]  to Alex Jones. Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. We're here live back Sundays
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:41.160]  4 to 6 p.m. with a Sunday show info wars nightly news seven o'clock Central Standard Time every
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:45.840]  weeknight. Again, thank you so much for joining us for taking phone calls right now in this
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:48.960]  open line third hour.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:52.320]  And then we're going to continue to get into some other reports haven't covered yet like
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:58.560]  robbers shove homeowner in closet where he kept his guns important article up on info
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:04.620]  wars.com. You can also see a promo video for some of the other gun shows I'm producing
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:09.360]  going to come out in June. I'm also going to be going to Bilderberg to cover that that
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.720]  should be extremely interesting.
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:16.560]  They're now announcing a free speech zone where protesters will be allowed to be in
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.440]  a field on the thousands of acres the grove owns inside the gate because they don't want
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.960]  you outside the gate where you can actually videotape the people. But they will have private
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.560]  security. They're doing TSA grope downs. No, thank you. I won't be going into their area.
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.560]  I'll be outside the gates.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:38.320]  They're videotaping the globalist coming in. But that's how they work it. Their ones. Oh,
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:42.360]  they're so gracious to do this. How wonderful. They're going to stick us out in a field where
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:47.400]  we can't see anything with private security treating us like we're criminals while globalist
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:49.040]  criminals meet in secret.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:52.800]  But remember, now it's in the British press. They're meeting and they're going to have
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:57.260]  the feds and the military and private security out there for a group that doesn't have any
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:02.220]  power and that didn't exist before. In fact, we're going to your calls right now. But John
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:08.360]  B. Wells, again, Coast to Coast AM talk show host Saturday nights. What do you make of
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:10.060]  the fact that global government didn't exist?
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:14.360]  Now they have to admit it and admit that it's authoritarian. The bullets didn't exist, but
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:19.040]  now they do. But we're still kooks thinking there's a nefarious reason. Or the armored
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:23.160]  tanks didn't exist for us, but now they do. And oh, the army manuals for FEMA camps didn't
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:27.900]  exist, but oh, now they do. But it's for a good reason. Or Bilderberg isn't real up until
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:33.620]  just five, six years ago. Now it's real, but we're bad to want to cover it.
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:38.500]  And yeah, Bill Gates is having a secret eugenics conference with world leaders this week as
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:42.620]  well. But the media doesn't need to cover that. Come on, kooks. You don't want to know
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:50.180]  what the guy that finances ABC News, NBC News, MSNBC, now they say underwritten on the stories
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:51.860]  by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:58.100]  I mean, what would we do without them, John B. Wells?
[02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:04.200]  They're treating us like we're stupid. And we are allowing them to continue to think
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:11.220]  that we're stupid because we do not insufficient numbers. Call their sponsors, email their
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:16.700]  sponsors, mail their sponsors and tell them, as long as you support this, we're not buying
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:23.180]  your stuff. It's like I like to say, Alex, if you want something to go away, quit buying
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:27.580]  it, whether it's a product, whether it's a program or whether it's an ideology.
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:31.500]  Vote with your feet, vote with your dollars. But that's one of the last big powers we have
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:36.740]  and we're using it. Now I want to ask you about that. CNN a year ago, its top show had
[02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:41.700]  a million viewers, now it's 400,000. They are in free fall, they're all in free fall.
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:47.100]  And Fox is getting smaller, but it's falling down fast, but miles above them, to quote
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:48.740]  Helter Skelter.
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:54.220]  So you've got all this happening while the real media is exploding. How are they gonna
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:56.740]  deal with that?
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:12:04.140]  They're not gonna deal with it. I really believe what is happening is that because of you and
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:11.020]  people who are in league together in preserving this constitutional republic, these morons
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:16.900]  keep talking about, it's a democracy. No, it's not. Democracy is mob rule. This is a
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:22.220]  constitutional republic. You're the tip of the spear, Alex, you really are.
[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:31.860]  And I'm just happy to be part of the shaft. But people are waking up and as they wake
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:38.580]  up and as they say, hey, isn't what you're doing illegal? Well, let's get a TV camera
[02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:42.660]  over here. Again, I go back to Fox. Fox News didn't give me any money to talk about them.
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:49.460]  I criticized a Fox reporter by name who walked past a woman who in fact had been shot during
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:53.440]  that when the cops wounded like nine people up in New York City over this one guy that
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:54.900]  came out.
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:13:00.300]  And she didn't see a bullet hole in the woman's body and did not see any blood running out
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.380]  of her, so she just walked past her. So I'm not in bed with Fox News at all. I just said
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:11.220]  that of the main news outlets, I prefer them vastly over the others. But the thing is,
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:17.580]  is that Fox News is the only one as far as television is concerned, mainstream television,
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:20.720]  that was even covering any of the Benghazi stuff.
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.820]  They're the ones that were running the hearings today that would stop for commercials. I don't
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:28.340]  know what they're doing now. I don't just take glue to the TV, thank God. But people
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:32.780]  are waking up and every time we say you're doing something that's illegal, inevitably
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.700]  the response is, well, I don't know, I didn't know anything about that.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.040]  I mean, they just let the guy go from the IRS who was gonna leave anyway at the end
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:46.380]  of June is the last thing that I heard on it. So it's falling apart, it's falling down
[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:54.220]  around their necks, and we have to keep the pressure up. Look at the furor that occurred
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:57.700]  over the gun grab that they attempted.
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:00.900]  These politicians figured out real quick, we're gonna get thrown out of office next
[02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:04.860]  year if we go along with this. Now, I'm not saying that all politicians are rotten. There
[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:10.020]  are a few of them up there that are good people and they believe in this constitutional republic.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:14.580]  But there are many others who are just gonna take what they can get, feather their own
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.900]  nest, and then to hell with the people.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:21.980]  The people are just useful idiots. All we need is their vote, that's all. We don't need
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:25.300]  anything else. There are a lot of them up there that are like that, they just want the
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:31.180]  power. But it's wearing thin. I believe, Alex, we're gonna win. I think we may get a little
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:34.620]  bit messy, we may even get a little bit bloody.
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:38.740]  But we're going to win. Look, we're all dead anyway. Everybody's gonna check out of this
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:40.380]  world at some time.
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:43.780]  Absolutely, it comes really quick. Doesn't it seem like five minutes ago that you were
[02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:45.060]  10 years old?
[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:49.820]  Absolutely, I remember my teen years like it was two weeks ago. But the thing is, don't
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:56.780]  you wanna stand for something while you're alive? I mean, we all went through the SDR&R
[02:14:56.780 --> 02:15:02.060]  thing back when we were encouraged to behave that way. Many of us have, I was a rock and
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.820]  roll jock in Dallas, Texas.
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:10.220]  And believe me, there was access to all sorts of things that are not good for you. But many
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:17.100]  of us have decided, if we hadn't had the encouragement and pretty much the license to behave as we
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:21.700]  did, don't think we would have done it. But people get drunk on what little bit of power
[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:23.580]  that they have.
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:27.820]  And power is good, say it's good to be king. Even if it's just a tiny little kingdom, it's
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:34.620]  better than being the stable boy. People are people, and they're going to do what is in
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:39.660]  their best interest first. It takes a little bit of reaching down into the soul and saying,
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:43.540]  I can do this, but should I?
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:48.420]  What mark is it gonna leave on me, on my character? What's gonna be written in the book up there
[02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:50.100]  in the sky, metaphorically speaking?
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:54.780]  Well, I use the gross analogy of a pool. Public pools have to have ten times the chlorine
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:59.740]  in it, and they're unswimmable, because everybody is peeing in it. And then I'll get up if I'm
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:03.940]  in a public pool somewhere on a trip or something and go to the restroom, I notice no one else
[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:04.940]  is doing it.
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:11.100]  I mean, why not start actually doing the other thing in the pool? And it's like when everybody
[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:15.040]  starts screwing everybody, and then other people think that's how you get ahead, then
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.220]  everybody starts doing it. The society becomes North Korea or Mexico.
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:28.980]  Well, yes, that's absolutely true. And to allow a cadre of anti, and when I say anti-American,
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:35.700]  what I mean is anti-constitutional republic. Anti, the only country that's ever existed
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:43.900]  in recorded history that had this kind of governance by the people of and for the people.
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:53.100]  Any cadre of people like this that are anti-American values is about like having a peeing section
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:54.560]  in the pool.
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:01.100]  That's right, or something else. It's even worse, it's like putting the sewage pipe directly
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:07.020]  from the bathroom into the pool. And then who's the IRS go after? Those that quote teach
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:11.020]  the Constitution. That was actually in the inspector generals that the thing was, are
[02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.060]  they talking about the Constitution?
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:17.580]  It's like police manuals, they make frequent references to the Constitution, put them in
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:23.600]  the terror database. Cops, you swore to that, you idiot. And I know most of the cops aren't
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:28.020]  idiots and know that, it's just we're in so much trouble, man. It's so obvious the bad
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:33.700]  guys are the ones that demonize the founding documents. I just, let's talk to Casey.
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:39.700]  Sure, old white guys, they call them. Who wants to listen to a bunch of old white guys?
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:41.180]  I mean, what is that?
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:45.020]  Okay, well, they said we should be able to own guns, property, have warrants to come
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:48.740]  in our house, a lot of good stuff. I don't care if they were old purple guys or green
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:49.740]  guys.
[02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:54.500]  Casey in Texas, you're on the air with a couple of old white guys. Go ahead, Casey.
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:18:01.420]  Alex, John, first of all, thanks for having me on. John just said something, and I was
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:06.580]  at a cross point about three weeks ago, something really important. Don't you want to stand
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:11.620]  for something while you're alive? I know you don't like to be thanked, Alex, I know that,
[02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:14.660]  but I do have to personally thank you, and I'll tell you why.
[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:19.060]  That Piers Morgan, when you were on that interview, and you said, if you try to take our guns
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:25.380]  away, the Republic will rise again. And that stuck out in my mind so much, it inspired
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:31.220]  me. I wrote a song, it's called The Republic is Gonna Rise Again, it's G-O-N-N-A. It's
[02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:37.620]  already out on iTunes, I made a YouTube video. But that song, it pretty much covers everything,
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:38.620]  the RFID chips.
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:42.820]  Well, yeah, and I told him, if you push too hard, you'll wake the slaves up, and then
[02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:46.900]  it's game over. And he had 2 million viewers that night, instead of, he had like 600,000
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:52.180]  at the time, now it's 400,000. He is hemorrhaging out, but they won't have me back on, because
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:54.420]  they said, we didn't like the message you put out.
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:58.900]  I knew it was gonna be big, I told my whole family. Of course, my dad's still asleep,
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:04.820]  he wouldn't listen, but I have a kid with autism, and that makes me mad enough. But
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:08.940]  by listening to that, it really inspired me to write, The Republic is Gonna Rise Again.
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:13.860]  I'll tell you exactly how they're gonna bring the RFID chip, and if I get killed for this,
[02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:18.700]  they can kill my body, but real Christians don't die, so my spirit will go to heaven.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:24.540]  But this is what they're gonna do, with all these celebrities you see coming out, that
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:25.540]  gun control and everything else-
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:28.740]  Oh yeah, the woman chops both her breasts off, all the other people run out to get it
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:31.380]  done immediately. They'll all come out and say it's the trendy thing to have a chip,
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:35.620]  that's what, Vera Chip said that 12 years ago, they were gonna use that, go ahead.
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:39.980]  Well, what they're gonna do, they're gonna use people that can influence public opinion,
[02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:43.500]  like Oprah Winfrey, and they're gonna get chipped, and they're gonna say, look, I got
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:46.420]  it, isn't it cool? You can get it too.
[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:48.860]  And I've already done that, they've already done that, they're already giving special
[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:53.380]  forces chips for at least five years. And again, I'm sad for women that get breast cancer,
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:58.180]  I've had it in my family, it's terrible, I hate it, they try to use the celebrities to
[02:19:58.180 --> 02:20:02.820]  say, turn your guns in. They've done that over and over and over again, but I'm glad
[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:10.580]  that you raised that, because Angelina Jolie was into hurting herself into darkness.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:16.100]  You can look this up into blood, into weird dark occultic stuff, very screwed up young
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:20.400]  lady. I don't think she consciously, cuz I don't think there's evidence of that, there's
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:24.580]  companies out there promoting everybody should get this gene test that's paid for with Obamacare
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:26.900]  for $4,000.
[02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:32.360]  That I agree with is a big scam, but to take both their breasts off cuz her mother died
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:38.480]  of this out of the fear. Why aren't we asking why is it exploding chemicals in the environment
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:44.300]  than triggering predisposition in genetics? We already had these genetics to have breast
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:48.420]  cancer, why is it up a couple thousand percent in the United States leading the world in
[02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:49.980]  the last 50 years?
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:55.420]  We know it's the bisphenol A, we know it's the GMO, it gives breast cancer to female
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:21:02.740]  rats, to female guinea pigs, we know why. But I mean, why wouldn't she come out and
[02:21:02.740 --> 02:21:06.960]  say, look at these studies on GMO, then we could get awareness and do it. That's why
[02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:11.860]  I hate her, is because she's so dark and ignorant, they can get her to go along with this.
[02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:17.900]  I don't think she's consciously involved cutting her breast, having her both double mastectomies,
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.140]  because she wants to go get money so that these globalists, they're just using her to
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:29.040]  be part of this as a useful idiot. But the point is, is that, what's next? Well, brain
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:32.020]  tumors are up, so we're gonna have everybody have their brains removed.
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:36.340]  Or let's have all girls when they hit puberty, they're talking about that, have their breasts
[02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:41.720]  removed. I mean, we're losing our humanity because they're doing it on purpose, then
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:49.140]  they hype the solution that is just a new Holocaust. One in 25,000, 30 years ago at
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:54.100]  autism, it's one in 50 something. Folks, they're killing us, John B. Wells, I appreciate your
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:55.100]  call, caller.
[02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:57.700]  John B. Wells, your take on that.
[02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:07.380]  On Angelina? Yes, sir. On the one hand, here's the thing, I understand how two good lawyers
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:13.260]  can go into a courtroom, one of them's gonna walk out the loser. I can understand how a
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:20.500]  case can be made for things depending on the mentality, and also the mentality of the judge.
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:25.580]  I think we know that Angelina Jolie is a little bit, she's a little bit out there on the edge.
[02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:29.380]  And there are some things about her that I admire. I mean, I admire the fact that she's
[02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:34.060]  a pilot, that she's had a good career. I understand she and her dad, John Voigt, are a little
[02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:38.100]  bit cross way, so probably ideologically, and that whole thing with Billy Bob Thornton
[02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:41.800]  and the little vials of blood that they used to wear around their necks and so forth.
[02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:46.100]  So I mean, I think she's a good artist, but I think she's a little bit of a freak. But
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:50.320]  unfortunately, it goes back to that, does life imitate art or does art imitate life?
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:59.820]  My answer is both. First art imitates life, and then life imitates art. And people are
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:05.540]  impressionable. Some people are gonna follow. I mean, look at that bunch out there in San
[02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:09.500]  Diego some years ago that decided to go ahead, we'll just all check ourselves out and catch
[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:13.980]  up to the UFO out there in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comment.
[02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:20.940]  Heaven's gate. I mean, the fact of the matter is that ignorance can be cured, but stupidity
[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:21.980]  is somewhat permanent.
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:28.580]  Sure, sure, my issue is there's never a discussion, why is autism exploding? And then, it's a
[02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:32.740]  conspiracy theory, it's the pesticides. It's a conspiracy theory, it's the vaccines. It's
[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:37.740]  a conspiracy, and I meant to ask the caller, every person I talk to, when did it happen?
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:41.360]  Why is it a boy? Cuz the boys don't have strong blood brain barriers like girls. Any doctor
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:46.160]  will tell you, a baby girl of any mammal species is stronger than a male, cuz women gotta be
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.640]  able to deal with infection, you name it.
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:53.820]  Women have a stronger blood brain barrier. Surgeons will tell you, women quit bleeding
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:59.820]  quicker. Women are tougher, women are better overall, that they're soft and sweet because
[02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:05.660]  they're nurturative. Men are there to compete with each other for the species and to defend
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:11.580]  women physically and to fight and to die to build a civilization, okay?
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:15.740]  And then women are humanity. They're the ones that create the children, the whole deal.
[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:20.780]  They have the mitochondrial DNA, they have more genetics than men do. And of course,
[02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:25.180]  men and women make the species, but the women, I'd say, are two-thirds of the species, and
[02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:26.620]  that's why it's under attack.
[02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:31.420]  And so let's not ask why our women are all getting breast cancer, why it's up 2,000,
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:38.180]  3,000%, why the US leads it worldwide. Let's just go chop the women's breast off. I mean,
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:46.460]  again, it's out of control. We need to say why is it happening? Why, why, why? Not sever
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:47.460]  your breast.
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:51.100]  You could just get some other cancer, folks.
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:57.020]  That's right, and Alex, this civilization of ours has been referred to repeatedly as
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:02.620]  our grand experiment. And I would submit to you and the audience that-
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:05.380]  Bad scientists are running it?
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:08.060]  Well, yes, to a degree, but-
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:09.060]  I'm sorry, grand experiment.
[02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:15.340]  No, no, I'm with you. That's really kind of where I was headed. The next experiment is
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:22.020]  to see what it will take to dismantle a free society. People aren't even aware that, and
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:25.620]  I don't want to offend any servicemen out there, but I went through the Vietnam era.
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:29.820]  I carried a 1A draft card. Sorry about that. They just never called me up. It's the only
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:32.900]  reason I didn't go. That's probably good that I did, and I'd probably still be in Lucy's
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:37.260]  Tiger Bar somewhere. Or Tiger Den.
[02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:41.700]  But the thing is, is we now have a mercenary army. And when I watch these commercials roll
[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:46.300]  over, I mean, let's just think about what we're seeing and how numbed our brains and
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:51.420]  our perceptions are becoming. If you look at, I mentioned them before, the Fox News
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:55.980]  outfit. I'm looking at that, and the next thing that I see is either a wounded warrior
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:26:00.340]  project, which of course our soldiers should be helped.
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:01.340]  Anybody should be helped.
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:05.420]  But they shouldn't be sent for five, six, seven tours and given deadly drugs. But then
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:07.900]  the answer is, feel sorry for them.
[02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:08.900]  Absolutely.
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:11.860]  That makes it okay. And I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:15.640]  Well, no, and then speaking of drugs, the next thing is that, did you take any of these
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:21.660]  drugs that, by the way, the FDA approved? Well, if you suffer death, dismemberment,
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:25.580]  injury or otherwise, you may be entitled to money damages. Here, call this law firm. We
[02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:28.500]  specialize in this stuff every day.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:34.340]  And then, this medication has minimum sexual side effects while it controls my depression.
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:40.180]  And here's something else. And you listen to all these diseases that you may be liable
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:44.580]  to contract if you take this drug. And by the end of the commercial, you're asking yourself,
[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:52.300]  why would I take such a thing from beautiful toenails to, I've got COPD to pick something,
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:54.820]  some ailment, real or imaginary.
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:27:00.360]  There's a drug for it. And the next thing you see is, it's a bad drug, call this attorney.
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:08.260]  This experiment is turning somewhat nasty. I do believe that we will win. I really do.
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:12.840]  But we're gonna have to wake up the army. People are gonna have to, you can't just get
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:17.940]  mad in spurts. There are a lot of screens up, I understand this. There are a lot of
[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:25.060]  issues to deal with. IRS, gun control, immigration, and let's see, what are you feeding us?
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:30.060]  Why does the state make people put fluoride back in their water after the municipalities
[02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:38.020]  decided we're getting rid of it? UCLA released a study three or four months ago that said,
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:44.140]  fluoride in water retards the mental development of children, period, end of story, it does.
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:51.500]  Well, it's still in there. So we have to rise up. We simply have to rise up. We have to
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:54.980]  do something. Your government is not your friend.
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:28:00.220]  And that's the thing. The public's already so mentally deficient now from 60 years of
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:05.380]  hydrofluorosolic acid fluoride that they can't even get upset. And if you go to the city
[02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:12.820]  council with Harvard scientists, the mayor laughs and they all will turn their chairs
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:15.420]  around and giggle.
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:19.560]  And I mean, these guys, grandkids are all getting their pineal gland shot. But it's
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:24.180]  like they think laughing about it will keep them safe. So the banks are like, we'll take
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:29.060]  their pension funds, they're gonna laugh at that too. Hey, they said NATO can be the command
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:30.060]  of the military now?
[02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:32.140]  How about just say the military is now in command?
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:39.060]  Yeah, how about that? I mean, it's all just like, I've been there. And I've seen the videos
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:45.980]  when we fly in Harvard scientist and you name it, and it's in the New York Times having
[02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:48.420]  to admit, okay, 20 something studies.
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:54.500]  It doubles this cancer sevenfold, the bone cancer, brain damage, destroys the sperm,
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:29:00.220]  blah, blah, blah, diabetes, blah, blah. And then I go to the city council, here is the
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:05.700]  scientist who just gives us and the city council goes, we're gonna be in our chambers, you
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:09.740]  go ahead and have your citizens communication.
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:15.740]  And the mayor laughs and you're like, I mean.
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:24.660]  Well, men like you, myself, who talk about these things, put our faces out there for
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:31.940]  everybody to see, use our real names for everybody to know. All we can do, Alex, is be the coaches.
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:36.800]  We're gonna be the ones who get fired if the team doesn't win. But in the end, it's the
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:41.980]  team members, it's their fight. It's all of our fight, but it's the team members out there,
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:43.460]  they're the ones that have to do it.
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.620]  We can talk about this stuff, we can research this stuff, we can bring the information to
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:51.340]  people. But if they don't wanna listen and they don't wanna react to it, it's pretty
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:52.340]  much out of-
[02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:54.780]  More fires on the run. More calls coming up.

[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:06.380]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:11.660]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:15.940]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight
[02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:21.180]  out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:25.920]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,

[02:33:04.660 --> 02:33:10.300]  the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the
[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:23.600]  Alex Jones show. Alright, I've got some financial news I want to hit. I want to play a piece
[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:29.340]  of a newscast where robbers shove homeowner in closet where he kept his guns. Yeah, you
[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:34.220]  don't want to shove me in my closet. Get in there. Get in the closet. Oh, really? In this
[02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:39.300]  closet right here where I've got like eight handguns and a shotgun. Okay, let me this
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:43.940]  is terrible that you've locked me up in here and then he shot him. And the media, the newscast
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:47.980]  is police are not going to be charging the homeowner. Always that implication. You know,
[02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:53.340]  if you stab somebody in your own home who's raping you, you can pull up the BBC articles,
[02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:59.820]  BBC articles. They then indict you. Well, you've heard the stories here where the robber
[02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:06.620]  falls to the skylight, sues and wins. You need to have robbers safe skylights up there
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:09.940]  so that they don't fall through and break their leg.
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:15.340]  And it's because criminals now run the system at many levels. And they want to be protected.
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:19.700]  It's like they've gotten rid of all the IRS enforcers on billionaires and people. That's
[02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:23.220]  why they're allowed to be tax exempt because it's all selectively enforced. But you make
[02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:28.240]  $200,000 a year, they're gonna rake you over the coals. There's no way they've written
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:33.020]  the tax code. That's in the news today where it's impossible.
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:37.780]  It's impossible to ever pay it where they can't later claim you did something wrong
[02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:44.780]  and give you penalties and interest. It's the whole thing. I was talking to a police
[02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:50.020]  detective the other day and he said, look here in Austin, he said, look. He goes, we're
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:54.220]  not allowed to go after the motorcycle gangs, the particular ones he was naming because
[02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:56.060]  the government lets them run the drugs.
[02:34:56.060 --> 02:35:01.580]  The argument is so the worst Mexican drug cartels that are even more ruthless don't
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:05.620]  control it. That's what Brzezinski writes about in a couple of his books I read. Yes,
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:10.060]  we control the criminal networks because then we can control it and not let it get too out
[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:16.580]  of hand. I mean, that's always the excuse. We grow the opium so the Taliban doesn't get
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:17.580]  it.
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:23.860]  And then they increase it 10 times the production at least. Look that up. 93% of world opium
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:31.100]  production since the US liberated Afghanistan from like 9% of world production. And he's
[02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:33.900]  sitting there telling me this and I already knew all this, but I mean, I've talked to
[02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:35.460]  L.A.P. detectives.
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:42.540]  I even have been in events several times that had like the real, you hear about the legendary
[02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:45.820]  Vikings, the police gang out in L.A. Let me tell you, you're hanging around with the biggest
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:49.380]  Hollywood stars. That's who's around, folks. That's why those Hollywood stars are basically
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:55.580]  above the law because it's all gangsterism. And the thing is, they're not naive. Then
[02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:59.020]  they're like, well, I don't like what we do, but you know, if we didn't do it, somebody
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:00.020]  else would.
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:03.300]  It's like that argument. But then once you give into that, the sky's the limit. I'm going
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:07.460]  back to calls with Yoat, Eric, Phil and others. But what's your take on what I was just saying
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:12.500]  there? Because there's this argument of you guard the good by being more evil than the
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:16.540]  evil. Well, when you dance with the devil, he doesn't change, you change.
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:23.940]  Well, as long as you're going to mention the devil, the devil is the master deceiver. So
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:26.940]  of course, they've got to have some argument that goes back to what I mentioned earlier
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:32.300]  about two lawyers go in and one of them walks out the loser. They're both equally qualified.
[02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:36.940]  I think the best way to address that, Alex, is just to say that I got some flak over this,
[02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:40.580]  which, of course, I'm delighted when I get flak from the left wing, because that means
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:42.420]  I tweaked him up, raised their blood pressure.
[02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:50.060]  And I like doing that. A quote from Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged when she was talking to
[02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:55.380]  one of the characters. There's a dialogue in the story. And the man said, you're not
[02:36:55.380 --> 02:37:00.500]  up against a bunch of boy scouts up here. We want power and we're going to get it. What's
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:06.820]  in it to have a law abiding society? Nothing. A government can't control innocent men. So
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:13.780]  what you do is you continue to concoct laws and make everyone guilty of something.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:18.900]  Because the only thing that the state can do is come down and crush the criminal.
[02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:23.100]  And then they leave escape hatches for themselves and they're exempt.
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:27.720]  Always, always. I think that some of these people up in Washington right now, names that
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:31.860]  we both know, I think they need to go to jail. I think they need their assets sealed. And
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:37.740]  I would just take this opportunity to say, people, take your power back. If you want
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:41.980]  to bring this nonsense to a halt, defund it.
[02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:47.000]  They can't do anything without money. You have a mercenary army now. I don't give a
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.580]  damn what anybody thinks about that. It's a fact. Did you see Jack Reacher? We used
[02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:56.820]  to read the great books and so forth, and we still do. But some of the script writers
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:57.820]  are very, very good.
[02:37:57.820 --> 02:38:02.020]  No, I saw Reacher. That was a good movie. You remember what he said when he's talking
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:04.620]  about the sniper? And he said, some people join the army because they want to serve.
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:09.060]  Some of them kind of have to do it. They need a job. But some of them do it as a legal means
[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:15.580]  of killing people. And so I would submit to you that there is a measurable percentage
[02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:20.100]  of persons in the force department.
[02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:24.740]  The first time they stopped calling them peace officers and stopped talking about law and
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:28.620]  order and it became law enforcement, that was the first flag that was read.
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.180]  And the police force.
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.740]  Yes, the police force, not the police department, the police force. All you have to do to take
[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:40.140]  the wind out of these sails is defund it.
[02:38:40.140 --> 02:38:43.460]  But they stage things or let things happen so they get more funding and then they kick
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:48.100]  the good people out. Because there are people that join because of family history, there
[02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:51.100]  are people that join because of an instinct to serve and defend like Pat Tillman.
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:54.580]  There are people that join because they need the money. People that join because they want
[02:38:54.580 --> 02:39:00.500]  to be psychopaths and kill people. But there's also people like I have family that I knew
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:04.420]  20 years ago when they joined the army were one person because I'd go hunting and fishing
[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:05.420]  with them.
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:11.980]  And after, it's not even now, it's like Hurt Locker. They have been in so much combat, seen
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:17.100]  so many things, they're not awake till they get in a firefight. They're not awake till
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:21.340]  they come out of helicopters all over the world. They're not awake till they're in a
[02:39:21.340 --> 02:39:22.860]  knife fight with somebody.
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:26.300]  They're not awake till they're stripping down an engine and fixing it real fast. They're
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:30.340]  not awake till they go climbing up a mountain. They're not awake till they get in a barroom
[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:34.260]  fight. They're not awake till they, and the big thing is it's not even that they want,
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:38.080]  it's just they want, they want to kill.
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.780]  But it's not just in a psychopathic way. They want to be being shot back at as well. So
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:47.540]  that group I can even halfway respect, but they're creatures of long term, really post
[02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:51.540]  traumatic stress disorder. But instead of collapsing in it, they thrive in it. You know
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:52.540]  what I'm talking about?
[02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:58.200]  Absolutely, I do. And you had a story. I think you were the first one with the story on Info
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:05.140]  Wars about the classification that Janet Napolitano has put on returning vets. So it's just like
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:09.420]  going back to scripture. That's what the devil does. If he can't get you a drug overdose
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:15.340]  and kill you, he'll settle for five years a hard time for intent to distribute.
[02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:20.660]  The evil dark force will use you on, they'll pin metals on you and they'll pat you on the
[02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:25.740]  back and tell you, great job, son. Great job, gal. And then as soon as your usefulness is
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:29.780]  spent, they'll just throw you under the bus, just bump you off. You're done, next. That's
[02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:34.420]  what's going on now with these health issues. They don't want us living into our 80s and
[02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:38.740]  90s or any of that. They want to attract about 30 years of productivity.
[02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:44.560]  I've had the scientists on. They inject the troops on record with experimental vaccines
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:50.620]  that have virus plaques that embed in the cells that are designed to trigger when hormone
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:55.580]  levels go down. And then you get cancer 55, 60 when they're done with you. I mean, we're
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:40:59.020]  all being given time delayed death bombs basically.
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:05.460]  Alex, if this thing is allowed to go as far as it could go, what you will have is in the
[02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:08.820]  same way that I said one of these days, you're gonna be looking, I understand Japan's already
[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:10.300]  done it actually.
[02:41:10.300 --> 02:41:13.820]  You'll be looking at a news anchor that you think is a real person and it's not. It's
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:15.940]  a beautifully done computer.
[02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:19.820]  They've already announced that. The president didn't just have robo signers. They're saying
[02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:25.220]  next year they may, they've already got it built, a 3D projection of Obama that they
[02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:29.780]  just typed the words in and then he can appear anywhere to school kids, whatever, and they'll
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:31.860]  kind of think they saw Obama.
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:36.140]  Well, some of these visionaries like Lucas and the Star Wars thing, there very well may
[02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:43.100]  be a war of the Clone Wars. Once they decide, we only want these people. We don't want that
[02:41:43.100 --> 02:41:46.100]  body type. We don't want this body type. We don't want that appearance. We don't want
[02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:51.580]  that hair color. They can do that. Do you know that this thing that was science fiction
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:56.800]  maybe ten years ago, which of course that means it's been investigated and experimented
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:59.380]  with for years.
[02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:05.500]  Now they're actually able to target races with fatal diseases.
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:10.460]  Race specific bio weapons, yeah. Expanding, they came out yesterday and went, we can now
[02:42:10.460 --> 02:42:15.460]  clone. And then you read the fine print because I remember reading it 16 years ago. 16 years
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:21.300]  ago when BBC first admitted in London, they admitted clones of humans, but they go, it's
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:26.780]  okay. We don't bring them to term. And now they go, well, we bring them to term, but
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:31.500]  that's classify what we do, but they're part animal, so they don't have rights.
[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:37.020]  So the shampoo says no bunny rabbits were tested on. You're like, good, good. But then
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:41.620]  you understand there are humanoid creatures they brought to term. This is in the literature.
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:47.060]  But the news only, this is getting into regular coast to coast AM type stuff, but that's not
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:52.860]  speculation in the medical literature. And now they're going, these new clones can be
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:57.740]  brought to term and they're telling us about 25, 30 year old stuff, my friend.
[02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:02.340]  Let me tell you, you go back to Anthony Burgess and you go back to the guy who wrote Clockwork
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:06.420]  Orange and another book he wrote called The Wanting Seed and all of these visionaries,
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:13.940]  Bradbury and Asimov and Heinlein. This is going to happen. I could imagine a futuristic
[02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:21.220]  a la science fiction, a scenario where you have the power elite who remain at the peak
[02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:22.460]  of their physical development.
[02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:24.500]  Yeah, no, that's it.
[02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:27.100]  And then they rotate the clones through, they got a life expectancy.
[02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:32.580]  No, no, no, they say you're gonna have to have money to be able to go and just live
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:37.580]  because again, you're gonna have to pay for the genetic treatment so your breasts don't
[02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:39.140]  have to be cut off.
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:46.260]  Well, sure, and we can either wait and just kind of watch this unfold as William Wallace
[02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:53.700]  said in the picture again. You'll live for a while and just watch this unfold or we can
[02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:59.180]  decide what are the pillars of civilization. Go back to the ancient philosophers who were
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:05.560]  trying to write down in permanence what makes a good life and cling to that.
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:09.460]  Or let these idiots have their way, these evil, stupid people.
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:17.540]  Who, by the way, like you said, their fruits are rivers of rotting scrofulous. I mean,
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:20.380]  rivers of stinking failure.
[02:44:20.380 --> 02:44:29.160]  Yes, endless failures. The society is getting worse and worse and yet in the great balance
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:35.420]  of things, I really believe the people are waking up. And those who will not wake up,
[02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:39.380]  we're not going to be able to wake them up. They will oppose you, they will oppose me,
[02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:42.940]  they will oppose anything that constitutes any sort of moral character.
[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:46.820]  Because they lust after degeneracy, they get off on it. They're saying it's gonna be a
[02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:52.220]  wonderful future. Yote in Kansas, you're on the air, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:59.580]  Awesome, I'm glad to talk to you. Okay, the phone is acting funny. So much you guys are
[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:04.500]  talking about, you are the tip of the spear. The other day you said you're the preacher,
[02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:07.660]  you should be the chief, you should be there in skin.
[02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:12.820]  The contest is awesome, they probably wanna tear your guts out like William Wallace. I
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:20.100]  recently had a little baby girl and my wife's mother is super strong. Just like the strong
[02:45:20.100 --> 02:45:27.580]  woman you're talking about, really intelligent and would never say that she is. We opted
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:31.300]  out not to vaccinate, the next day the doctor came out and said, oh, I saw that you're not
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:35.820]  gonna vaccinate your baby, you know she could be a threat to society. And he just wanted
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:39.180]  to engage me and my wife was like, oh, you shouldn't have engaged him, he just wants
[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:45.860]  to show you that you're smarter. My father never, he's of the same age of the gentleman
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:50.460]  that's on there today. He was a coast to coast listener, he's not here anymore.
[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:55.060]  He loved all those writers he was just talking about. And he always told me and my brother,
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:58.780]  do not be in the military, don't be part of it. My brother was accepted to the Air Force
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:06.240]  Academy, he hated it. And we're with you, don't talk about leaving, talk with power,
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:08.340]  you gotta fight, you're the-
[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:14.380]  No, I just get depressed by watching them hurt innocent people. And again, my empathy
[02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:20.940]  is my strength, it's your strength. But it just, it hurts because it's so obvious now.
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:25.260]  And how much more obvious, when I got up this morning and Watson said, have you seen this?
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:28.820]  And I went and looked at it and looked at the documents. And I went, my God, they're
[02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:32.420]  gonna say the military is now outside even the president?
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:37.780]  I mean, that even shocked me, it's so over the top and that it's moving this quick. And
[02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:43.540]  it's really kind of a nostalgia for freedom and then realizing things are only gonna get
[02:46:43.540 --> 02:46:49.420]  worse before they get better. It's just wishing this didn't have to happen. It's kind of like
[02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:54.060]  that feeling where the light turns green, you drive out, this happened to me once and
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:57.980]  you look over and some idiot ran the red light going 50 miles an hour.
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:03.300]  And it's like only two seconds, but it seems like five minutes. And you think, man, I wish
[02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:07.860]  I'd have looked, I wish that idiot wouldn't have run that red light. And then you start
[02:47:07.860 --> 02:47:12.820]  gripping the steering wheel and gripping your teeth going, man, I can't believe people.
[02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:17.980]  It's like a big long thought goes on about, man, why didn't I do it? Why are they, look
[02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:24.040]  at them, my God, they're talking on their phone or my gosh, there's kids in the back
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:25.040]  seat.
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:30.960]  I hope they don't get hurt. Man, this is just, I wish this wasn't gonna happen. Boom, I mean,
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:35.460]  and that is exactly what it's like. I'm just sitting there going, this is really, and so
[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:40.020]  many other cars have hit us that weren't as big. Now bigger and bigger ones are smashing
[02:47:40.020 --> 02:47:43.860]  into us. And I'm like, when do we get off this merry-go-round? When do people get out
[02:47:43.860 --> 02:47:44.860]  of their trance?
[02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:48.380]  Because the thing is, as it gets worse and worse, more people are only gonna give into
[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:52.860]  it more. Like you're gonna have a splitting. Those of us that get more awake and people
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:54.900]  that just will buy anything, John.
[02:47:54.900 --> 02:48:00.380]  Yes, they will. And the reason that I brought up the mercenary army part is that I don't
[02:48:00.380 --> 02:48:03.540]  want anybody to get, there are some fine law enforcement people out there. I know some
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:06.380]  of them and I like them. There are some nice, excellent people.
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:08.620]  But evil is in control of the system.
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:14.300]  Well, I don't think anyone should be under any illusions that the police and the military
[02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:17.660]  won't fire on citizens. They will, they've done it before. Look what happened in Boston.
[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:22.380]  Oh, did you see the part about the Marx a lot message inside the cabin of the boat?
[02:48:22.380 --> 02:48:23.380]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:29.020]  I mean, how ludicrous is this? It reminds me of that so-called suicide note that Vince
[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:31.820]  Foster left behind after his.
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:37.420]  And then they say, he confessed while in the hospital drug, it must be true. They can blow
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:39.820]  something up and grab me and say that.
[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:42.900]  I thought that was deplorable the way those people were treated. These guys run out with
[02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:47.680]  their hands over their heads on their boxer shorts. I had to abandon their sweet or salty
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:51.420]  snacks in front of the TV. These guys are pointing machine guns at him. A guy tries
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:57.260]  to put his hands down, another guy yells at him while he's pointing this M4 at him.
[02:48:57.260 --> 02:49:02.740]  That makes my blood boil. And I'll tell you something, I have been tempted to leave this
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:07.900]  country and not come back. But I'll tell you what, these SOBs aren't gonna make me leave
[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:09.540]  my country. I'm staying.
[02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:14.100]  God bless you, absolutely. There's nowhere to run anyways. If it keeps getting worse,
[02:49:14.100 --> 02:49:18.260]  I'm gonna get my family out of here though. Eric, Eric in North Carolina, you're on the
[02:49:18.260 --> 02:49:19.260]  air, welcome.
[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:21.180]  Hey, Alex, how's it going, buddy?
[02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:23.580]  Good, go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:28.540]  I think your guest is right in that this is all gonna start with the money. And that brings
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:34.060]  me to my next prediction. I think the next Federal Reserve Chairman is gonna be an African-American
[02:49:34.060 --> 02:49:39.980]  financier by the name of Roger Ferguson. This will be effective because when the Federal
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:46.060]  Reserve sells all of its treasury bonds and other stuff that it's bought with newly printed
[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:51.700]  money, that's gonna create a mass amount of destabilization, volatility. And it's gonna
[02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:58.620]  be effective to have an African-American financier right there as the Federal Reserve.
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:50:01.580]  Then they can say it's racist if you don't like them taking your bank account.
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:09.020]  Exactly, it'll keep at bay the angst and the anger that will be foisted on that institution.
[02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:15.020]  Well, he is Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and
[02:50:15.020 --> 02:50:20.780]  is currently the President of the Chief Executive of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.
[02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:24.740]  We'll see, did you get a tip on this, or why do you think that?
[02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:30.100]  It's the media. I see the media grooming him through interviews that I see on CNBC. And
[02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:35.340]  the way they end their interview with him, the anchors are like, he didn't say he wouldn't,
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:40.900]  he didn't say he wouldn't be the Federal Reserve Chairman. So I see them pre-programming us
[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:43.340]  in a way that will expect that he might be.
[02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:48.020]  And then the racists don't like it cuz they can go, a black guy did it. Bernanke was doing
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:53.460]  a good job till that black guy got in there. It was like the Federal Reserve's been running
[02:50:53.460 --> 02:50:57.500]  us for 100 years, shedding all this shop. I think you're probably right. If they're
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:01.540]  on the news saying he's a good guy, I'll tell you I like Ferguson.

[02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:11.400]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:15.680]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:21.140]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[02:52:21.140 --> 02:52:25.580]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:36.300]  cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:40.460]  chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that

[02:52:58.780 --> 02:53:03.200]  It's the only one you've got. Hi, my name is Stephen Heuer. As a degreed nutritionist,
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:07.340]  my first priority is for you to get healthy. That won't happen if I make wrong recommendations
[02:53:07.340 --> 02:53:11.300]  or cause you to spend money on supplements you don't need. After 20 years working with
[02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:15.700]  thousands of products and thousands of people, I know for the most part what does and does
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:20.860]  not work. One World Way is the first and only unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed
[02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:26.100]  cows on the market. It retains substances that no other whey protein powder has. These
[02:53:26.100 --> 02:53:30.860]  nutritive compounds supply life-giving nutrition. Your body merely needs the right conditions
[02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:35.860]  to make great health happen. Due to low quality foods, toxicity and aging, having great health
[02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:40.780]  is more of an effort than ever. One World Whey is the superfood of the century and when
[02:53:40.780 --> 02:53:46.860]  added to your diet, it promotes energy, detoxification, muscle gains, fat loss and overall radiant
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:57.420]  health. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com. That's OneWorld
[02:53:57.420 --> 02:54:26.980]  Whey.com.
[02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:36.900]  Yeah sometimes Satan. Comes as a man of peace. Alright I'm going to go back to your phone
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:43.540]  calls right now. A little bit of overdrive. Mr. Wells is going to leave us here in a moment
[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:47.540]  but I'll get to all the callers at least that are on the board. Tonight we're going to premiere
[02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:52.220]  that man on the street with Jakari Jackson where he went out and talked to 30 people,
[02:54:52.220 --> 02:54:59.020]  20 of them wouldn't talk to him, 10 talked to him, 4 of the 10, 40% that talked to him
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:02.980]  in 15 minutes. We don't just go out and do this all day to find what we want. We go out
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:07.300]  for 15 minutes and that's what happens. 4 of the 10 people said they want to kill children
[02:55:07.300 --> 02:55:11.300]  up to age 3 because it's women's choice. That's going to air tonight and it just shows how
[02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:16.460]  whacked out things are. You've heard 9 out of 10 in Austin say ban water for the earth
[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:22.140]  if Al Gore says so. You've heard him say confiscate all gun owners guns, put us in labor camps.
[02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:28.100]  I didn't get to the robbers shove homeowner in closet where he kept his guns. That video
[02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:33.820]  is up on info wars.com. Pretty powerful pro-gun stuff there. Sunday is going to be clip central
[02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:41.420]  4 to 6 p.m. In studio next Monday, Joel Skousen is going to be here. We're going to have next
[02:55:41.420 --> 02:55:47.040]  week the big interview with Mike Judge where he got political because the hour is running
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:52.780]  out here. The time is short. So just a lot of surprises coming up on the nightly news
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:57.540]  and everywhere else. If you're not a prisonplanet.tv subscriber, it's 15 cents a day and you get
[02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:03.580]  11 memberships a month for that. It's like 55 cents a person per month. This is because
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:08.380]  one membership is really 11. Prisonplanet.tv. Again, I want to thank John B. Wells for spending
[02:56:08.380 --> 02:56:12.540]  so much time with us today. Let's take another call here. Phil in Texas who's been holding
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:19.940]  a long march. Thank you, Phil. You're on the air. Welcome. Hey, Alex and John. A huge fan
[02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:29.100]  of you guys. Just wanted to talk about the open carry march on July 4th. I just I'm really
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:35.260]  concerned about it just because so much on the line and I feel like it's maybe not being
[02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:40.640]  gone about in the best way. Just because at this point you kind of have to expect the
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:46.260]  provocateur or the bomb or, you know what I mean? Just and here's the deal. I've never
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:50.460]  done an armed march on Washington, but the Supreme Court ruled five years ago that it's
[02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:53.840]  unconstitutional for them to prohibit the Second Amendment there, but they're still
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:57:01.380]  doing it. So I admire Adam Kokesh for his courage. I have said that I would just have
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:05.540]  a camera if I was there. But then he's like, well, thank you for endorsing it. No, that's
[02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:09.500]  not what I'm doing. I'm not endorsing it. And I hear what you're saying, but I'm not
[02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:14.780]  going to demonize him and sit there and snipe is my point. And we can't, you know, well,
[02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:19.620]  we better not go out and protest. They might provocateur us there, you know, and a right
[02:57:19.620 --> 02:57:21.580]  not exercise is a right that's lost.
[02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:28.860]  So I have mixed feelings about it. John B. Wells, what do you think?
[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:36.340]  What I think is this? I don't know. I don't know how to answer that one. I don't understand
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:43.620]  the all of these contradictions. This has taken a long time to get to this point. Let
[02:57:43.620 --> 02:57:50.180]  me just submit this to you, Alex, and to the listeners. This is a short paragraph.
[02:57:50.180 --> 02:57:55.860]  The worth of a people, the character of its internal organization, which through this
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:58:01.740]  worth of a people may produce its effect, and the character of a people's education,
[02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:06.540]  these are the starting points for political action. These are the foundations for the
[02:58:06.540 --> 02:58:11.740]  success of that action. When you consider we were just talking earlier about how fast
[02:58:11.740 --> 02:58:18.300]  the time is going by and how it seems like two weeks ago we were in our teens.
[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:25.180]  The game is is well underway and we're way behind. Now, the people who are in power now
[02:58:25.180 --> 02:58:30.980]  do not care about the Constitution. They violate it whenever it suits them. And then when they're
[02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:33.500]  called to account, they say they don't know anything.
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:36.580]  And laying down to them only encourages them. Stay there. I want you to be able to finish
[02:58:36.580 --> 02:58:39.100]  this point and let you get out of here. Callers, stay there.
[02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:52.100]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[03:00:22.660 --> 03:00:27.620]  All right, John B. Wells is our guest. It's our final segment. I'll try to get to some
[03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:36.140]  calls here. It's just time runs out so quickly. Yeah, I see one of the callers wants to talk
[03:00:36.140 --> 03:00:41.220]  about solutions. The solution is stop complying with tyranny. Enforce against it. Get angry
[03:00:41.220 --> 03:00:45.360]  at it. Cops walk over and say you can't film in public. Say it's America, First Amendment,
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:49.180]  you film us. Stop acting like slaves or you'll become them.
[03:00:49.180 --> 03:00:51.940]  But you were getting the point about that quote and the break cut you off about the
[03:00:51.940 --> 03:00:57.660]  Constitution and the establishment doesn't care about our Constitution, John B. Wells.
[03:00:57.660 --> 03:01:03.960]  Yes, that quote that I read is from the book My New Order. That was Adolf Hitler talking.
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:11.300]  And so I would say that, and just connecting the dots here, women, get your men by their
[03:01:11.300 --> 03:01:16.440]  earlobes and gently tug them. Go to the PTA meeting. Sit down and read the books that
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:20.280]  your children are being issued in their schools.
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:24.080]  It took a long time for Hitler to rise to power. And the reason I've come back and come
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:29.660]  back and come back to Adolf Hitler is because he had one amazing juggernaut of a machine
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:37.100]  working for him. And what was behind it? Money. You see Thiessen Krupp elevators. That's Fritz
[03:01:37.100 --> 03:01:41.860]  Thiessen's company, the billionaire who bankrolled Hitler. That's Krupp, the cannon maker. You
[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:47.360]  see AEG, Siemens, Merck. These are all Nazi-era companies.
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:51.600]  And I'll also tell you, as you know, Alex, and thanks to you, many of your listeners
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:56.180]  know it, IBM did business with the Nazi the entire duration of the war.
[03:01:56.180 --> 03:02:01.260]  Turns out he was basically their creation. And again, that's a shadow of what they think
[03:02:01.260 --> 03:02:09.520]  of you. Bayer, same thing, shipping out HIV, AIDS blood. They know what they're doing,
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:15.260]  ladies and gentlemen, and they are cold-blooded. That's what unites them, and it's unbelievable.
[03:02:15.260 --> 03:02:19.500]  Here's a quote I partially gave yesterday. It was the best of times. It was the worst
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:23.860]  of times. It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of
[03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:28.700]  belief. It was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of light. It was the season
[03:02:28.700 --> 03:02:32.260]  of darkness. It was the spring of hope. It was the winter of despair.
[03:02:32.260 --> 03:02:36.760]  We had everything before us. We had nothing before us. We were all going direct to heaven.
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:43.000]  We were all going direct the other way. In short, the period was so far like the present
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:49.700]  period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on being received for good or evil
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:54.380]  in the superlative degree of comparison only.
[03:02:54.380 --> 03:02:58.980]  Let's jam in one final call, because I want to hear this. We got Morrissey, I think is
[03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:04.420]  what that says, wants to talk about predictions. Go ahead. Maurice, go ahead.
[03:03:04.420 --> 03:03:08.780]  Yes, gentlemen, how are you? Thank you very much for allowing me to get on.
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:10.780]  Thank you, brother. Don't thank us.
[03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:17.100]  Kudos to both of you. Around the same time, Not Your Show, which I wasn't able to watch,
[03:03:17.100 --> 03:03:21.860]  or your radio program, Alex, because it's not broadcast in South Florida, but videos
[03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:28.540]  via YouTube, as well as Coast to Coast, which I just happened across because I was working
[03:03:28.540 --> 03:03:37.380]  midnights around the time of 9-11. Both programs were responsible for opening my eyes.
[03:03:37.380 --> 03:03:43.740]  I just want to thank both of you, Art Bell indirectly, as he was leaving the programming,
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:51.020]  and George and John yourself. I just wanted to say God bless both of you. Understand that
[03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:58.900]  there are a lot of people who have you, your family, your extended family, that is the
[03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:05.020]  people that you work with and their families, in thoughts and prayers. Really quick, I wanted
[03:04:05.020 --> 03:04:11.980]  to just throw out if maybe either of you, either of your shows, could at some point
[03:04:11.980 --> 03:04:19.580]  have a guest, or a number of guests on, that help individuals that are struggling with
[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:26.660]  the dilemma of people that are very close to them, immediate families, so to speak,
[03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:29.100]  who don't have their eyes wide open and their ears-
[03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:33.500]  Sure. We need to do some basic shows about the history of the New World Order, what its
[03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:39.860]  goals are, you name it. CaravanToMidnight.com, JBWells.com. JBWells, call the callers. Everybody's
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:45.620]  sorry to a few callers we can't get to. Back Sunday, four to six PM. Thank you, Mr. Wells.
[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:50.620]  Thank you, Alex. Take care. There goes John B. Wells. I am your host, Alex Jones, signing
[03:04:50.620 --> 03:04:57.620]  off for now. Very special stuff tonight on InfoWars Nightly News. Seven o'clock Central.
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:05:10.420]  You do not want to miss it. It'll be on InfoWars tomorrow.
