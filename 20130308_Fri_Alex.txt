[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.680 --> 00:20.600]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.600 --> 00:33.240]  And happy Friday. Alex Jones show, Catherine Albrecht filling in for Alex. My last day
[00:33.240 --> 00:39.440]  here with you guys. What a delight to be part of the Alex Jones Freedom Empire making its
[00:39.440 --> 00:43.780]  way across the globe here. I've been hearing from people in New Zealand. I've been hearing
[00:43.780 --> 00:48.280]  from people across Europe. I've been hearing from people in South America. Amazing how
[00:48.280 --> 00:51.880]  this freedom message, we here in the U.S. think that we're kind of the epicenter of
[00:51.880 --> 00:55.920]  freedom. And I think in a lot of ways, we are, especially if you're in a place like
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.760]  North Korea. You're probably looking out at the shining beacon of the U.S. But people
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.440]  are waking up to this message all over the globe in large measure because of programs
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.680]  like this one, in large measure because of the Internet, which is enabling us to get
[01:10.680 --> 01:14.280]  this message out. And, you know, I really think we have a brief window of time to do
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.640]  it too, because you know that the globalists have their plan. The government would very
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.460]  much like to shut all of this down. No more of that conversing. You know, I have this
[01:24.460 --> 01:31.320]  book on my floor to ceiling bookshelf of 20th century history. And it is all about the laws
[01:31.320 --> 01:35.060]  that were enacted in the Soviet Union. It's a really boring book, you know, just page
[01:35.060 --> 01:41.800]  after page of legal. It's translated in English, but it was a Russian law book or a Soviet
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.640]  law book in the Cold War. And in there, do you know that the Soviets actually required
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.160]  back in the day when they had mimeographed machines and they were first coming out with
[01:51.160 --> 01:57.760]  photocopiers that you had to get a permit in order to make copies of just a piece of
[01:57.760 --> 02:03.760]  paper? I'm looking at that going, OK, well, that is that's some serious top down control
[02:03.760 --> 02:08.960]  there because they didn't want in the same way that the British back in the days of the
[02:08.960 --> 02:12.680]  founding fathers of the U.S., they didn't want more than a couple of people gathering
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.120]  at a time. That's why that that particular right is right there in the U.S. Constitution
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.440]  in the Bill of Rights. They don't want people getting together. They don't want people disseminating
[02:21.440 --> 02:26.120]  information because if they can control all the information, of course, in the Soviet
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.320]  Union, they control the newspapers, they control the radio, they control the television. They
[02:30.320 --> 02:33.960]  were it. You had your state controlled media and that was all there was. And they didn't
[02:33.960 --> 02:39.080]  want people even making mimeographed copies. Anybody older, old enough to remember in the
[02:39.080 --> 02:44.840]  60s and 70s, those drum roller machines with the purple ink that would be all fuzzy? Your
[02:44.840 --> 02:49.640]  teacher would would give you a handout and still be wet. It'd be like damp from the roller
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.200]  thing. And they had a particular smell about them. Well, you know, in those days, I'm sure
[02:54.200 --> 02:58.720]  even for teachers to hand out worksheets to their students, they had to get literally
[02:58.720 --> 03:04.440]  a permit from the government. And I as I look at what's going on today, I think, my gosh,
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.760]  it would be fun just to teleport Stalin just ever so briefly into the modern era and just
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.680]  watch his like smoke come out of his ears and watch him absolutely flip out because
[03:14.680 --> 03:20.160]  we've got the power beyond photocopies. My goodness, we've we've got the power to reach
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.440]  literally hundreds of millions of people and I'm so glad we're doing it. All right. Well,
[03:24.440 --> 03:29.080]  my name is Catherine Albrecht. If you're not familiar with my work, I'm the RFID lady.
[03:29.080 --> 03:35.320]  I've been working on the issue of consumer privacy, shopper privacy, and fighting against
[03:35.320 --> 03:40.760]  the encroachment of radio frequency ID devices, whether it's in products, or as we're going
[03:40.760 --> 03:46.880]  to be talking about this hour in furniture, heaven forbid, or the worst case of all on
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.240]  human beings or even in human beings. And we talked about that a little bit this hour
[03:51.240 --> 03:57.760]  as well. The RFID microchip is merging with the cell phone is merging with the global
[03:57.760 --> 04:03.440]  brain is merging with the internet, it's all coming together. And it's not a mistake, as
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.840]  I've said before, on this show in my own program, that it's a web, it is called a web, because
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.920]  there's a spider sitting at the center of it, it is called a net, because there's somebody
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.520]  holding the net. And you may think that you're in charge of a lot of this technology and
[04:17.520 --> 04:23.480]  in a lot of ways we are. But when it comes right down to it, this net, this web is not
[04:23.480 --> 04:26.320]  only going to be a place through which we can communicate with one another, but it's
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.320]  going to be a place through which this global thing is going to have its eyes and ears on
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.560]  all of us. All right, we'll be talking about that this hour, also opening up for your phone
[04:35.560 --> 04:41.680]  calls a little bit later this hour. Microchip markets RFID technology that transmits via
[04:41.680 --> 04:46.720]  the human body. Yeah, that and we've got a new Wall Street Journal article out about
[04:46.720 --> 04:50.320]  how companies are tracking their employees. All right, all that and more when we come
[04:50.320 --> 04:59.320]  back. Catherine Albrecht filling in for Alex Jones. More right after this.

[06:03.000 --> 06:07.680]  of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[06:07.680 --> 06:12.620]  and my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[06:12.620 --> 06:16.780]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[06:16.780 --> 06:22.480]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[06:22.480 --> 06:28.240]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.160]  and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are
[06:33.160 --> 06:37.720]  designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have
[06:37.720 --> 06:44.260]  to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months. Simply getting the

[08:07.160 --> 08:14.120]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[08:14.120 --> 08:25.520]  TV. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:25.520 --> 08:55.480]  It is our town. It's our country. It's our planet in case you haven't noticed that
[08:55.480 --> 09:00.160]  lately with all you pond scum out there. Yeah, the globalists want to think it's their town,
[09:00.160 --> 09:06.680]  but they are a tiny, mincy, miniscule little fraction of the mass of humanity that lives
[09:06.680 --> 09:11.740]  on this planet. And it really is time for us to remind them of that, especially because
[09:11.740 --> 09:16.120]  we've got a constitution that makes it very clear that these folks are our servants. So
[09:16.120 --> 09:20.480]  I'm always pleased when I see that at least on the local level, the local and the state
[09:20.480 --> 09:24.900]  level that the people who are getting elected kind of still get that, you know, it hasn't
[09:24.900 --> 09:29.960]  gone totally to their heads in the way that it has on the federal level. And on my own
[09:29.960 --> 09:33.680]  radio program, this is of course the Alex Jones Show and I'm Catherine Albrecht filling
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.240]  in for Alex. I do my own radio show for two hours Monday through Friday. And on Fridays,
[09:39.240 --> 09:43.600]  I always kind of try to dispel a little bit of the darkness that we've been looking at
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.860]  all week long. And I do a little thing called Good News Friday. Well, I want to give you
[09:48.860 --> 09:51.800]  just a couple of the good news stories, just a little preview of what I'm going to be talking
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.920]  about on my show. And I want to share some of the positive stories that are coming out.
[09:56.920 --> 10:01.480]  It's always good news when we have something positive going on. Well, let me tell you,
[10:01.480 --> 10:07.100]  the state of Ohio is considering a ban against traffic cameras. Wouldn't that be a good thing?
[10:07.100 --> 10:12.460]  You know, the idea that the state has its eyes on all of our cars is really disturbing.
[10:12.460 --> 10:16.280]  We know that not only can the traffic cameras now zoom in and see your face or determine
[10:16.280 --> 10:22.600]  whether you're grimacing or scowling or smiling as you sit there at the red light, they're
[10:22.600 --> 10:28.200]  also able now to do automatic license plate recognition in a lot of municipalities. And
[10:28.200 --> 10:35.040]  this is a big income source for these communities. Well, there's a court in Ohio that has said,
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.380]  no, you can't be doing this. Let me just read you the article here. This is out of W Ohio
[10:40.380 --> 10:46.080]  TV. They say the days of red light and speed cameras at Ohio intersections could be numbered.
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.320]  A Hamilton County court judge ruled Thursday, that would be yesterday, that a traffic camera
[10:51.320 --> 10:57.840]  ordinance in a little small village near Cincinnati cannot be enforced. Yeah. Now this is interesting.
[10:57.840 --> 11:04.760]  Listen to the stats on this. You guys will die. All right. Only 2,188 people live in
[11:04.760 --> 11:10.520]  Elmwood Place, Ohio, right? Just a little small town, 2,000 people approximately. But
[11:10.520 --> 11:17.400]  cameras have caught more than 20,000 drivers speeding through town in just the last, well,
[11:17.400 --> 11:20.680]  less than a year. They just installed these things in September of last year. So just
[11:20.680 --> 11:25.200]  a couple of months, 20,000 drivers getting tickets. You gotta be kidding me. Well, what
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.840]  are they making off of this? $1.5 million in September of last year. October, November,
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.640]  December, that's like what, three months? Wait, no, three months of 2012, five months
[11:36.640 --> 11:42.920]  worth? 1.5 million bucks. You know why these guys are doing it. Yeah. In the decision,
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.560]  the judge said, well, not enough signage warning the motorists. They're not calibrating them.
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.720]  It's a for-profit company, a whole bunch of problems with this. But I am delighted to
[11:51.720 --> 11:56.520]  see that not only is the court striking this down, but there's even bipartisan legislation
[11:56.520 --> 12:02.380]  introduced in the state of Ohio to knock out those traffic cameras. We've been seeing legislation
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.000]  like this introduced in other states, and I would say this is an encouraging move. Wherever
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.920]  you're located, you may want to consider lobbying for those cameras to be shut down. You know
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.200]  they do a lot more than just monitor people who are violating the law. Yeah, they can
[12:17.200 --> 12:21.000]  also use them for really any purpose they want to, and we ought to probably put the
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.400]  brakes on that. So I would encourage you to get involved in that movement against the
[12:26.400 --> 12:31.480]  eyes of the state being on every street corner. All right, the other bit of good news this
[12:31.480 --> 12:38.680]  week, I know it's kind of, I suppose it's good news, TSA allowing knives and golf clubs
[12:38.680 --> 12:44.160]  back on U.S. planes. I say I suppose it's good news because it's about time, isn't it?
[12:44.160 --> 12:47.520]  You know, like next they're going to tell us we're going to be allowed to have a conversation
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.760]  on the plane. It's pretty bad when they take away your rights and then they give them back
[12:51.760 --> 12:55.800]  to you piecemeal and we say, oh, thank you, government, sir. Thank you, thank you that
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.120]  we're allowed to do something that people have been doing for years and years before
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.720]  you took those rights away. But the U.S. TSA has said that it will allow people to carry
[13:03.720 --> 13:09.240]  small pocket knives onto passenger planes for the first time since the September 11th
[13:09.240 --> 13:15.920]  terrorist attacks along with golf clubs, hockey sticks and plastic wiffle ball style bats.
[13:15.920 --> 13:21.800]  Can you believe that it's been illegal for over 10 years now to carry a wiffle ball bat
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.400]  onto an airplane? Yeah, just try beating somebody over the head with that. You know, they've
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.260]  got the holes in them. They don't do much. All right. The agency will permit knives with
[13:31.260 --> 13:37.760]  retractable blades shorter than 2.3 inches. So we're talking just the barest tiny of pocket
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.360]  knives here and narrower than one half inch. The new rules are going to take effect at
[13:43.360 --> 13:49.260]  the end of April. Now, they're also going to allow sticks used to play lacrosse, billiards
[13:49.260 --> 13:54.620]  and hockey, ski poles and as many as two golf clubs. Yeah, you know, because if you have
[13:54.620 --> 13:58.620]  three or four, you could you could get in big trouble with that. All right. The flight
[13:58.620 --> 14:04.300]  attendants having a hissy fit about this. I'm not sure why they get so upset about pocket
[14:04.300 --> 14:08.680]  knives. How many pocket knife attacks did we really have before they banned the pocket
[14:08.680 --> 14:14.520]  knives? Really? Realistically? Most men I know, especially in certain parts of the country
[14:14.520 --> 14:17.800]  in the south, actually carried a pocket knife. It was just part of the stuff in their pockets
[14:17.800 --> 14:24.480]  along with their keys and their change and their wallets. And you didn't see a rash of
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.260]  tiny knife attacks on the airplane. So that's I suppose that's good news. They're letting
[14:28.260 --> 14:33.280]  us do that again. I've got another law out of Texas. Speaking of local lawmakers who
[14:33.280 --> 14:40.480]  are my heroes, got to say, Texas is now proposing one of the nation's most sweeping mobile privacy
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.620]  laws. If signed into law, this is such a no brainer, but if signed into law, cops would
[14:45.620 --> 14:50.840]  actually have to get a warrant before they could use your phone to track you and get
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.320]  your location data. Now, a pair of new mobile privacy bills recently introduced in the state
[14:55.320 --> 15:01.260]  of Texas are among the, quote, most sweeping ever seen. Yeah, they actually offer better
[15:01.260 --> 15:05.780]  protection on the Texas state level than a couple of similar bills introduced in Congress
[15:05.780 --> 15:11.740]  this week. If passed, they would establish a probable cause requirement. Yeah, you'd
[15:11.740 --> 15:16.640]  have to get a warrant. You'd have to show probable cause in order to obtain location
[15:16.640 --> 15:23.920]  information from GPS devices and also tap and trace and cell phone tower location data.
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.380]  This data, if the bill passes, would only be disclosed to law enforcement, quote, if
[15:28.380 --> 15:33.360]  there's probable cause to believe the records disclosing location information will provide
[15:33.360 --> 15:38.900]  evidence in a criminal investigation. It's about flipping time, don't you think? All
[15:38.900 --> 15:46.620]  right. So I got to tell you, I am always delighted when we see on the state and local level,
[15:46.620 --> 15:53.400]  you know, these kinds of bills getting introduced. I have already years ago, I gave up on the
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.640]  federal government, although I got to say I was pretty pleased with Rand Paul and his
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.220]  filibuster here over the last couple of days. So I think there is still some stuff that
[16:01.220 --> 16:05.820]  can be done on the federal level. But if you're really looking to make change, I believe that
[16:05.820 --> 16:09.700]  that change is going to be happening on the local and the state level. Joining me later
[16:09.700 --> 16:15.540]  this the third hour of today's program, John Woods, excuse me, Tom Woods and I are going
[16:15.540 --> 16:21.180]  to be talking about nullification and state rights as well. So stay tuned for that. We'll
[16:21.180 --> 16:27.100]  definitely be getting into where the power structure is and where we as individuals can
[16:27.100 --> 16:31.080]  actually get in there and make some changes. All right. Well, that's I got a couple more
[16:31.080 --> 16:35.520]  bits of good news, but I think that's probably enough to tide us over for the moment. I now
[16:35.520 --> 16:40.460]  want to turn our attention to something that's maybe a little bit more disturbing. And you
[16:40.460 --> 16:44.180]  guys, if you've been following my work at all, and I know Alex has talked about this
[16:44.180 --> 16:50.780]  extensively on the show as well, we are fighting against the tagging of students in San Antonio,
[16:50.780 --> 16:57.660]  Texas with RFID tracking beacons around their necks. And one of the reasons that we've said,
[16:57.660 --> 17:02.980]  hey, listen, this tracking pilot program at two schools down there, 4200 kids being forced
[17:02.980 --> 17:08.660]  to wear a lanyard with a battery powered ID tag around their necks that sends out a signal
[17:08.660 --> 17:13.340]  that's monitored every 25 seconds and recorded in a giant database so they know where all
[17:13.340 --> 17:18.620]  the kids are all the time, all day long. But it's going to set a bad precedent for the
[17:18.620 --> 17:22.380]  future, right? Those kids are going to grow up. And what is school all about? Well, school
[17:22.380 --> 17:27.340]  is about conditioning kids. It's really not about education. And I can't help myself.
[17:27.340 --> 17:32.900]  I got to share this other story with you. The other breaking news today, most new New
[17:32.900 --> 17:38.660]  York City high school grads cannot read. Basic skills like reading, writing and math need
[17:38.660 --> 17:45.860]  to be relearned. Nearly 80% of New York City high school graduates have to relearn basic
[17:45.860 --> 17:51.260]  skills like reading before they can enter the city university's community college system.
[17:51.260 --> 17:56.460]  All right, so this story just down today. So let's clarify this because my background
[17:56.460 --> 18:00.420]  is in education. I have a doctorate from Harvard University in education. This is what I do.
[18:00.420 --> 18:06.140]  It's what I've done my whole life. And I can say that as far as education goes, the government
[18:06.140 --> 18:11.220]  schools, obviously, if 80% of kids graduating from them can't read or write, you would say
[18:11.220 --> 18:15.660]  that they're a failure, right? Well, if you talk to John Taylor Gatto, who I knew has
[18:15.660 --> 18:20.100]  been a guest on this program in the past, who's written the Underground History of American
[18:20.100 --> 18:25.140]  Education, a former New York Teacher of the Year, so he knows what he's talking about.
[18:25.140 --> 18:29.980]  He'll come right out and tell you the schools are failing. The schools are succeeding brilliantly.
[18:29.980 --> 18:35.500]  They're doing exactly what they were set out to do, which is to condition kids to accept
[18:35.500 --> 18:41.060]  keeping their mouth shut, keeping their heads low, obeying authority and staying in line.
[18:41.060 --> 18:45.580]  That's what the schools are about. And they succeed in that brilliantly. So when you take
[18:45.580 --> 18:49.580]  a look, now let's turn our attention away from New York, where 80% of kids can't read.
[18:49.580 --> 18:55.080]  And now let's look back at Texas, where you've got 4200 kids as part of a trial this year,
[18:55.080 --> 18:58.340]  with these remotely readable tracking devices around their necks. What do you think they're
[18:58.340 --> 19:02.260]  learning? What do you think they're teaching these kids? Well, they're teaching them to
[19:02.260 --> 19:06.100]  accept this notion that it's appropriate for the people in charge of you. Well, first of
[19:06.100 --> 19:10.540]  all, that there are people in charge of you in large numbers that can segregate, slice
[19:10.540 --> 19:16.060]  and dice you into a little age segregated unit that can then put this thing around your
[19:16.060 --> 19:21.460]  neck and punish you if you fail to wear it, like Andrea Hernandez, who was expelled for
[19:21.460 --> 19:25.520]  refusing to wear her little tracking device around her neck. So, you know, that sends
[19:25.520 --> 19:29.300]  a pretty powerful message. We will expel you. We will punish you. We will make your life
[19:29.300 --> 19:34.020]  miserable unless you don't. Well, already the thing that I've been predicting that this
[19:34.020 --> 19:38.480]  is going to hit the workplace, it's happening. New story out in the Wall Street Journal titled
[19:38.480 --> 19:44.120]  Tracking Sensors Invade the Workplace. There's a new company out there putting trackers not
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.940]  only around employees necks, but even on the furniture that they sit in to determine how
[19:48.940 --> 19:53.020]  often they get up or take breaks. All right, more on that story when we come back. This
[19:53.020 --> 20:03.660]  is The Alex Jones Show. I'm Katherine Albrecht filling in. Stay tuned. If you want an American

[24:22.820 --> 24:29.820]  Hey, we're back. You're listening to the Alex Jones show, of course, Infowars.com,
[24:33.340 --> 24:38.540]  prisonplanet.com. I'm your guest host, Catherine Albrecht, writing shotgun with you for the
[24:38.540 --> 24:41.500]  next couple of hours. I'm going to open up the phone lines here in the next segment.
[24:41.500 --> 24:48.500]  Let me give out that number. It's 1-800-259-9231. That's 1-800-259-9231. If you'd like to call
[24:48.500 --> 24:55.500]  in with a question or a comment about any of the topics we're talking about this hour,
[24:55.560 --> 25:02.560]  I want to get into this whole concept of tracking people, becoming a normal part of life. And
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.360]  if they can get it into the schools, they always want to start with the kids. You know,
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.400]  as I said last week when I was a guest in studio with Alex, it's really about conditioning
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.280]  the kids. You know, Hitler said, I don't care about you adults who oppose me because I've
[25:17.280 --> 25:21.800]  already got your kids. See, that's where they want to go. And we look at the schools. They've
[25:21.800 --> 25:26.640]  got our kids in the schools. They're clearly doing a horrific job of educating them. But
[25:26.640 --> 25:31.160]  that's not what the schools are about, at least not according to John Taylor Gatto.
[25:31.160 --> 25:37.840]  He says the schools are about conditioning compliant adult units to function in the economy
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.480]  and to take the boring factory jobs and to sit at a boring desk and, you know, work for
[25:43.480 --> 25:49.960]  them until they're 65 and then take the government-issued retirement and just be good worker drones.
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.360]  That's what the schools are about. And they do a great job of that. Think about it all
[25:53.360 --> 25:57.360]  day long. What are your kids told? You know, I was thinking about this recently. I was
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.520]  at church and most of the kids at my church are homeschooled. But one of the kids who's
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.000]  schooled at a government school and he was doing something, like taking water out of
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.400]  the water fountain and spraying it around the room or something. And I walked over to
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.960]  him and I said, excuse me, where are we? Can you tell me what building we're in? Like,
[26:14.960 --> 26:18.960]  is it appropriate to be spewing the water? Where are we? And he just looked at me like
[26:18.960 --> 26:22.440]  a deer in the headlights. You know, I wanted to say, well, we're at church. I was going
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.480]  to say, well, church is probably not a good place to be, you know, doing what you're doing.
[26:26.480 --> 26:30.560]  But he just looked at me and I realized I've tried several times to just even say hello
[26:30.560 --> 26:34.880]  or good morning or just have a little chat with this kid. And he never says anything.
[26:34.880 --> 26:39.880]  He's almost mute. And yet, you know, he can sit there and play his video games. He's got
[26:39.880 --> 26:44.880]  a little thumb on the machine. And I got to thinking, why is it that kids nowadays, kids
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.040]  who are government schooled, don't look you in the eye and they can't carry on a conversation
[26:49.040 --> 26:53.280]  with you? Whereas homeschooled kids do. In fact, that's always the difference. You can
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.880]  tell the homeschooled kids because they look you in the eye. They can speak. They've got
[26:57.880 --> 27:01.360]  ideas. They interact. They go back and forth. But the government schooled kids, they just
[27:01.360 --> 27:04.880]  kind of shrink away and stare at you with these wide-eyed stares or else they just look
[27:04.880 --> 27:10.100]  at the floor. And I realized, what's the reason? What is the message that they get from the
[27:10.100 --> 27:15.880]  time they get to class in the morning until the time they leave? Don't talk. Be quiet.
[27:15.880 --> 27:20.440]  Keep your voice down. Don't talk. Be quiet. All day long, they're told not to talk. So
[27:20.440 --> 27:25.440]  is it any surprise that we're creating an entire generation, an entire country full
[27:25.440 --> 27:31.120]  of people who do not know how to even speak, much less speak up against wrongdoing, but
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.720]  literally even speak at all? I've heard about people going on dates and they're literally
[27:36.720 --> 27:42.080]  like texting each other across the table from their little handheld devices rather than
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.520]  having actual conversations. So I think this ties in with this article out of the Wall
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.920]  Street Journal, the sensor tracking article. They're talking about furniture being outfitted
[27:52.920 --> 28:01.360]  with RFID receptor devices and also having these RFID devices around people's necks.
[28:01.360 --> 28:08.120]  This started at Bank of America. By the way, we got a breaking news story. I got to share
[28:08.120 --> 28:12.560]  this with you really quickly and we're coming up on a break in a moment. But TSA screeners
[28:12.560 --> 28:19.120]  allow federal agent with fake bomb to pass through security at Newark Airport. That's
[28:19.120 --> 28:23.720]  breaking news out of the New York Post. We'll be posting that up on Infowars.com and or
[28:23.720 --> 28:29.760]  Prison Planet. So you get the breaking news right first right here on this radio program.
[28:29.760 --> 28:33.760]  This is the Alex Jones show, of course. All right. Speaking of sensors, you know, maybe
[28:33.760 --> 28:37.680]  that's what they're going to do at the airports now. Just outfit everybody with a sensor.
[28:37.680 --> 28:42.080]  Did you hear the proposal a couple of years ago to actually put cameras onto the seat
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.640]  backs so they could sit there and watch you on the airplane? Yeah. Well, the only reason
[28:47.640 --> 28:52.680]  that didn't fly is a lot. Excuse the pun. That didn't fly because the frequent fliers
[28:52.680 --> 28:57.280]  said, heck no, you know, we're paying hundreds of bucks for these tickets. And that's the
[28:57.280 --> 29:00.880]  one place where we actually recognize that it's us you're going to be looking at rather
[29:00.880 --> 29:06.680]  than the terrorist. Well, Bank of America a couple of years ago wanted to study how
[29:06.680 --> 29:11.960]  people were interacting with one another. So they asked 90 workers to wear these badges,
[29:11.960 --> 29:16.480]  the same kind of thing they're using at the school down in San Antonio, to wear these
[29:16.480 --> 29:22.280]  badges with tiny sensors to record their movements. And get this, they could even record their
[29:22.280 --> 29:27.080]  conversations and their tone of voice in the conversations. My question for you, why the
[29:27.080 --> 29:31.720]  heck would 90 people agree to do that? If your employer asked you voluntarily to wear
[29:31.720 --> 29:35.640]  a thing around your neck that would record your conversations? I really hope you'd say
[29:35.640 --> 29:40.680]  no, thank you. All right, I'm Catherine Albrecht filling in for Alex Jones. And we'll be right
[29:40.680 --> 29:49.560]  back and checking your phone calls right after this 800-259-9231. Stay tuned.
[29:49.560 --> 29:56.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[30:09.200 --> 30:14.400]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally
[30:14.400 --> 30:19.280]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[30:19.280 --> 30:25.040]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary
[30:25.040 --> 30:30.440]  exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[30:30.440 --> 30:35.040]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[30:35.040 --> 30:40.600]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[30:40.600 --> 30:45.560]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[30:45.560 --> 30:51.680]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[33:41.040 --> 33:46.800]  the Alex Jones show and delightful being here with you. We're opening up the phone lines
[33:46.800 --> 33:51.440]  right now and before we do that, I just wanted to make a couple of notes about health. We're
[33:51.440 --> 33:55.800]  going to be talking about health a little bit in the second hour of today's program,
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.600]  particularly complementary and alternative ways that you can deal with cancer. One of
[34:00.600 --> 34:05.040]  the things that's been kind of at the forefront of my life the last couple of years, as I've
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.280]  discussed on Alex Jones' show and I think Alex was one of the first to break the story,
[34:09.280 --> 34:16.320]  I actually had stage 3C breast cancer, really nasty, locally advanced breast cancer and
[34:16.320 --> 34:23.480]  I am so excited because I just began on Wednesday the clinical trial of a new drug called, it's
[34:23.480 --> 34:28.480]  a mouthful, Tetra Thiomalibdate. This is a drug that's not funded by any pharmaceutical
[34:28.480 --> 34:32.480]  company. It is cheap enough. You can salt the roads with it. There's not big bucks behind
[34:32.480 --> 34:39.480]  it but there is the folks at Cornell University, Dr. Linda Vidot is the researcher on this
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.120]  and I've got to tell you, there's a big story coming out next week in the New York Times
[34:44.120 --> 34:50.920]  about this. She just published her results in the Annals of Oncology. I am patient number
[34:50.920 --> 34:57.460]  60 on this phase 2 clinical trial of this drug to prevent recurrence of breast cancer
[34:57.460 --> 35:01.360]  and I've got to tell you, I think this woman has cured breast cancer because the way this
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.200]  disease kills you is it comes back. You know, you treat it and it's gone and you're in remission
[35:06.200 --> 35:11.920]  and then 3, 5, 10, 20 years go by and then if it does come back and metastasizes then
[35:11.920 --> 35:17.560]  that's all she wrote. Well, the women that she's been treating, stage 4 cancer patients
[35:17.560 --> 35:23.040]  who normally have less than a two-year lifespan are now six years out with no evidence of
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.800]  disease whatsoever. It's extraordinary. It's amazing stuff. I've blogged about it on my
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.400]  blog. If you go to CatherineAlbrecht.com or I know that's hard to spell. You can just
[35:32.400 --> 35:39.220]  try KMAshow.com. Click on the blog. You can see all the links right there. There are still
[35:39.220 --> 35:43.040]  spaces. I just spoke to her on Wednesday. She gave me permission to talk about it on
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.440]  the show before the New York Times article comes out next week. There are still spaces
[35:47.440 --> 35:54.280]  for a dozen more women on there. The key though is the women have to be stage 3 or stage 4
[35:54.280 --> 35:58.040]  at high risk of breast cancer recurrence. They have to have no evidence of disease,
[35:58.040 --> 36:04.200]  in other words, no active tumors and I believe she's taking stage 2 triple negative breast
[36:04.200 --> 36:07.480]  cancer patients. So you heard it first here. You're going to be hearing it in the New York
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.800]  Times next week and when that hits, I've got to say I'm so excited. I am patient number
[36:13.800 --> 36:19.320]  60 on that trial. No side effects as far as we can tell other than preventing the cancer
[36:19.320 --> 36:23.560]  from coming back. Sounds mighty good to me. All right, I do want to get back to the phone
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.120]  lines here. I also want to remind you that InfoWars Shop is where you can go to get
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.760]  all your InfoWars gear and also please make a point of supporting the sponsors here on
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.260]  this radio program. And finally, speaking of health, Alex is in great health. I in no
[36:38.260 --> 36:44.760]  way believe that he has taken this week to do anything other than wrestle cactuses with
[36:44.760 --> 36:50.840]  his bare hands, I think was the email that came in earlier this week. So Alex is in absolutely
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.600]  fabulous health. I got to visit with him last week and we just want to keep in that way
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.440]  so I am glad that he is able to get just a little bit of a break. I know it can be a
[37:00.440 --> 37:05.840]  lot of work running the huge InfoWars empire. So when he comes back, I know he is going
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.040]  to be tanned, rested and ready to take on the new world order. And I know you guys are
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.760]  helping him do that, so keep it up. All right, phone lines are open 1-800-259-9231. Let's
[37:16.760 --> 37:19.880]  go to Noel listening in Illinois. Hello.
[37:19.880 --> 37:27.960]  Yes, hello. Big fan of your work, Catherine. I was watching the cybersecurity hearing yesterday,
[37:27.960 --> 37:35.480]  the Senate hearing, and it just got me thinking again knowing that we could be looming on
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.900]  the last days of freedom on the internet. I am a big fan of StartPage.com. I used it
[37:40.900 --> 37:46.600]  a lot during my investigative reporting work to look up some documents away from Google.
[37:46.600 --> 37:55.960]  Any suggestions on, say, email servers or if you are just going to register a website
[37:55.960 --> 38:04.120]  away from a company like GoDaddy who is pro SOPA and CISPA, or any suggestions or recommendations
[38:04.120 --> 38:10.840]  for those who are trying to do their best to prevent malicious attacks online, knowing
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.880]  that websites are tracked? What are ways that we could prevent ourselves online?
[38:14.880 --> 38:18.920]  You know, it's tough stuff. I have actually done a couple of interviews with the folks
[38:18.920 --> 38:25.760]  behind Tor, the onion router, which is probably for the really hardcore folks who really want
[38:25.760 --> 38:29.920]  to restrict their, you know, kind of create a buffer between themselves and the actual
[38:29.920 --> 38:35.960]  internet. You can also use proxy servers. StartPage has a proxy server built in. A lot
[38:35.960 --> 38:39.720]  of people don't realize that, that when you search with StartPage, the private search
[38:39.720 --> 38:43.980]  engine that searches Google for you, but then strips out all the details and erases all
[38:43.980 --> 38:48.040]  records of your visit that I helped to create, so full disclosure there.
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.200]  When you use StartPage, among your StartPage search results, if you look at underneath
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.960]  the results, you'll actually see it says view by xQIC proxy, and if you just want to visit
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.120]  a website privately, and I frequently do this if I'm visiting like the National Institutes
[39:02.120 --> 39:05.800]  of Health looking up cancer research, for example, because I don't particularly want
[39:05.800 --> 39:09.520]  to send them my personal information or pick up one of their tracking cookies, what I'll
[39:09.520 --> 39:13.600]  do is I'll do the search on StartPage, I'll get the results, and then I'll click view
[39:13.600 --> 39:21.040]  by xQIC proxy of, you know, let's say NIH.gov, and when that information comes back, it's
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.320]  been filtered through StartPage. So StartPage goes out, loads the third-party website you
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.360]  want to see onto the StartPage servers, serves it to you, and then deletes all records that
[39:29.360 --> 39:30.720]  you've been there.
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.200]  The Onion Router is similar. I've heard good things, and in fact, my husband had just recently
[39:35.200 --> 39:41.880]  installed Ghostery on my computer to strip out a lot of the third-party tracking cookies
[39:41.880 --> 39:47.960]  and other observation. And, you know, one of the key places is your ISP. You know, that's
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.160]  one of the weak links because your ISP is aware of all the websites that you're visiting
[39:52.160 --> 39:58.440]  unless they're HTTPS encrypted. So StartPage was actually the first search engine to incorporate
[39:58.440 --> 40:04.520]  HTTPS or SSL encryption just by default, but it means that your ISP can't observe what
[40:04.520 --> 40:05.560]  you're doing.
[40:05.560 --> 40:09.440]  And one of the things I want to encourage StartPage to develop as soon as we get our
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.640]  private email out there, the alternative to Gmail, is I want to encourage StartPage to
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.880]  develop a DNS lookup service because the DNS is another place where every website that
[40:19.880 --> 40:24.000]  you're visiting, it's got to be resolved. They've got to resolve the DNS address, the
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.120]  IP address, and that's all being recorded as well.
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.200]  So it's a huge question. We could probably do three hours just on that alone, Noel, but
[40:32.200 --> 40:35.920]  I would say just keep an eye on what StartPage is doing because we're working on a lot of
[40:35.920 --> 40:37.320]  those privacy products.
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.520]  Oh, well, thank you so much. And what was that program you just mentioned about the
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.840]  cookies? I've been aware about cookies as well. Did you say Ghostery?
[40:45.840 --> 40:54.200]  Ghostery. Yeah, G-H-O-S-T-E-R-Y, Ghostery. And I haven't sat down. I've been in a whirlwind
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.520]  lately so I've not sat down to do the full top to bottom review, but my husband has and
[40:58.520 --> 41:04.200]  he thought it was good enough to put it on our office computers and our home computers.
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.760]  And it's been kind of cool because I get less garbage. So check that one out too and I'll
[41:10.760 --> 41:12.720]  keep folks posted on that.
[41:12.720 --> 41:17.700]  My website, by the way, kmashow.com, these are the kinds of things I talk about on my
[41:17.700 --> 41:23.760]  radio show. So if you're interested in that kind of information as it crosses my desk,
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.240]  that's usually where I get it out to folks. So thanks for the call, Noel. I appreciate
[41:27.240 --> 41:28.240]  your interest.
[41:28.240 --> 41:32.080]  Let's go to Zach listening in Tennessee. Good afternoon, Zach, or good morning, wherever
[41:32.080 --> 41:33.080]  you are. Hello.
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.720]  Yes, ma'am. First of all, I want to start out and say that you do a great job with your
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.800]  analysis, the way that you're kind of calm like the Hagman's. I think a lot of people
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.080]  like Alex's style like I do because they're either football players or military, but for
[41:47.080 --> 41:50.640]  a lot of the women and people who aren't awake yet, I think your style is really good. And
[41:50.640 --> 41:56.200]  uh, I was going to ask you, yes ma'am. Um, did you hear, uh, Mike Adams a couple of weeks
[41:56.200 --> 42:00.500]  ago and Alex Jones, he was talking about, you know, it will be amazing if we can even
[42:00.500 --> 42:05.960]  survive the next 50 years. And then I heard you talking to Alex about Ray Kurzweil. I
[42:05.960 --> 42:12.120]  didn't know if you saw the, uh, the Sunday, February 24th edition of coast to coast AM,
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.960]  but he was on there and they were talking about, you know, having these ships that were
[42:16.960 --> 42:23.800]  the size of blood cells by the time, uh, 2013 or 2030, I'm sorry, rolls around. And so,
[42:23.800 --> 42:28.480]  I mean, that's only 17 years off. So that kind of correlates with what Mike Adams said
[42:28.480 --> 42:33.320]  about surviving the next 50 years. And I didn't know what you mean. Yeah, it depends on what
[42:33.320 --> 42:37.520]  you mean by surviving because I think everybody feels like we're, we're really starting to
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.200]  move very quickly in a particular direction. And Ray Kurzweil is interesting because his
[42:42.200 --> 42:46.560]  book, the singularity is, it starts off, even if you don't read the whole book, if you can
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.520]  just read the first chapter, it starts off talking about what an exponential growth curve
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.720]  looks like. And for those, for people who aren't mathematically inclined, it essentially
[42:55.720 --> 43:01.100]  means that for us to double the amount of technology we had back in, I don't know, 5,000
[43:01.100 --> 43:07.040]  BC took like a thousand years or 3000, whatever, and then to double it, it begins doubling
[43:07.040 --> 43:12.600]  in shorter and shorter increments of time. So all of the technology, I'm making these
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.040]  numbers up, but like between 1800 and 1900, you had a doubling. And now you're having
[43:17.040 --> 43:21.560]  this doubling literally within a matter of weeks or even days where we are absolutely
[43:21.560 --> 43:28.040]  at this exponential fast pace. And his, his, um, whole theory here about the singularity
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.040]  is that it is going to begin increasing at a rate that we humanly can't keep track of
[43:33.040 --> 43:38.240]  and that we will actually have to incorporate the computer network inside of our own brains
[43:38.240 --> 43:43.200]  or chips in our brains to even keep track of the pace of technological change. And that
[43:43.200 --> 43:48.040]  at some point you talk about survival, at some point we will dump what he refers to,
[43:48.040 --> 43:52.540]  you know, you know, paraphrase here, but basically these meat packages that we walk around in
[43:52.540 --> 43:59.440]  called bodies and we will upload ourselves into this gigantic, a virtual matrix that's
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.200]  this computer network. And once we're in that, it won't matter if the earth becomes too polluted
[44:04.200 --> 44:08.880]  to live on because we will all just be bits and bytes in some vast giant computerized
[44:08.880 --> 44:13.640]  brain. Now, what I think is so interesting about that is that it pretty much does correspond
[44:13.640 --> 44:17.280]  to what the Bible talks about as well in the book of Revelation, that there's going to
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.480]  be a time when everything is going to become numerical. We're going to have these numbers
[44:21.480 --> 44:26.600]  in our right hands or our foreheads. And when we take that, or when we bow down to that,
[44:26.600 --> 44:32.040]  when we become a part of that, when we worship that, that that's pretty much all she wrote.
[44:32.040 --> 44:37.800]  At least in terms of, you know, your ability to ever come in contact with God, to say the
[44:37.800 --> 44:43.000]  least. And I think the two are one in the same. I really do. I believe that this whole
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.120]  notion of uploading yourself for safekeeping or immortality into the computer system is
[44:48.120 --> 44:53.120]  going to be a form of handing your soul, literally removing your soul from your body and handing
[44:53.120 --> 44:58.240]  it over to this thing we're building. And the thing we're building, I think, as I mentioned
[44:58.240 --> 45:01.680]  on Alex's show last week, I think what we're building is the body of the beast. I think
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.400]  we're actually building the thing that this dark spirit is going to inhabit. So yeah,
[45:06.400 --> 45:10.320]  the future, I don't know. You know, people say, is it coming tomorrow? When's it all
[45:10.320 --> 45:15.040]  going to end? And I say, we really don't know. You know, we don't. It could be thousands
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.400]  of years, it could be, you know, a handful of years. But I will say this, we are the
[45:19.400 --> 45:24.000]  first generation to ever live on planet Earth that has the ability to implement the mark
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.520]  of the beast. And that's happened since I became an activist in 1999. I've watched it
[45:28.520 --> 45:33.520]  happen just in the last 12, 13 years that we have that ability. So it's it's happening
[45:33.520 --> 45:36.120]  really quickly. I'm with you there.
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.960]  The way he was trying to sell it is that your brain can only take in like you said, like
[45:39.960 --> 45:45.120]  300 million items of information. And after that, you have to archive and dismiss it.
[45:45.120 --> 45:49.640]  So he was basically saying that by, you know, taking these blood size or blood cell size
[45:49.640 --> 45:53.640]  chips that, you know, like you said, it's just like if you rewatch the Matrix, how they
[45:53.640 --> 45:59.480]  upload into the Matrix and get all these programs and software. But if you look at the Matrix,
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.800]  at that point, are you even human anymore? You know, Ray Kurzweil, and there's another
[46:03.800 --> 46:08.640]  guy named Peter Cochrane, C-O-C-H-R-A-N-E. He wrote, he has a blog, he's with British
[46:08.640 --> 46:13.680]  Telecom, he's kind of the Ray Kurzweil of England. And he actually wrote this really
[46:13.680 --> 46:19.840]  creepy blog entry that talks about how when his dad died, that he would have given anything.
[46:19.840 --> 46:24.800]  And you know, anytime you say I'd give anything, cue the dark music, right? He said he would
[46:24.800 --> 46:30.120]  give anything to remain in contact with that consciousness that was his father. And, you
[46:30.120 --> 46:33.280]  know, once you start talking about trying to revive the dead or stay in contact with
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.960]  the dead, then you open yourself up to all kinds of disturbing things. And what he, in
[46:37.960 --> 46:45.000]  this article talks about, is how we will all become one single unified consciousness across
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.120]  not just the globe, but the universe. And then we will travel out into the universe
[46:50.120 --> 46:56.540]  looking for host bodies to inhabit. Now, this is not a religious guy, this is a technologist.
[46:56.540 --> 47:01.040]  So this whole idea that your brain can't contain it all, or your body can't even contain your
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.640]  own brain, that you're going to have to get out there and become sort of at one with this
[47:05.640 --> 47:10.760]  global entity, or this universal entity, this universal consciousness. And it all ties in
[47:10.760 --> 47:13.960]  with the Age of Aquarius people and the New Age people, we're all going to have some kind
[47:13.960 --> 47:18.720]  of enlightenment, there's going to be some event, and we're all going to come together.
[47:18.720 --> 47:21.720]  And that sounds really beautiful when you're thinking about, you know, ending war and world
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.000]  peace and such, but it starts sounding really scary when you start talking when you actually
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.720]  look at what the technologists are saying they want to do. And just for people who aren't
[47:29.720 --> 47:35.280]  aware, Ray Kurzweil is now the director of engineering for Google. So these crazy ideas
[47:35.280 --> 47:40.520]  that I'm talking about, even this Peter Cochrane guy, you know, he is the technologist for
[47:40.520 --> 47:47.040]  British Telecom or was for many years. These are not bizarre out there philosophers, you
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.600]  know, it's not David Icke making these statements. And I don't mean to imply he's bizarre, otherwise
[47:52.600 --> 47:56.520]  make your own opinions on that. But, you know, he's more of a thinker of what's the future
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.120]  going to look like. These other guys are technologists with their hands actually on the power to
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.200]  implement it through Google and elsewhere. So Zach, you know, take a look at Google Glass,
[48:06.200 --> 48:09.880]  this idea of a pair of glasses that you're just going to wear that will filter all of
[48:09.880 --> 48:14.880]  your experiences up into the cloud as you experience them. We're already there. You
[48:14.880 --> 48:19.080]  know, it's happening as we go. Hey, listen, I appreciate the call. Thanks for getting
[48:19.080 --> 48:24.480]  me off into some of that futuristic stuff, because it's really relevant. And we all feel
[48:24.480 --> 48:28.560]  it. All right, let's go to Dave listening in Arizona. Hi, Dave.
[48:28.560 --> 48:34.840]  Oh, hi, Catherine. Thank you for having me on. Are you still there? Yeah, thanks. Appreciate
[48:34.840 --> 48:39.280]  the call. Go ahead. Okay. Okay, good. Well, I'm going to hit you with a shocker. And then
[48:39.280 --> 48:46.200]  I'm going to tell you the solution. The shocker is, I believe, the mark of the beast has already
[48:46.200 --> 48:51.500]  implemented it. And, for example, I'm going to ask you a question here. Do you know the
[48:51.500 --> 48:58.480]  four ways that we can be marked in order that we will have to be able to buy and sell? Well,
[48:58.480 --> 49:02.480]  there's one I'm going to I'm going to jump in here before you get into that and tell
[49:02.480 --> 49:07.160]  you that there is one key component of the mark of the beast, which is a worship component,
[49:07.160 --> 49:11.520]  that when you read and let me tell everybody where it is the last book of the Bible revelation,
[49:11.520 --> 49:16.060]  you can remember the unlucky number 13. So it's in chapter 13. It's the last three verses
[49:16.060 --> 49:21.560]  in chapter 13. So go to the end of the Bible and then go to the end of chapter 13. And
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.720]  it talks about a time when all people great and small, rich and poor, free and bond or
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.960]  imprisoned or enslaved will be caused to have a number on their right hand or their forehead,
[49:30.960 --> 49:34.760]  without which they cannot buy and sell. And then in order to receive that they will have
[49:34.760 --> 49:39.680]  to worship the beast or his image. So Dave, I know lots of people call contact me and
[49:39.680 --> 49:42.800]  they say, well, it's Sunday worship. That's the seven day Adventist. Lots of people say,
[49:42.800 --> 49:46.800]  well, it's you know, being Catholic or whatever, there's a million different explanations.
[49:46.800 --> 49:51.560]  But I would have to ask you whatever it is that you're taking a number to do. It's not
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.220]  involving worship, at least not yet. I don't know anybody bowing the knee and making a
[49:56.220 --> 49:58.880]  prayer before receiving these numbers. Would you agree?
[49:58.880 --> 50:04.280]  Okay, well, okay, let me finish this now. Okay, if you go to Deuteronomy, the Lord asked
[50:04.280 --> 50:10.040]  his people to put his commandments in their frontlets, which is between the eyes, it's
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.480]  in the pineal gland. And he also said, bear them as a sign upon mine hand. What that means
[50:15.480 --> 50:23.120]  is, we know the Ten Commandments, right? And we do the Ten Commandments, so that people
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.360]  can see us following the Ten Commandments when, when we when we do something that would
[50:29.360 --> 50:30.360]  that we obey God.
[50:30.360 --> 50:33.680]  I'm trying to check this in. And we're about to come up on a break here in just a second.
[50:33.680 --> 50:36.480]  So I wanted to give you a chance. How does this tie in with the mark?
[50:36.480 --> 50:40.920]  I would love Okay, the mark of the beast is we also have to have the name or the number.
[50:40.920 --> 50:46.920]  Okay, do you say that you are a US citizen on your taxes? No worship there, Dave. That's
[50:46.920 --> 50:51.440]  that's where Well, I'll tell you what, drop me an email KMA at spy chips calm. I'd love
[50:51.440 --> 50:54.520]  to talk to you further about this. Drop me an email. That's the best way to reach me

[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:39.840]  here with you. Alex is out, I don't know, wrestling wild boars with pen knives, shooting
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.840]  off his.50 caliber rifle. I don't know how he's blowing off steam, but I'm glad he's
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.840]  getting a little bit of a break. He will be back with you again first thing Monday morning,
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  leading the resistance yet again. Tan rested and ready. He is in great shape, reporting
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.840]  in, saying he's having a blast out there doing whatever it is he's doing while we hold the
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.840]  fort down for his return. All right, we do have a full bank of phone calls, and before
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.840]  we get into our topic of this hour, I do want to see if we can bring just a couple of them
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.840]  up. Callers, do me a favor and see if you can get to your point quickly. Let's go to
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.840]  Chris listening in New Mexico. Hey, Chris.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840]  Hello, Catherine.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840]  Hi there. What's on your mind?
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.840]  Yes. Yeah, I just wanted to hopefully attempt to dispel a persistent myth in reference to
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.840]  the 2 billion rounds of ammunition purchased by DHS.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]  All right.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:34.840]  While it is, of course, concerning that they purchased that quantity, I wanted to just
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.840]  basically explain that from since before September 11, DHS, as well as what was previously INS
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  and some other agencies, do indeed use hollow point rounds for target practice.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.840]  Is this where they're shooting at the kids and the grandmas in the target practice?
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.840]  Yeah, I think that's for a recent thing.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.840]  That was a little creepy. Yeah.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.840]  Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this, Chris, and I don't know if you work for DHS
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.840]  or where you have this information, but what is it that DHS needs to be shooting at?
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.840]  I ask you what if they're out there doing target practice with hollow point bullets?
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.840]  First of all, those those suckers are not things you would ever want to aim at a human being
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.840]  unless you were really up against a pretty hardcore enemy.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.840]  What are they looking at? Billions?
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.840]  This is enough ammunition to kill every single one of us in America multiple times over.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.840]  You can't even shoot that much ammo at a target.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.840]  So who's the enemy that they're going to need to shoot with this stuff?
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.840]  Correct. Yeah, like I said, it is it is most definitely a concern of the quantity that they're purchasing.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.840]  But in most law enforcement circles, as law enforcement officers will explain,
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.840]  hollow point rounds are designed to not go through the target and hit a second innocent bystander.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.840]  They're designed to break up and flower out into the target.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.840]  That is why they don't allow agents to use the full metal jacket target rounds
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.840]  because they're afraid that upon leaving the range, and I'm sure it had happened before,
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.840]  before they change its policy.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.840]  Like I said, it's been over 13 years now that going home on your way home
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.840]  or maybe later on in the future get into an incident and you forget to have switched out your rounds
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.840]  for the hollow point, you get into a situation, you end up firing those full metal jackets
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.840]  and they go through the person you're shooting and, you know, kill the person behind them.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.840]  My gosh, though, you know, you take a look at what happened in Tiananmen Square
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.840]  because that's the last time I'm aware of hollow point bullets being used against civilians
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:36.840]  and the Chinese military actually shot their own, you know, perfectly peaceful protesters
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.840]  in the back with hollow point bullets.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.840]  You can actually do a star page search on it and see photographs of what a human body looks like
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.840]  when it's been blasted with a hollow point bullet.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.840]  So I'm not a big fan of people walking around with those things in the chamber.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.840]  I just, you know, the whole concept of that is a little bit mortifying.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.840]  And I won't even say a little bit, we've got now the CIA chief, we've got the attorney general
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:05.840]  really struggling to even make the point that our own military is not allowed to just kill us in cold blood
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.840]  without any kind of due process in our own country.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:14.840]  So thank you for the insight there, but I got to tell you, I just find the whole thing super creepy.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.840]  All right, let's see, we got, I want to apologize to Ryan, Dan and Scarfi.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.840]  It looks like we're probably not going to get to all of these phone calls just because we're coming up on a break here.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.840]  This is the very short segment as we go into the second hour of the program.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.840]  I want to let you know that my guest this hour is going to be John Saleen.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.840]  We're going to be talking about complementary treatments that can help you get through cancer treatment
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.840]  and more, boost your immune system, keep you healthy.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.840]  And believe me, I know of what I speak because I've been down that road before.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840]  All right, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.840]  I'm your host, guest host, Catherine Albrecht.

[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.840]  Hey, it is Friday, folks. Heading into a weekend. Can't wait.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.840]  Yeah, it's been a long week. Lots of stuff going on this week.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.840]  Lots of stuff going on. I don't know, just kind of swirling all around you, isn't it?
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.840]  You blink and 50 stories go right on past you.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.840]  Yeah, the big news, well, we've got so much big news.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.840]  My hat is off this week to Rand Paul.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.840]  You know, a good old-fashioned filibuster.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.840]  What do you get up there and talk 13 hours about drones?
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]  It's about time.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.840]  Do you even think that that hearing would have had,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.840]  do you think any of the mainstream media would have even covered the issue
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.840]  of drones being able to kill people on American soil,
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.840]  kill American citizens without due process if it hadn't been for him standing up and doing that?
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.840]  You know, I know a lot of folks, myself included,
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.840]  have given Rand Paul a really hard time because he's not Ron Paul.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.840]  But I will say, you know, hats off, well done.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.840]  So on my show, I do good news Friday, every Friday.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.840]  That's one of the things I'm going to be talking about this afternoon on my show.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.840]  By the way, my website, if you want to check out my radio show, is kmashow.com.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.840]  All right, well, let me give you just a little bit of background about this hour's guest.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.840]  Joining me this hour, John Salene, he is an expert on mushrooms,
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  and they're used for medicinal purposes.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.840]  And I've taken a lot of flack over the last couple of years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.840]  for doing the conventional treatment and also for doing complementary treatment.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.840]  Let me explain what I mean.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:00.840]  When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I found a lump in my breast the size of a chicken's egg.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.840]  Literally, like, you know, you open up the dozen eggs, that's how big this lump was.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840]  Don't ask me how I didn't find it before.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840]  I could kick myself a thousand times over that I didn't.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.840]  But I'd never had a mammogram, wasn't old enough to qualify for the average screening.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.840]  And by the time I found it, it was a big moment of, holy cow.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.840]  Now, I've always been Ms. Alternative, Ms. Natural.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840]  I do not eat hydrogenated anything.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.840]  I avoid soy and everything GMO.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.840]  I am about as clean of an eater and as clean of a liver.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.840]  I probably have a clean liver too, but I live well.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.840]  And really try to avoid all things processed and all things nasty.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840]  Nevertheless, I develop breast cancer.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.840]  And I've got some family history.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.840]  My aunt unfortunately passed away from it.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.840]  My mother's aunt and possibly my mother's grandmother also passed away from breast cancer.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.840]  So I was probably in the crosshairs without even realizing it.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:59.840]  But when I developed breast cancer, the question I had to ask myself is, okay, now what?
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.840]  And it's the question everybody, one in three of us, by the way, is going to get cancer.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:09.840]  So if you're fortunate enough not to have experienced this, I absolutely pray that you never do.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.840]  But I'm betting that you either know somebody or will know somebody who's going to go down this road
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  because one in three of us is getting it.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  One in eight women is getting breast cancer nowadays.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  So as I had to make the decision, what am I going to do, basically I had competing things from both sides.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.840]  I live and work in this alternative media world myself.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.840]  And I'd always heard, well, don't cut, burn and poison the cancer.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.840]  You've got to instead do all these natural things to build yourself up.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.840]  Long story short, I took a month and I lived about as clean as a human being can live.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.840]  I lived on raw, natural, organic juices, celery juice and carrot juice.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840]  We bought a juicer.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.840]  I did hypnosis.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840]  I did prayer.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840]  I meditated.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840]  I did relaxation.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.840]  I did massages.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.840]  I did every possible thing a human being can possibly do.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.840]  I took every supplement that's known to reduce cancer.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:04.840]  And then I paid $700 to go back in and have this huge tumor reevaluated to see if it had shrunk.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.840]  Well, not only had it not shrunk, it may have even grown a little bit.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.840]  And it was at that point I said, you know what, I can't mess around with this
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.840]  because if it hasn't already metastasized, it's right on the edge of doing so because it's huge.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.840]  I've got to get it out.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  So long story short, I did two years of very aggressive conventional therapy.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840]  But now here's where I get all the grief.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840]  Well, you shouldn't have done that.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.840]  You should have alkalized your body or you should have done, you know,
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.840]  fill in the blank alternative natural treatment in Mexico or Tijuana clinic, this and that.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.840]  My aunt did that and she died.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:42.840]  She did all natural, you know, kombucha and garlic and she had this guru
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.840]  and she did what the guru said and it didn't work.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  And in many cases, it doesn't work.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840]  Well, I didn't want to be a statistic.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.840]  And when I looked at my stats, my chances of surviving this cancer without conventional treatment
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.840]  were less than 1%.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.840]  It was 0.8% that I would still be alive and kicking in 10 years.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.840]  All right, those statistics got my attention.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.840]  And if there's one thing I know how to do, it's research.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.840]  Just to write the book Spy Chips, our expose on RFID, my co-author Liz and I,
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.840]  we went through 30,000 documents to write that book, Spy Chips.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.840]  By the way, if you haven't read it, get a copy out of your library and sit down with it
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.840]  because it's stuff you need to know.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.840]  But if I could read 30,000 documents to write a book on RFID,
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.840]  you better believe I could sit down and read way more than that in order to save my own life.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.840]  So I did.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.840]  And what I came up with is a new way or a different way of navigating this whole cancer experience,
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.840]  which is taking the best of both worlds.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.840]  So at the same time, I'm getting flack from all my listeners.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.840]  Catherine, how could you possibly do chemo?
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.840]  At the same time I was getting that, my oncologist was giving me grief
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.840]  because I was complimentary, I was adding in all of the resveratrol and the curcumin
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:01.840]  and the Hawthorne for heart function and acetylcholine for neuropathy and you name it.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:08.840]  So I take between 30 and 40 pills a day of complimentary herbs and other supplements
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.840]  in order to make sure that I never see this beast again.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.840]  Now, both sides are at war.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.840]  The conventional oncologist wants nothing to do with all of my herbal supplements
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.840]  and all the alternative people want nothing to do with all the information
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.840]  that I've gleaned about radiation and chemotherapy.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.840]  And I believe that we need to have a better merging of those two.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:32.840]  All right, well, joining me this hour is John Saline of Mushroom Science.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:38.840]  He is, when my husband was trying to figure out why my white blood cell counts were dropping so low after chemo,
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:44.840]  my wonderful husband went online and did some research and he discovered that over in Japan,
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:50.840]  they have taken a purified form of Coriolis mushroom, they have purified it
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.840]  and extracted it into something that they literally hang in the chemo center in an IV bag
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.840]  and administer to patients to keep their white blood cell count from dropping.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.840]  And that is how I wound up discovering the whole thing about mushrooms and discovering John Saline.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.840]  And with no further ado, let me go ahead and welcome John Saline to the program.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840]  Hello, John.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]  Hi, Catherine. How are you doing?
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.840]  Hey, it is great to have you here with me.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.840]  So I know that was kind of a lengthy introduction here, but I got to tell you,
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.840]  ever since I found the Coriolis when I was going through this more treatment than my oncologist has ever given to anyone,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.840]  she told me, is I was going through that.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.840]  One of the key problems that you have when you do the conventional therapy, it's hard on the body.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.840]  And one of the ways it's hard is the white blood cell count.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.840]  So talk to us about what they've discovered over in Japan with the PSK.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  Well, Japan's medical system is really different than ours.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.840]  They have a long tradition of herbal medicine, and China, Japan, Korea,
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  they have allowed their herbal medicine to co-evolve with the advent of allopathic or modern medicine,
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.840]  surgery and pharmaceuticals, you know, that kind of approach.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:15.840]  And, boy, it was back in the 60s when a chemist for Korea incorporated a pharmaceutical company.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.840]  His neighbor was basically sent home to die.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.840]  He had stomach cancer, and they said,
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.840]  well, we've done what we can do, though, get your affairs in order.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.840]  So this guy, his neighbor was running all over the neighborhood,
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.840]  picking a certain mushroom and making tea out of it and drinking it.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.840]  Lo and behold, he got better.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:43.840]  So the chemist, you know, it took a while, but convinced his boss,
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.840]  the people above him, like, hey, we need to take a look at this.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.840]  And, well, they started researching it and researching other mushrooms as well,
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.840]  what they referred to as medicinal or tonic, that delivered tonic benefits
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.840]  as defined in Chinese and Japanese herbals.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:10.840]  And they found that these mushrooms have polysaccharides in their cell walls,
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.840]  and these polysaccharides contain beta-glucans.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:21.840]  And they can't, because your white blood cells are basically your cellular immune system.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:28.840]  Right, so the white blood cells are the immune cells that come out and attack the foreign invaders.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:37.840]  And in the case of cancer, right, against pathogens, viruses and bacteria,
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.840]  but also against cancer cells as well.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.840]  Well, what it is, I mean, you know, it's always important to have a healthy immune system.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.840]  Absolutely.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.840]  More so than when you're dealing with a serious issue like you are.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.840]  And we have immune cells.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840]  They don't really know why.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.840]  I mean, they know how it works.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.840]  That's not exactly why it works.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:09.840]  We have immune cells that are hardwired to respond to these beta-glucans.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.840]  And this is what I find so interesting, that the reason the mushrooms work,
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.840]  and it took me a while to really understand all of this with your help,
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:23.840]  is that when you eat the hot water extract of these mushrooms, the polysaccharides,
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.840]  which are little molecules and the beta-glucans inside of there,
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.840]  they have a particular shape, if I have this understood correctly.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.840]  Yes, basically a physical trigger.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.840]  What they're called is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.840]  Now, that sounds kind of spooky, but, you know,
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.840]  your nonspecific immune response has to very quickly,
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.840]  it casts a wide net and has to very quickly look at something.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840]  Does that belong here?
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840]  Yes or no?
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  Is it a threat?
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840]  Yes or no?
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.840]  And then respond accordingly.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.840]  So just to summarize this, when you take in one of these beta-glucans,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  one of the polysaccharides or the little natural sugars that occur in these mushrooms,
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.840]  the body says, holy cow, this is a pathogen.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.840]  It looks like a pathogen because of the shape of it.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.840]  So the immune cells then get stimulated.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.840]  They start pouring out of the bone marrow and try to attack these little mushroom cells.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.840]  But when they get there, they take a look and go, wait a minute, this isn't a pathogen.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.840]  This is just a piece of food.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:31.840]  And now that we're here, now that we've created this huge army, what else can we attack?
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:41.840]  The whole key is that the response created is effective against all pathogens.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.840]  Well, that's the thing I personally experienced.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.840]  I want to let listeners know exactly how this benefits cancer patients
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.840]  going through chemotherapy when we come back.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.840]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  I'm your host, Catherine Albrecht,

[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.840]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:05.840]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.840]  if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.840]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall,
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.840]  so, too, your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:21.840]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:25.840]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.840]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids and all whey protein powders
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.840]  we've investigated and most proteins you consume are heated.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.840]  With our true cool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.840]  My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.840]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.840]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.840]  This is my ideal weight.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.840]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts,
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840]  and an increase in my potency.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.840]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:03.840]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have.

[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.840]  fungus, bacteria, and much more.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840]  Cells Alive Silver Solution has no expiration date,
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.840]  is great for emergency kits and storage shelters,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.840]  and comes in 8- or 16-ounce bottles.

[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric,
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.840]  engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.840]  then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest,
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]  forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.840]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.840]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.840]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.840]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.840]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.840]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.840]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.840]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun,
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.840]  but the correct answer will shock you.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.840]  I just created a free video at crisis123.com
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:18.840]  that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.840]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.840]  In fact, I haven't even given it a thought.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.840]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.840]  and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.840]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.840]  Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840]  You'll be shocked.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.840]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:55.840]  Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:11.840]  Again, that's crisis123.com.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:38.840]  Think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.840]  But your thoughts will soon be wanted, the way they always do.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:51.840]  When you're riding 16 hours, there's nothing much to do.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.840]  And you don't feel much like riding.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.840]  You just wish the truth was true.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]  Hey, we're back.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.840]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.840]  Catherine Alberts here riding shotgun with you till the end of the day.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:16.840]  It is Good News Friday and we're talking this hour about an inexpensive alternative to those $3,000 new Lasta shots
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:17.840]  or Neupogen shots.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.840]  If you know what I'm talking about,
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.840]  anybody out there, I certainly went through this.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.840]  When they give you chemotherapy, let me just give you the background as to why this is so important.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.840]  When they give you chemo, the chemo works by destroying fast dividing cells.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.840]  And cancer cells, the reason they are cancer cells is because they're multiplying and dividing rapidly out of control.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:46.840]  So what the chemo does is it goes in and it makes that cell division process not work.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.840]  So any cells that are in the process of dividing as the chemo goes through the body,
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.840]  the couple of hours that it's active, those cells will die.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840]  That's why women lose their hair.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.840]  It's one of the reasons why you have the nausea and some of the side effects of chemotherapy,
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.840]  which they've gotten really good at mitigating, by the way.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.840]  But that's how chemotherapy destroys cancerous tumors because they are fast replicating.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840]  That's how you get a tumor.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:15.840]  It's something that's grow, grow, grow, grow, grow until it's big enough to be some huge lump that then takes out your bodily function.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  So in this process, unfortunately, one of the sets of cells that is continually dividing are your white blood cells inside of your bone marrow.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:31.840]  And as they're dividing to create your immune system, then the chemo goes in and blasts them out.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.840]  And so one of the side effects of chemotherapy is a drop in your white blood cell count.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.840]  It's called neutropenia.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.840]  And so every time that I would have a chemotherapy treatment, which I believe absolutely saved my life,
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:48.840]  every time I would have that life-saving treatment, the downside would be my immune function would drop through the floor.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:55.840]  I wound up with colds and flus and infections and strap infections bursting out of my skin.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.840]  It was a nightmare because every pathogen that came down the pike, I was susceptible to it because I didn't have the white blood cells.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:10.840]  So what they do at the chemo center is they send you in for a $3,000 shot called either Neulasto or Neupogen.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:18.840]  This $3,000 shot, you have to go in 72 hours or 48, 72 hours after your chemo treatment.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.840]  They give you this $3,000 shot.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.840]  And by the way, not all women's insurance will even cover this.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.840]  When they give you the shot, it's super painful going in.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.840]  And then you have to take pain pills because it forces the bone marrow to produce the white blood cells.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840]  It's extremely painful.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.840]  It's like the worst cramps you can ever imagine in your arm, especially in your legs.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.840]  That's where you've got the long bone marrow.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.840]  So that is the standard way that we do it here in the U.S.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.840]  It's costing a fortune.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.840]  Take every patient who's receiving chemotherapy, multiply it out by four or eight treatments,
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.840]  and then multiply that out by all of the people who have cancer,
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.840]  and you can only imagine the amount of money being spent on this.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.840]  Well, in Japan, as we were discussing with John Saline of Mushroom Science, in Japan they don't do that.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.840]  They give people right in the chemo center, in the IV bag, something called PSK.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.840]  That's P as in Peter, S as in Sam, K as in Catherine.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.840]  PSK, which is nothing more than a purified extract of Coriolis mushroom.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.840]  It's got the polysaccharides that we're talking about.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.840]  It's got the shape that triggers the immune system naturally on its own to stimulate those cells
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.840]  to begin pouring out of the bone marrow and then go after what it needs to go after.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.840]  Long story short, in my case, I did the new last two shots for the first couple of times,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.840]  and in several cases it wasn't even working.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:41.840]  It wasn't bringing my blood cell count up to where it needed to be.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:42.840]  My husband went online.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.840]  He discovered that there's only one company on the planet, essentially, that makes the right form of this,
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.840]  the hot water extract.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.840]  That company is called Mushroom Science.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:57.840]  He discovered that the Coriolis mushroom, I'll spell it for you, C-O-R-I-O-L-U-S,
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:04.840]  Coriolis mushroom is the over-the-counter, you-can-just-buy-it-yourself version of PSK.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:05.840]  So he bought it.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.840]  He went to Mushroom Science.
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.840]  I think it's like buy five, get one free, I think, and bought a case of it.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.840]  I started taking it, and sure enough, the next time I went in for my white blood cell count test,
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.840]  which they always do right before your next chemo, it was normal.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:25.840]  Not only not low, but normal, and not at the low end of normal either, right in the center of normal.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:28.840]  And I never again had that neutropenia problem.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:33.840]  So that's what enabled me to get through chemo and to not have to end the life-saving treatment
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.840]  because I was able to support my immune system through the process.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.840]  So you put all that together, it's extraordinary.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.840]  Mushroom Science, and by the way, I blogged about this,
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.840]  and there's a link on my website at kmashow.com if you click on the blog.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.840]  Stay tuned.

[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:07.840]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.840]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:14.840]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:20.840]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarshop.com.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.840]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.840]  We've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.840]  The Ktor Hand Crank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:38.840]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.840]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:45.840]  TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.840]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM-FM radios.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.840]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.840]  And your purchase makes our Infowarshop possible.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:59.840]  We're getting prepared. Are you? Infowarshop.com.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.840]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.840]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:39.840]  You are listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.840]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.840]  Catherine Albrecht filling in for Alex.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.840]  The only thing I know about his undisclosed location, he's out on the coast.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.840]  So I'm not sure if he's fishing or maybe bringing in some shrimp, some snapper.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.840]  I know he's having a great time, though.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.840]  He wanted us to let you all know that, that he's having a wonderful time.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.840]  And he has been checking in periodically through video.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.840]  You know, I keep saying, Alex, take a break.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  Take a break, but you know he won't.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.840]  All right. Well, it is going to be good when he's back in the driver's seat next week,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.840]  piloting the information war that's going on right now.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.840]  I want to remind you that at Infowarshop you can get gear, that's shirts, hats, and more.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:30.840]  You can also save 10% off on a number of products, including, I believe, the Propure water filters.
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.840]  There's some kind of a coupon on there for Propure.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.840]  Check it out because clean water is one of the key things that you can do for your health.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.840]  E-Foods Direct, clearly, we need to be able to continue to feed our families
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.840]  in the event of some kind of FEMA emergency or outage.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.840]  And E-Foods Direct is the place to go for that.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.840]  Yengeviti also, a whole host of health and wellness products available there.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:58.840]  And we're talking this hour about PSK, or the over-the-counter version of this.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.840]  This is Coriolis mushroom.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.840]  Super amazing stuff.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.840]  You know, I'm kind of wearing it on my sleeve, Bible-believing Christian.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  And I have to say, God has provided just about every possible thing we could need on this planet.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840]  It's just a question of figuring out what it all is.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.840]  And the mushrooms, you know, they're out there.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.840]  And they're available.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.840]  And they have this incredible effect on the human body.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:21.840]  And it's positive.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.840]  They stimulate that immune system, which enables you to get through chemotherapy.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:31.840]  Or even if you're not going through chemo, if you're falling prey to every infection that comes down the pike,
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.840]  if during flu season you find that you're continually run down,
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.840]  that you're the only person in the office or in the classroom who winds up getting sick,
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.840]  you can boost your immune system with Coriolis.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  It really does work.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840]  And I'm living proof.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.840]  See, most people, you kind of have to take it on faith.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:51.840]  But I have the actual blood test results of when I was taking it and when I wasn't taking it.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.840]  And it essentially saved me because it enabled me to get through all of my chemotherapy treatments
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.840]  without having this awful drop in white blood cell count.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.840]  I want to get back to John-Celine here in a moment.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.840]  I also want to let you know that if you are a cancer patient
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.840]  or if you know a cancer patient who's going through this process,
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840]  everybody always contacts me, how do I get it?
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.840]  How do I get it?
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.840]  I have linked it on my website, on my blog, actually, at KMAShow,
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  or just my name, Catherine Albrecht.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.840]  Or you can go straight to mushroomscience.com.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.840]  And if you use the coupon code Catherine, which is, I believe it's built into my site at KMAShow.com,
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  if you click the link of the Mushroom Science Coriolis box,
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:35.840]  but you can also just type it in, K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.840]  If you use the coupon code with a purchase, only if you make a purchase,
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.840]  you will actually, I think, John, you're sending people a book?
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.840]  Do you have a mushroom book that you're sending out?
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.840]  Yeah, a free book by Dr. Mark Stengler.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.840]  It's The Health Benefits of Medicinal Mushrooms.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840]  Very good book.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.840]  So let's, and I want to get into that.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.840]  Let me open up the phone lines, and then I want to get into some of the other health benefits
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.840]  because for me it's been really Coriolis and Maitake.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.840]  And I take the Maitake every day because of a lot of the research out there showing
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.840]  that it's just a good thing for cancer survivors to be on anyway.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.840]  So you're kind of my expert.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.840]  I've been kind of sitting at your feet here for the last couple of years learning about this.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.840]  Phone lines 1-800-259-9231.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.840]  And John, give us a sense.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.840]  So when you talk about this book that people get free with a purchase,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  what is the information in the book that people need to know?
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.840]  What are some of the high points of the medicinal impact of mushrooms?
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.840]  Probably one of the most important points that Dr. Stengler makes
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:40.840]  is how to choose a properly manufactured mushroom supplement.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:48.840]  Unfortunately in the U.S., a vast majority of the mushroom supplements on the market
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:53.840]  are not extracted and they're just not good at work.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:02.840]  So he teaches you what to look for on the label, which is really quite simple but very essential.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:08.840]  He gives you examples, literal examples of what you want to see on the supplement facts.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:13.840]  That's the one part of the bottle every company must, by law, tell the truth.
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.840]  And the key here is hot water extract, is that correct?
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.840]  That's the key that makes your product different.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.840]  Yeah, or just the word extracted.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.840]  And you want to see the percentage of polysaccharides.
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.840]  We've known how to test for polysaccharides for half a century,
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.840]  how to measure them, quantify them, test for them.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:40.840]  At our company we have our own lab where we have all the analytical chemistry tools to do that.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.840]  And there's no good reason to leave that information off the label.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.840]  I mean, you have to know it to control your manufacturing process.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.840]  So every company should know the percentage of polysaccharides in their product.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  If they're not telling you the percentage, it's not an extract and it's not something you want to use.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.840]  Well, and let me get into that because one of the questions people ask is,
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.840]  well, hang on a second, can I just buy this and eat it?
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:15.840]  And the answer is you're probably not going to find Coriolis out there in your local Whole Foods.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.840]  It's the texture of wood.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:19.840]  I mean, I suppose if you put it in the crock pot for a couple of weeks,
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.840]  you might get it down to a point where you could chew it.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:31.840]  But we're using 20 to 25 kilos of dried mushrooms to concentrate down to one kilo of a dehydrated extract.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:38.840]  So, I mean, our extraction facility is basically a giant teapot, but at the end of the line,
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.840]  we convert it to a powder.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.840]  Too expensive to sell as a liquid.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  There is one good liquid mushroom supplement on the market, which we sell at our website, Maitake Gold.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.840]  That's the one I take.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.840]  Yeah, that is the one that I take.
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.840]  Well, let me explain this because I'm actually a member of the Mycological Society of Boston,
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.840]  so I'm a long-time mushroomer.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  My husband and I have studied mushrooms for years,
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.840]  and I never realized that they'd be one of the things saving my life.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  But the thing people need to understand about mushrooms is that the fruit of the mushroom,
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.840]  the thing that you actually eat or make a tea out of or that you see growing above the ground,
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.840]  is just a visible fruit, almost like the apples on a tree,
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.840]  that underneath there, the real mushroom organism is the mycelium.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  It's the thready, it's like these long, thin threads,
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:31.840]  and that's really the organism that lives year-round and lives under the ground
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.840]  and pops up periodically, these fruits.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.840]  So you can pick all the mushrooms you want and not kill the mushroom plant, quote, unquote,
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.840]  or the mushroom mycelium without killing the fungus.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.840]  But the problem with some of the other products out there,
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.840]  and I know on Coast to Coast recently there was a guy on talking about Coriolis,
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:52.840]  and you and I were both cringing because a lot of these Coriolis supplements,
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.840]  I know that mushroom science is the only one that's the hot water extract,
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.840]  but some of these other supplements don't even give you the mushroom,
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:02.840]  they give you the mycelial mass, which does not contain the polysaccharides.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.840]  So how can they get away with claiming that?
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.840]  The mycelium does contain the polysaccharides,
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:16.840]  but those products, when they grow the mycelium on rice, number one, it's still 65% rice.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.840]  So only a third of the product roughly is mycelium.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.840]  But if it's not extracted, the cell walls are made of kite,
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:26.840]  and that thing is a lobster shell, but you know how tough those are.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.840]  Our body can't break it down, you know.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:36.840]  And universally, every traditional herbal practice that has used mushrooms medicinally,
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.840]  when they want the medicine, they throw it at the teapot.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.840]  Every study ever published, including all the data on PSK,
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.840]  also hot water extracted for that very reason.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.840]  It's not that often that you get absolute consensus
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:55.840]  between thousands of years of herbal practice
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.840]  and every scientific study ever done on a particular subject.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.840]  But here you have it.
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.840]  Right, so, and this is the research that my husband did.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.840]  He's also the wonderful genius who found the tetra thioma lib-date trial,
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.840]  the Cornell trial that I just began,
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:14.840]  that's doing copper depletion to prevent a recurrence.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.840]  So both of these things I have to say I owe to my husband
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.840]  because he went out there and did the hardcore research,
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.840]  especially the mushrooms, because I was a little bit too worn down.
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.840]  Because of the low white blood cell count and all the infections I was getting,
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.840]  I was in no position to even research.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.840]  So he went out there and said, Coriolis mushroom,
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.840]  but the problem is where do we get the right kind
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.840]  that actually matches the PSK out of Japan?
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.840]  We can't order PSK.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.840]  My chemo center wasn't going to put it in an IV bag.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.840]  And then when he found you and found mushroom science,
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.840]  it was like thank goodness that there is a supplier
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.840]  that's actually making that version available for the public to purchase.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:49.840]  So it's awesome stuff.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840]  It's called Coriolis mushroom.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  And you've got a couple of different kinds on the website.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.840]  I have a link if people want to go directly to the one I take.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.840]  I still take it every day.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.840]  I will continue to take it every day of my life.
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.840]  And if you want to know the one I'm taking,
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.840]  it already includes the coupon code as well.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.840]  It's at kmashow.com.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.840]  And then just click on the blue link on the right that says blog.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.840]  You'll see a picture of the Coriolis box itself.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.840]  And when you click it, it'll take you directly to the mushroom science website
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:20.840]  where you can get a free book if you place an order.
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  All right, let's go to the phone lines.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.840]  We've got Tom holding in West Virginia.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.840]  Hi, Tom.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.840]  You're on with John Selene and Catherine Albrecht.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.840]  Go right ahead.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:28.840]  Hi, John and Catherine.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:34.840]  I was wondering, John, if you'd heard of Corbyacin from the 50s and 60s?
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.840]  No, I have not.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:42.840]  Okay, well, that's the same principle that was researched in the 50s.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:48.840]  It's based on Acrimyces bogus, which is a fungal fungus.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:56.840]  And it was found to actually be a very strong attacker of cancer,
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.840]  all forms of cancer.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:04.840]  But the FDA banned it in 1964 after a 13-year controversy that was, you know,
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.840]  was pretty big in the country.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:15.840]  The discoverer was a mycologist who studied at the Louis Pasteur Institute.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.840]  And he discovered it.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:23.840]  Basically, he had the idea that, you know,
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:27.840]  horses sometimes get this tumor on their throat.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:39.840]  And so he realized that sometimes the horse will survive,
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.840]  but most of the time they'll die, you know, from the tumor.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  It's a very, very fast-growing tumor.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.840]  And it's called lumpy jaw.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:54.840]  And so he, well, the discoverer, his name was Stevan Jarovic,
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:05.840]  he discovered this crevice in 1951, which was a, basically he...
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.840]  Well, let me hand this question back to John.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.840]  John, in terms of the mushrooms,
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.840]  I know that at Mushroom Science you've got a whole variety of different mushrooms
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.840]  that have been shown in all kinds of clinical testing
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.840]  to be good for a whole variety of different conditions.
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:23.840]  As far as the FDA goes, what does the FDA have to say about mushroom supplements?
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.840]  I think Tom raises an interesting point.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.840]  Well, they're classified as dietary supplements.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:33.840]  And they wanted to regulate dietary supplements as drugs.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:41.840]  There are a lot of very unhappy people on all sides of all political spectrums.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:48.840]  So Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah and Senator Harkin from Iowa got together
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:54.840]  and passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994,
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:58.840]  which said the FDA has to regulate them as food
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:04.840]  and then come up with a set of rules for good manufacturing practices, particularly...
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:07.840]  So are they still working on that? Have they come up with those?
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:13.840]  Actually, the FDA was so angry that they couldn't regulate the supplements as drugs.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:16.840]  They ignored the law for years.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:22.840]  And then finally in 2008, which was 14 years later,
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.840]  they started coming out with the rules.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:32.840]  And then 2008 it was for the really big companies, 200 and over.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:38.840]  2009, companies between 220 employees to 200 employees.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.840]  And then 2010, companies of 20 employees or less.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.840]  Those rules apply.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.840]  And it's not a bad thing to have standard operating procedures
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.840]  and to keep the kind of paperwork that allows the FDA,
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:58.840]  regardless of what you think about them,
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:03.840]  the reason they came into being was a lot of issues with the safety of food.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.840]  You know, it's interesting.
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:07.840]  I was just on the Memorial Sloan Kettering website,
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.840]  which has just a great resource of all the alternative treatments
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:13.840]  and natural treatments and supplements and everything else.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.840]  And I strongly encourage people to check those out.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:21.840]  Coriolis, by the way, is on there and very highly regarded by Memorial Sloan Kettering.
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:23.840]  So they've got all the links to the research and everything else.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.840]  But what I thought was very interesting is they talked about contamination.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.840]  Like there was one acai berry that was contaminated by the tryptosomes,
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.840]  I think, or whatever the word is, of these parasites.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:38.840]  And things like that, clearly you don't want to be taking acai berry supplements
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:41.840]  that are going to give you some parasitic disease.
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.840]  You know, there is a rule for that, but I think...
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.840]  You have to be careful.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:47.840]  They're food products, which means they can harbor pathogens.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  And I think one of the other ones, they were talking about kombucha
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.840]  that was brewed in something that had been glazed in lead,
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.840]  and people got lead poisoning.
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.840]  So, you know, yeah, there are certain issues,
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  but I think we all are in agreement that we don't want the FDA to say,
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840]  no, you can't eat a mushroom any longer.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.840]  Exactly.
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.840]  Hey, Tom, let me thank Tom for the phone call.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.840]  Let's see if we can squeeze in another one before the break.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.840]  Let's go to, let's see, Jack listening in Illinois.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:11.840]  Hi, Jack.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.840]  You're on with John Selene.
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:15.840]  Is Jack with us?
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.840]  Hello?
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.840]  Hi, Jack.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.840]  Hello?
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:19.840]  Yeah, go right ahead.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.840]  Yes, we love you, we love you, we love you.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.840]  But you speak too fast for us to write what we need to write down,
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.840]  and we need a phone number to try to reach this product.
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:28.840]  We're of Amish background.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.840]  All right.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.840]  John, can you give us a phone number where people can call?
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  And the coupon code is Catherine, so that will get you the book.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.840]  And what's the phone number where people can call, John?
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.840]  Well, first I will tell them is there is a toll-free number.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.840]  It's 888-330.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.840]  Oh, boy, I'm not sure.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840]  I'm going to give you the one I know for sure.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:52.840]  Okay.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  Code 541.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:54.840]  Uh-huh.
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.840]  541-344-1396.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.840]  All right.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.840]  And they can give you the toll-free number.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.840]  We'll grab it and give it to you.
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.840]  Thank you, people, that I'm the only one there that answers technical questions,
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:16.840]  and I will not be in the office, back in the office, until Tuesday of next week, Tuesday afternoon.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.840]  But Shannon's there.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.840]  Shannon is wonderful.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:25.840]  And the last time I talked about this on Coast to Coast, poor Shannon was absolutely swamped
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.840]  and asked me to tell the listeners that if you do order the supplement,
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.840]  you know, try to get your order in first because the people who ordered towards the end,
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:35.840]  there was a bit of a delay.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840]  I think you guys had to order in more products.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.840]  So it could be, what, up to a week or so or even two or three weeks before you actually get it.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  Yeah, that last one generated thousands of orders, and that's more than we normally process in a day.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.840]  And so, you know, it could take three to four days.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.840]  It works better prepared this time.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:01.840]  So you can go to my website, kmashow.com,
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.840]  and then on the right-hand side, there is a blog link, the blue link.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.840]  And actually, I think it's right on my home page.
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  It's actually right at kmashow.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.840]  It's on the right-hand side.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:12.840]  You'll see a box of the Coriolis mushroom that I take every day.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:17.840]  And you can also just go directly to mushroomscience.com,
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:23.840]  and the product is called Coriolis, C-O-R-I-O-L-U-S, Coriolis mushroom.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.840]  Coriolis is super strength.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  The super strength one is the one that I take.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.840]  We can't use the word PSK because it's trademarked.
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.840]  Right.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.840]  There's lots of aspirin, but only they are called.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  Coriolis is super strength.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:38.840]  And, yes, and take it on an empty stomach,
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.840]  because I didn't realize I was supposed to be doing that until recently.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  So I take it in the morning on an empty stomach and then between meals,
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.840]  because that way the polysaccharides, you know, distribute through the body and stimulate the immune system.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.840]  All right, stay tuned. We'll be back and try to get the rest of your calls right after this.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:00.840]  Music
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.840]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.840]  But if you don't have a home security system,
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.840]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:13.840]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:04.840]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.840]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets,
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:14.840]  but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:20.840]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:26.840]  and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:31.840]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.

[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.840]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:54:19.840]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:26.840]  So it's like Start Page. While you have the ability to take advantage of alternatives, do it.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.840]  They want to take it all the way. They want to take away your alternatives on the Internet.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.840]  They want to take away your alternatives through the media.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.840]  Believe me, they would love to shut down the Alex Jones show.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:41.840]  I'm sure there are plots afoot right now to try to find a way to do it,
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.840]  but we've got this tricky little thing called the First Amendment that stands in the way of them doing that.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:52.840]  And as far as your alternatives for health, I'm a big believer in evidence.
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.840]  So I actually got some email on my show yesterday.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:55:00.840]  I was railing against some of these charlatans with bogus cancer cures that don't do anything,
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:06.840]  that have absolutely no evidence other than a couple of smiling people who they say did great,
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.840]  but there's no scientific evidence.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.840]  And if there's one thing Harvard taught me, it was how to do research.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:18.840]  And you can go on to PubMed.com or PubMed.gov.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.840]  The one we'll redirect to the other.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:28.840]  PubMed is the website repository for all of the peer-reviewed academic medical journal studies.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.840]  Go on there.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.840]  Don't take my word for it or John Selene's word for it.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:36.840]  Go on there and look up Coriolis mushroom at PubMed.com
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:42.840]  and you will see dozens of peer-reviewed scientific medical journal articles on this.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:48.840]  You can look up Coriolis, C-O-R-I-O-L-U-S-P-S-K at PubMed.com
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.840]  and you will see published in journals of oncology, published in journals of biochemistry,
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:56:00.840]  you'll see it place after place that this is actually being shown to have a direct and immediate impact on the immune system.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:01.840]  Powerful stuff.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.840]  The Japanese have figured it out.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.840]  Hopefully at some point here in the U.S. we'll get around this $3,000 new last shot
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:11.840]  that is so painful for women and other cancer patients
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.840]  and actually make the transition to PSK.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.840]  But you don't have to wait for that.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:16.840]  You can do it directly.
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:17.840]  You can do it yourself.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:21.840]  And this is why I say reach out for these alternatives when they're available to you.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:24.840]  Let's see, in response to the call asking about the phone number,
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:28.840]  John, I actually went on your website and let me give the toll-free number.
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:34.840]  It's 888-283-6583.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:35.840]  That's mushroom science.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.840]  I know that you don't have a massive staff over there
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:40.840]  and you're not staffed with 50 people answering the phone,
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:41.840]  so I would encourage people to...
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  Yeah, I would encourage people to wait until Tuesday afternoon to call when I'm there
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  because I can answer the questions.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.840]  Well, that's to answer questions, but if they want to place an order,
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:52.840]  today would probably be the better time to do it while you still have stock
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.840]  because I know that whenever we talk about this, right,
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:58.840]  you run out and then it takes a couple of weeks,
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:00.840]  so if people do want to just call and place an order.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.840]  The other thing you can do, please remember the coupon code, Catherine,
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.840]  and when you go to mushroomscience.com, and let me clarify again,
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:12.840]  you don't want to get the Coriolis elsewhere because it's not hot water extracted.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.840]  It's not PSK.
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:17.840]  So when you go to mushroomscience.com, if you scroll down to the left,
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:19.840]  you'll actually see my picture there, Catherine Albrecht,
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.840]  and if you click it, it says, welcome coast to coast listeners.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:24.840]  We need to update that, welcome Alex Jones listeners.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:30.840]  But if you click that, it will take you to the Coriolis super strength PSK formula page,
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:36.840]  and you can just enter in the coupon code, Catherine, K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E right there.
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:39.840]  All right, so let's see if we can squeeze in another phone call.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:43.840]  We've got, let's see, Ken listening in Indiana.
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840]  Ken, really quickly in our last minute here.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.840]  Go ahead.
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.840]  Catherine, you're such a blessing.
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:51.840]  I just want to tell you that I just want to make it quick here.
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:55.840]  I've always believed that the key to good health is stimulating your immune system.
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:59.840]  I used to put herbs in the children's applesauce when they were younger,
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.840]  and we had very healthy young children.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:06.840]  I guess what I want real quick is I'm a 58-year-old male.
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:11.840]  I'm interested in maintaining good health in my elderly years.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:16.840]  Could you recommend, is there things just for men or just generally that you can recommend?
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  I know in John's book that he covers a lot of that,
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:26.840]  and I'm going to be blogging about that on my website at KMAshow.com.
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:28.840]  In fact, I'm writing a book on this.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.840]  All right, John Selene, yeah, I want to thank you so much.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.840]  We've come to the end of the program.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.840]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.840]  MushroomScience.com is the website to learn more.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.840]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:38.840]  I'm Catherine Albrecht.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.840]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:44.840]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:50.840]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:20.840]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:47.840]  24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:53.840]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:04.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.840]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:12.840]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:16.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:33.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.840]  Welcome to Hour 3 of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:38.840]  Catherine Albrecht filling in for Alex.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:42.840]  He's off at the coast fishing and, as one listener said,
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.840]  wrestling cactuses with his bare hands.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.840]  You know he is, too.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:49.840]  All right, well, he's going to come back with more energy than ever before.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.840]  Look out for the blast furnace hitting us all on Monday as Alex comes back turbocharged.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:55.840]  Can't wait.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.840]  All right, well, I am your host, Catherine Albrecht.
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.840]  As you know, I cover a bunch of stuff.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:07.840]  My last 12, 13 years of my life has been devoted to fighting against implantable microchips.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.840]  RFID incursion and other forms of privacy incursion.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:15.840]  And I'm kind of on a new kick right now because I'm so frustrated
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.840]  with all the misinformation floating out there about cancer.
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.840]  And if one in three of us is going to be diagnosed with this scourge of a disease,
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:27.840]  you know, that's more people than got the black plague back in Europe during the plague years.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.840]  I mean, this thing is coming.
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:31.840]  And it's here.
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:36.840]  And every time I turn around, you know, women in their 30s being stricken with this awful disease.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:38.840]  We really need to be thinking prevention.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.840]  We really need to be thinking treatment.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:46.840]  And we really need to be figuring out how to intelligently navigate the options that we have available.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:51.840]  And I would encourage you not to fall prey to the people who say, oh, yes,
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:57.840]  just take my miracle holy water that I've waved some ions over and it'll cure you of cancer.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:00.840]  Don't go in there to the conventional folks.
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:04.840]  If you get cancer, if you're diagnosed with cancer, at the very least,
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.840]  do yourself one favor, get a professional oncologist opinion.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:13.840]  There is research out there, you can find this again at PubMed,
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  that shows that the people who travel more than 50 miles for their cancer treatment
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.840]  actually have a higher survival rate.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:23.840]  And that's not because travel somehow makes you healthier.
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.840]  It's because traveling means that you've avoided your local podunk hospital
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:31.840]  and you've traveled to a world-class cancer center.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:32.840]  That's what I've done.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.840]  I've got a lovely little hospital right here in Nashua that I could have gone to.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.840]  In fact, that's where I was first diagnosed.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:41.840]  But I take the hour and a half drive into Boston to go to Dana-Farber,
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:44.840]  which is a world-class cancer center.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:47.840]  If I hadn't have done that, I would have gotten different treatment.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.840]  So at least, at the very least, get an opinion from an oncologist,
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:56.840]  sit down and figure out what your options are before you absolutely throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:01.840]  People are living longer than ever with the cancer treatments available conventionally.
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.840]  That doesn't mean it's really good for you.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:06.840]  You've got to really go in tough to knock out the cancer.
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:09.840]  You nurture yourself with the complementary stuff,
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.840]  and that's how you bring your health back,
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:14.840]  and that's also what you can do to survive the treatments,
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:16.840]  like the Coriolis mushroom we were talking about.
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:18.840]  All right, really quickly, let's go to Mark,
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:20.840]  who's been holding in Florida with a question on cancer.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:23.840]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:24.840]  Hey there.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  Yep, I'm right here.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:26.840]  Go right ahead.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.840]  You're live.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.840]  Yeah, I want to ask you.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:31.840]  I've got a link to Dr. Brzezinski.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.840]  I'm sorry, there's a video that shows that cancer cure.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:38.840]  I've watched his video.
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:40.840]  I've watched the Lorraine Day video.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.840]  I own the Gerson books.
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:43.840]  I've got the whole nine yards.
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.840]  Yes, so I'm very familiar.
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:46.840]  Your question?
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:47.840]  Awesome.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.840]  Awesome.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:51.840]  No, I just wanted to talk about how the FDA tried to ruin this guy
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:54.840]  and all the book and juries that they brought up.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.840]  Let me speak to that real quick, Mark,
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  because this is one of the things, man.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.840]  I was going off on this yesterday with my husband.
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:02.840]  I'm like, I'm writing a book.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:03.840]  I'm writing a book.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.840]  Because the fact that the FDA goes after somebody
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:08.840]  is not necessarily a badge of honor.
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.840]  Oftentimes, and I'm going to put Brzezinski to the side.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:13.840]  We could have a whole separate conversation
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.840]  because I think his treatment is one of the ones that,
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:17.840]  as far as I can tell, is kind of on the edge.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:19.840]  Like, I can't totally discredit it.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:22.840]  I'm also not blown away with its effectiveness.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.840]  But there are true charlatans out there.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  I mean, real people like there's a thing called,
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:31.840]  what is it, MMS, which is an actual heavily toxic compound
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.840]  that would kill you if you were to take it.
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:36.840]  And you got those people out there promoting that kind of stuff.
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:38.840]  So I don't know, when the FDA goes after somebody,
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.840]  it may really be because they deserve being gone after.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:44.840]  You know, I'm not a huge fan of the FDA going after people,
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.840]  but sometimes it's warranted.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:49.840]  So just because somebody got, you know, shut down by the FDA
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.840]  doesn't mean they had a cancer cure.
