[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.520 --> 00:21.280]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.280 --> 00:44.600]  We're kicking off another week as the awakening to the true nature of the political system on
[00:44.600 --> 00:52.520]  this planet accelerates. And as the corrupt tyrants attempt to set up classical police
[00:52.520 --> 00:57.920]  states in every major nation they control, the battle is certainly joined.
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.000]  In the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today, Bev Harris, one of the leading experts on
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.560]  election fraud and irregularities, will be joining us to talk about her report, Recipe
[01:10.560 --> 01:20.160]  for Vote Fraud, global Internet voting firm buys US election results reporting firm. What
[01:20.160 --> 01:28.380]  did Joe Stalin say? He said, I care not who cast the votes, I care only who counts them.
[01:28.380 --> 01:33.760]  So we're gonna be talking to Bev at the end of the broadcast today, the last 30 minutes
[01:33.760 --> 01:42.880]  about that. In the meantime, we are going to cover, obviously, the incredible economic
[01:42.880 --> 01:49.160]  developments, the latest on Iran, looks like some good news for now.
[01:49.160 --> 01:55.000]  More on killer flu doctors, US censorship is a danger to science. We've got that report
[01:55.000 --> 02:04.920]  as well. And also here in Texas, I saw a news report out of the South Texas papers in the
[02:04.920 --> 02:17.600]  Houston Chronicle and also in the Galveston Daily News that a 16-year-old woman, girl,
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.080]  was getting out of the shower and came out and there were two robbers had broken into
[02:21.080 --> 02:22.080]  the house.
[02:22.080 --> 02:29.700]  She ran and got a firearm and chased him out. And I tuned into local radio, supposedly conservative,
[02:29.700 --> 02:37.880]  and they were decrying what she'd done. And I heard callers saying, yes, she's too young
[02:37.880 --> 02:43.640]  to have a gun and might have hurt herself. What if they were armed? I mean, it is a religion
[02:43.640 --> 02:53.800]  to be gelded, domesticated ninnies. And it's supposedly trendy to not train your sons and
[02:53.800 --> 02:55.900]  daughters how to use a firearm.
[02:55.900 --> 03:02.480]  And if they do, it's seen as, well, uncouth and barbaric. We should all live in New York
[03:02.480 --> 03:07.880]  City or Chicago and have seven or eight locks on our doors. And the criminals bust in and
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.080]  you just basically roll over and say, please don't kill me, rape me, rob me, whatever.
[03:13.080 --> 03:18.200]  I mean, the answer to people breaking into your house is killing them. That's why you
[03:18.200 --> 03:26.100]  look at places that have higher firearms ownership and there is a total graph that follows that
[03:26.100 --> 03:31.400]  there's less home invasions, less muggings, less carjackings, less robberies.
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.960]  It varies year to year, but it's generally for every crime committed with a firearm,
[03:35.960 --> 03:44.000]  there's 20 plus crimes, 21, 25, 24, depends on the year. 20 plus crimes that are frustrated
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.680]  or stopped according to the Justice Department's own numbers, you can pull those up. But I
[03:49.680 --> 04:00.380]  just, I see this paradox of people who are so scared of firearms that they never train
[04:00.380 --> 04:03.360]  their sons, their daughters how to use them.
[04:03.360 --> 04:08.660]  And they just send them out into the world to be raped, robbed, and killed. And it's
[04:08.660 --> 04:16.720]  a badge of honor for people to be abused. Every few days I see an article out of California
[04:16.720 --> 04:22.340]  or Texas or Florida, it was a couple out of California in the last two weeks, where people
[04:22.340 --> 04:29.160]  are breaking in. They're coming in with a knife or gun and the women call 911 and ask
[04:29.160 --> 04:30.160]  permission.
[04:30.160 --> 04:36.000]  And 911 says, well, I'm not going to tell you what to do. Then the women shoot the people
[04:36.000 --> 04:47.280]  and then they have a debate in the media, was it right? It's scary. Okay, I'm going
[04:47.280 --> 04:51.360]  to go through a bunch of the news. Huntsman has dropped out. I'm going to get more into
[04:51.360 --> 05:00.800]  this ship sinking and the captain twiddling his thumbs. All of it's coming up today.
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.720]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century? Record foreclosure

[06:09.400 --> 06:14.720]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as
[06:14.720 --> 06:20.120]  one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence
[06:20.120 --> 06:25.920]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes

[06:45.800 --> 06:51.920]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[07:07.680 --> 07:12.640]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[07:12.640 --> 07:21.720]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset cheese. They sow
[07:21.720 --> 07:30.960]  pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[07:30.960 --> 07:39.400]  in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gusset's got it. Others don't. We

[08:04.640 --> 08:14.560]  behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:14.560 --> 08:26.840]  Well a foreign company has bought up the big national grid that tallies national elections.
[08:26.840 --> 08:33.000]  And we're gonna have Bev Harris, the top election fraud expert, joining us in the last 30 minutes
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.560]  of the broadcast today. To discuss it, I wanna welcome all of the listeners who are tuning
[08:38.560 --> 08:47.080]  in to this Monday, the 16th day of January 2012 worldwide broadcast.
[08:47.080 --> 08:51.480]  And after I just mentioned some of the top stories and some of the topics and issues
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.040]  that I think are most important, I'm gonna open the phones up for the next two and a
[08:56.040 --> 09:01.520]  half hours until Bev Harris joins us interspersed with different news clips and things that
[09:01.520 --> 09:07.000]  we're gonna be analyzing here on air. And callers are welcome to call in about any subject
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.360]  they want. But I first want to folks here some of the news I'm gonna throw out there
[09:12.360 --> 09:14.440]  before I open the phones up.
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.200]  Now we don't really screen your calls. We do ask your first name where you're calling
[09:19.200 --> 09:27.440]  from. You could make up any name you wish from Alaric to Porky Pig, I don't care. You
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.720]  could call yourself a cable or else for all I care. But it is interesting to hear from
[09:31.720 --> 09:37.960]  you how you're listening, whether it's XM Channel 166 or AM and FM station in your area
[09:37.960 --> 09:45.480]  or via the different internet TV boxes or just the audio streams at infowars.com or
[09:45.480 --> 09:47.840]  the video streams at presidentplanet.tv.
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.840]  Because it's not just a radio show, we also simulcast it as a TV show. If you're a new
[09:52.840 --> 09:59.840]  listener and you hear me saying, put that on screen, please. And that's my great producers
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.400]  and directors in there that run the show, scrambling to post different articles and
[10:05.400 --> 10:09.400]  things on screen so that there is a video record.
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.600]  When I say something outrageous like Dine Corps has been caught running giant white
[10:14.600 --> 10:21.520]  slavery rings, that means sex slaves, children included. And I say Chicago Tribune, they
[10:21.520 --> 10:28.260]  can go pull it up and put it on screen so that people who watch this later in posterity
[10:28.260 --> 10:32.760]  or either live at prisonplanet.tv or the millions, the tens of millions that watch
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.900]  us each week on the different video services out there like YouTube and others.
[10:37.900 --> 10:46.560]  They can actually see the truth of what I'm saying. If I mentioned that Canadian papers
[10:46.560 --> 10:52.000]  are reporting high levels of different radioactive isotopes from Fukushima, we can put that on
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.920]  screen. You see, what this radio show really does is it ends the compartmentalization.
[10:58.920 --> 11:05.840]  Because I look at international news, I look at Japanese news, British news, Russian, Iranian,
[11:05.840 --> 11:14.420]  Mexican news, Venezuelan news, Nicaraguan news, South African news, Libyan news. We
[11:14.420 --> 11:24.920]  look at it all, alternative news, YouTube reporters, movie clips, my own commentary,
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.440]  my own humor.
[11:26.440 --> 11:30.360]  Sometimes it's so lame, people don't even know it's humor. I mean, it's basically a
[11:30.360 --> 11:41.200]  complete free for all with an overriding mixture of a serious desire to be free and to bring
[11:41.200 --> 11:46.320]  bullies and criminals to justice. And that's really what it comes down to. A spirit of
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.360]  1776 worldwide, this broadcast is into the individual.
[11:51.360 --> 11:58.840]  It's into freedom of speech. I agree with Ron Paul, there's no room for racism on my
[11:58.840 --> 12:06.080]  radio show because I believe in individuals. And so that's not compatible in my worldview.
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.760]  I'm into the conduct of your life, the content of your mind, what you stand for, what you
[12:12.760 --> 12:18.120]  produce. Because at the end of the day, that is what we leave behind. That doesn't mean
[12:18.120 --> 12:20.880]  there isn't racism out there from all different groups.
[12:20.880 --> 12:26.000]  There isn't reverse racism, political correctness is a control system. And so we do analyze
[12:26.000 --> 12:34.640]  that here. But I am someone who looks at things on an individual basis and that's what I seek
[12:34.640 --> 12:41.240]  for in my everyday life. But I also do see that political correctness is used as a weapon
[12:41.240 --> 12:49.520]  to shutter even basic discussion in this society and it's used as a tool.
[12:49.520 --> 12:59.400]  In fact, I mentioned this yesterday on the Sunday radio show, and I never got to it.
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.720]  So it's not our top story here today, but I do intend to get to a little bit more later.
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.740]  But Ron Paul 2012 haters discussed KKK smear campaign against him International Business
[13:11.740 --> 13:19.000]  Times. And that's what the haters do. They will use political correctness to build a
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.880]  straw man on somebody or use something and take it out of context to then try to derail
[13:26.880 --> 13:33.080]  somebody like Ron Paul. There's a new hit piece out that Ron Paul flies first class
[13:33.080 --> 13:36.000]  when he flies to and from Washington DC.
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.520]  Yeah, seen most senior congressman like himself actually demand private jet rides like Nancy
[13:43.520 --> 13:51.560]  Pelosi and Boehner and others who have Air Force three and four and five giant large
[13:51.560 --> 13:57.780]  jet aircraft that cost millions of dollars a month to maintain and fly. Ron Paul has
[13:57.780 --> 14:03.320]  been criticized for on his campaign trail using campaign money to fly first class.
[14:03.320 --> 14:10.120]  I wish he was conducted on a bed of roses. He's 76 years old. He works out every morning
[14:10.120 --> 14:17.580]  barely each. But I've told him he should be on private jets. In fact, as much as he's
[14:17.580 --> 14:22.300]  flying, they're a lot quicker. They're a lot less stressful. He's complained on this show
[14:22.300 --> 14:26.440]  because he's got metal parts in him everywhere he goes.
[14:26.440 --> 14:34.440]  He gets cropped, played a lot of sports. He's got a lot of injuries. And he talks about
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.480]  them grabbing his genitals and how it's disgusting it is. Ron Paul, who is number two in the
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.760]  presidential race, should not be flying commercial aircraft right now. But instead, I've got
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.160]  LA Times, Fox News, Chicago Tribune, Washington Post.
[14:51.160 --> 14:58.540]  You'd think it's the number one story in the country right now that Ron Paul is flying
[14:58.540 --> 15:06.200]  first class on the campaign and when he flies to Congress. I mean, it is ridiculous. Ron
[15:06.200 --> 15:12.360]  Paul, you can really see the age and how much he's working getting to him. I mean, I've
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.880]  told the campaign privately and I'll say it here. He should not be doing all this retail
[15:15.880 --> 15:19.800]  politics which is exhausting to somebody 37 years old like myself.
[15:19.800 --> 15:26.080]  I mean, I love meeting people and it's incredibly humbling and kind of freaks me out. I've become
[15:26.080 --> 15:34.440]  more and more reclusive by the day. And just everywhere I go now, I mean, I go to a barbecue
[15:34.440 --> 15:40.120]  joint on Saturday night with my family. And every person behind the counter, every person
[15:40.120 --> 15:45.720]  in the place is a listener and starts coming over and shaking my hand.
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.500]  Everywhere I go now, I mean, it is, and again, I don't just shake somebody's hand like a
[15:50.500 --> 15:58.100]  fake politician. I read them, I see them, I listen to them, and I see the admiration
[15:58.100 --> 16:02.660]  in their eyes. And quite frankly, it freaks me out. I mean, I'm digressing off into myself
[16:02.660 --> 16:04.880]  right now because I know I'm a good person.
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.580]  I'm trying as hard as I can, but I'm not that good. What I'm saying is I can't believe the
[16:09.580 --> 16:13.800]  responsibility I've got. And I know Ron Paul is the same. I've been with him at events
[16:13.800 --> 16:19.500]  over the years, seen him sit there and look people up and down and really talk to him.
[16:19.500 --> 16:23.180]  People get mad at politicians because there's like a glaze in their eyes. Sometimes I've
[16:23.180 --> 16:27.280]  been in an event for like 10 hours and just stay in a crowd shaking hands with thousands
[16:27.280 --> 16:28.280]  of people.
[16:28.280 --> 16:33.160]  And after about four or five hours, you do glaze over. Because it's so exhausting to
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.920]  actually really read somebody and talk to them. So that's normal when you really shake
[16:38.920 --> 16:45.340]  somebody's hand, look in their eye, you read them. It's an automatic thing and it's exhausting.
[16:45.340 --> 16:53.000]  And I'm telling you folks, Ron Paul is many days more than eight hours out in crowds.
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  And I understand people like to shake your hand and like to meet you, but let me tell
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.500]  you, I can see it in the debates. He looks tired for the first time ever. And so does
[17:01.500 --> 17:04.020]  Mitt Romney and the rest of them who are a lot younger.
[17:04.020 --> 17:08.900]  So Ron Paul should be going electronic. I know he turns on a lot of interviews that
[17:08.900 --> 17:14.020]  reach a lot of people instead to go meet 100 people and give them a speech. And now he's
[17:14.020 --> 17:20.460]  hitting bigger states. The campaign needs to completely shift out of retail politics.
[17:20.460 --> 17:27.920]  Ron Paul just can't do it. The strategy is electronic. But I now digress. He's got other
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.600]  things to deal with, where there's all these Facebook pages, where they're recruiting.
[17:33.600 --> 17:38.980]  And this is how we caught Democratic operatives in the Rand Paul race who were running against
[17:38.980 --> 17:43.140]  him. People that worked for the other campaign got caught, dressed up in John Deere hats
[17:43.140 --> 17:49.660]  and checkered shirts, kind of what you'd call hayseed outfits, which is condescending to
[17:49.660 --> 17:56.540]  rural people, the backbone of this country and holding up racist signs.
[17:56.540 --> 18:00.380]  And the media nationally did run with it. Kind of like two weeks ago, Huntsman operatives
[18:00.380 --> 18:06.220]  got caught creating ads, making fun of Asian people basically and implying that don't vote
[18:06.220 --> 18:12.180]  for Huntsman because he's adopted Asian children and was the ambassador to China. Now it's
[18:12.180 --> 18:16.340]  the issues that he worked for Obama and that MSNBC keeps praising him.
[18:16.340 --> 18:25.220]  I mean, when MSNBC, the Obama channel is endorsing you, you know that the person works for Obama.
[18:25.220 --> 18:29.980]  But again, Fox, MSNBC, they all ran with it and called for Ron Paul to apologize. And
[18:29.980 --> 18:35.260]  of course, none of them retracted when it came out, it was Huntsman's people. But now
[18:35.260 --> 18:39.980]  it's come out that they are organizing to dress up as KKK operatives.
[18:39.980 --> 18:43.300]  And they linked through and found the people on the Facebook indeed are people that have
[18:43.300 --> 18:51.700]  protested against Paul. And so they're trying to pick up on this. So this is the type of
[18:51.700 --> 18:59.580]  dirty trick that gets run out there. And they use race on every issue. That's why I've made
[18:59.580 --> 19:08.460]  the point, forget race. Mitt Romney, Barack Obama, they're basically the same person.
[19:08.460 --> 19:15.580]  There's just different parties. One is a Republican, one is a Democrat. But in the final equation,
[19:15.580 --> 19:19.020]  I mean, look at this, then I'm gonna come back and get into all the other news. Look
[19:19.020 --> 19:21.900]  at this Rasmussen poll out today.
[19:21.900 --> 19:34.500]  Others see all GOP hopefuls as conservative, but Romney and Paul. So they don't see Romney
[19:34.500 --> 19:44.500]  as conservative enough or Paul even more so they say, Paul Lisa. And I guess that shows
[19:44.500 --> 19:53.700]  how by moving the Overton window, by moving political perception, now with Romney, they
[19:53.700 --> 19:59.740]  think open borders, gun control, abortion, carbon taxes, writing Obamacare, that's now
[19:59.740 --> 20:01.140]  conservative.
[20:01.140 --> 20:05.540]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial

[21:41.100 --> 21:44.760]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[21:44.760 --> 21:48.460]  of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a

[24:14.420 --> 24:20.860]  from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here. Many stations rebroadcast at night. We're
[24:20.860 --> 24:25.180]  very thankful for that. We also come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Then there's the nightly
[24:25.180 --> 24:30.300]  news 7 o'clock every evening. I end up doing the nightly news on average about four nights
[24:30.300 --> 24:31.300]  a week.
[24:31.300 --> 24:35.260]  We have Aaron Dykes that does it as well. Tonight, the health ranger Mike Adams is gonna
[24:35.260 --> 24:40.740]  be sitting in another great Austin night as we transmitted across the world. Paul Watson
[24:40.740 --> 24:46.660]  occasionally hosted as well as Rob Dew. Okay, let me do this. Let me just go over some of
[24:46.660 --> 24:53.980]  the headlines that I'll get back into more detail on as the broadcast unfolds today.
[24:53.980 --> 24:58.540]  And then we're gonna come back and start going to your phone calls on these issues or whatever
[24:58.540 --> 25:04.860]  issues you'd like to raise. But I do wanna throw this out to listeners. I don't usually
[25:04.860 --> 25:10.860]  follow the classic talk radio format of what's your favorite color or another pit bull ate
[25:10.860 --> 25:16.880]  another child. What do you think should be done about this?
[25:16.880 --> 25:23.140]  But there are times that I do wanna hear your view on things. Generally, I open the phones
[25:23.140 --> 25:28.980]  up just as a random grab bag to see what news you're gonna raise or what point you're gonna
[25:28.980 --> 25:37.860]  bring up that we can then discuss. It adds that incredible wild card to the broadcast.
[25:37.860 --> 25:47.220]  That's why I take calls. And it's a humbling process to get calls from all over the world.
[25:47.220 --> 25:51.900]  But occasionally I really do on a general topic want to get your view on what do you
[25:51.900 --> 26:00.260]  think is gonna happen in 2012? What do you think of the whole 2012 end of the world scenario
[26:00.260 --> 26:06.820]  that I'm seeing more and more and even mainline newspapers and TV implying that this year
[26:06.820 --> 26:12.660]  is gonna be fraught with catastrophe and doom?
[26:12.660 --> 26:18.860]  I don't think that. But I'm already seeing editorials in newspapers where they'll say,
[26:18.860 --> 26:24.180]  yeah, why should we even care? Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura, I saw one of these a few
[26:24.180 --> 26:30.060]  days ago, think the world's gonna end anyways. I have never said the world's gonna end on
[26:30.060 --> 26:36.940]  2012. But sure enough, I'm gonna get blamed for it. When the world doesn't end, it'll
[26:36.940 --> 26:41.580]  be all my fault that anybody ever thought it was.
[26:41.580 --> 26:49.820]  I know that the media and Hollywood's been promoting it as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[26:49.820 --> 26:56.500]  That it's a foregone conclusion that the world's gonna end. So why should you be politically
[26:56.500 --> 27:02.340]  involved? And I saw this in 2002. Planet X is gonna kill everybody next year, so why
[27:02.340 --> 27:07.280]  be politically involved? And I got criticized for saying that it wasn't coming and there's
[27:07.280 --> 27:08.280]  no such thing.
[27:08.280 --> 27:13.580]  I mean, sure, there's hundreds of discovered planetoids out past Pluto. That's why Pluto
[27:13.580 --> 27:19.020]  is no longer a planet, cuz there's planetoids bigger than Pluto. So you'd have to have hundreds
[27:19.020 --> 27:25.260]  of planets out in the Kuiper belt. So there's always a grain of truth to this stuff. And
[27:25.260 --> 27:28.500]  then I always societally get blamed for it.
[27:28.500 --> 27:31.840]  I'll be on some of the radio show and they're like, you're the guy that thinks Planet X
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.700]  is gonna kill us. Or you're the guy saying 2012's the end of the world. No, I'm the guy
[27:36.700 --> 27:44.140]  saying it isn't. But let's be clear about something. The New York Times reported last
[27:44.140 --> 27:49.180]  Monday and we talked about it a lot with the headline, Manufactured Doomsday.
[27:49.180 --> 27:53.820]  And we'll put that back on screen for folks who are watching on prisonplanet.tv. And they
[27:53.820 --> 28:02.460]  talked about the fact that as part of the BioShield program, 9 billion under Bush, tens
[28:02.460 --> 28:10.500]  of billions now under Obama. They have 36 level four weapons labs and in subsidiaries,
[28:10.500 --> 28:11.500]  too many to count.
[28:11.500 --> 28:16.660]  I can't find an actual number. It looks like it's over 200. Where they're developing every
[28:16.660 --> 28:28.940]  airborne weaponized strain of every nightmare you can imagine. And it's very, very frustrating.
[28:28.940 --> 28:35.540]  Now, that's an interesting headline, but the headline is, from the New York Times last
[28:35.540 --> 28:46.060]  week was Manufacturing Doomsday, or Manufactured Doomsday, I wanna reprint that for me.
[28:46.060 --> 28:50.980]  Because I wanna cover that more later. That's what keeps me up at night. That's what I'm
[28:50.980 --> 28:57.380]  concerned about. Because some of these different weaponized airborne mousepox and the rest
[28:57.380 --> 29:04.140]  of it, kill over 90% of those that comes in contact with. Mousepox designed for humans,
[29:04.140 --> 29:05.340]  99%.
[29:05.340 --> 29:11.580]  How to build it, how to make it in a moderately expensive lab for a couple $100,000 with
[29:11.580 --> 29:23.340]  a good biochemist was released five years ago by the university in Australia. That's
[29:23.340 --> 29:29.100]  the kind of stuff I think about. So I'm not saying there couldn't be a doomsday. But most
[29:29.100 --> 29:35.740]  of this doomsday stuff is what we're doing to ourselves, is what we've produced ourselves.
[29:35.740 --> 29:39.740]  It's not because the Mayans said it was the end of the world in 2012. And I'm not saying
[29:39.740 --> 29:46.460]  this stuff's gonna get released this year. I'm saying we're sitting on top a keg of dynamite
[29:46.460 --> 29:50.260]  playing with matches and it's not smart. More news, your calls.
[29:50.260 --> 30:00.740]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.740 --> 30:05.380]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:05.380 --> 30:09.780]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:09.780 --> 30:14.420]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[30:14.420 --> 30:20.060]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[30:20.060 --> 30:24.700]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.700 --> 30:30.140]  overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[30:30.140 --> 30:34.540]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[30:34.540 --> 30:38.860]  their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[30:38.860 --> 30:42.940]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[30:42.940 --> 30:47.120]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[30:58.540 --> 31:06.300]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[31:06.300 --> 31:11.660]  opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company

[31:27.340 --> 31:33.580]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating
[31:33.580 --> 31:37.500]  clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never
[31:37.500 --> 31:41.420]  had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[32:01.260 --> 32:06.860]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[32:06.860 --> 32:12.460]  to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[32:12.460 --> 32:18.700]  the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president and congress and they really are
[32:18.700 --> 32:24.940]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[32:24.940 --> 32:30.380]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[32:30.380 --> 32:35.820]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[32:35.820 --> 32:40.140]  Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[32:40.140 --> 32:45.740]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[32:45.740 --> 32:53.660]  we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com
[32:53.660 --> 33:16.700]  or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[33:16.700 --> 33:26.540]  The more of you that I inspect, the more of me I should reflect,
[33:28.140 --> 33:35.900]  the more I try to read your lips, the more the mask you wear and rip. When I seek out your voice,
[33:37.580 --> 33:43.660]  my ears are overcome with noise. You show and tell the greatest deeds,
[33:43.660 --> 33:49.500]  craving possibilities.
[34:01.340 --> 34:08.140]  Yeah, that's the immortal Dave Mustaine. Angry again, angry again.
[34:08.140 --> 34:15.340]  All I've got to do is look at my children and think about all the stuff we have to go through
[34:15.340 --> 34:21.340]  to keep them away from GMO, the bistrene, all A and the fact that it's almost impossible to do it.
[34:21.980 --> 34:29.020]  And that the system is purposefully trying to give us all sorts of illnesses so they can then
[34:29.020 --> 34:34.380]  like drug dealers get us addicted to all their big pharma. That makes me get angry again.
[34:34.380 --> 34:42.380]  And I'm not somebody to just get angry and just sit around. And I know you're not and that's why
[34:42.380 --> 34:46.540]  you listen to this broadcast. I'm here to take action. And by the way, we've got some good news
[34:46.540 --> 34:54.380]  coming up. They're now reporting that the Internet takeover bill SOPA is dead on arrival because of
[34:54.380 --> 35:01.260]  just absolute backlash and the system never wants to teach the public that they have power.
[35:01.260 --> 35:11.420]  In fact, that is such a key point that the globalists never want to give us
[35:12.380 --> 35:20.700]  a chance to meet them head on, to meet them straight on. The same thing happened
[35:22.300 --> 35:25.740]  two Thanksgivings ago, one of the biggest flight days of the year,
[35:25.740 --> 35:33.180]  a year and a half ago or so, the National Opt Out Day. And all over the country, people were refusing
[35:33.180 --> 35:39.020]  to body scan. So for two weeks, they just turned off all the body scanners and even the Washington
[35:39.020 --> 35:42.700]  Post, weeks after we reported on it, admitted that there was a stand down.
[35:42.700 --> 35:47.260]  Now I thought terrorism is so imminent that they've got to get that old lady to stand up,
[35:47.260 --> 35:51.980]  who can't stand up in a wheelchair. They've got to take that colostomy bag off that old man.
[35:51.980 --> 35:57.980]  They've got to rip that urology bag off the lady. They've got to put their hands in the pants and
[35:57.980 --> 36:03.820]  go into the body of Miss USA in Dallas. They've got to go in the pants of a one year old baby
[36:03.820 --> 36:09.660]  and fondle them. They've got to do it to keep you safe. But for two weeks, they completely stood
[36:09.660 --> 36:13.980]  down because they didn't want to give you a chance to say no and show your power.
[36:14.780 --> 36:18.140]  And I had told my IT people that January 18th,
[36:18.140 --> 36:21.580]  in fact, we were getting ready to make the announcement today that we were gonna go black,
[36:22.300 --> 36:30.620]  go dark, turn the lights off. On Infowars, we're gonna leave prison planet up and have it all
[36:30.620 --> 36:35.580]  direct to one article about SOPA. And you know what, I think I still may do that, but have an
[36:35.580 --> 36:39.260]  article about why they never wanna give us a chance to actually fight them.
[36:39.260 --> 36:46.140]  Because if we would have had Google and Wikipedia and Reddit, all started by Reddit,
[36:46.140 --> 36:55.580]  leading the way. And Infowars and maybe even Drudge, turn off that day, that would show people
[36:56.140 --> 37:02.140]  that the Internet is built by independent news agencies and systems. And that we have the power
[37:02.140 --> 37:07.740]  to boycott the entire system if they try to kill it incrementally. And that would have shut them
[37:07.740 --> 37:13.100]  down and defeated them. So now they said just two weeks ago, it's gonna pass, you can't stop us.
[37:13.100 --> 37:17.980]  It's gonna pass, you can't stop us. We've got 100 plus votes more than we need in the House.
[37:17.980 --> 37:21.580]  A lot more votes we need in the Senate, 30 plus votes they were saying.
[37:21.580 --> 37:27.100]  It will pass, none of this is true. Just let go, daddy, a month ago. And we have,
[37:27.100 --> 37:33.660]  by the way, the guy that started that boycott on, Frederick, IT professional himself.
[37:36.700 --> 37:41.340]  They don't ever, I mean, at first they sent him emails and said, so what, do whatever you want,
[37:41.340 --> 37:44.460]  you're having no effect on us. And then they were brought to their knees.
[37:46.060 --> 37:51.660]  And other companies were brought to their knees by the people taking action and exercising their
[37:51.660 --> 37:58.140]  power. So the system never wants you to have a chance to win a fight. They never want you to
[37:58.140 --> 38:04.700]  get in the arena as a 12-year-old in Golden Gloves and win your first bout.
[38:04.700 --> 38:12.060]  Because that's gonna build your confidence. They never want to build your confidence,
[38:12.060 --> 38:18.140]  they just want you to lose and lose and lose and lose. Same thing, they passed the National
[38:18.140 --> 38:22.380]  Defense Authorization Act. But then they tried to say it doesn't affect citizens.
[38:22.380 --> 38:27.260]  We forced them to admit it did. Then they said, well, don't worry, the President won't sign it
[38:27.260 --> 38:31.180]  so that we couldn't build opposition. Then he did sign it. Then he said, well,
[38:31.180 --> 38:36.380]  I sign it, but reluctantly, I won't use this power I've got to grab you and put a black bag
[38:36.380 --> 38:42.220]  over your head and have you disappear. But then we've got Santorum in a clip I played yesterday
[38:42.220 --> 38:47.820]  saying, we'll kill US citizens if we want. Of course they will. And Lindsey Graham,
[38:47.820 --> 38:55.020]  that creepy guy, all of them. Look, they want these illegal powers, but they don't want to have
[38:55.020 --> 39:00.540]  a face down at high noon with us. So the point is they don't really have those powers.
[39:00.540 --> 39:05.180]  You can pass tyranny, it doesn't legalize it, but you've got to be able to implement it.
[39:06.060 --> 39:11.420]  You've got to be able to then use it. Just claiming you're king of the universe
[39:11.420 --> 39:19.740]  doesn't make it so. You can walk into some big church and walk up to the biggest, meanest looking
[39:19.740 --> 39:25.180]  guy and say, I can kick your hind in. Until you've taken him out in the parking lot and
[39:25.180 --> 39:31.260]  actually kicked his butt, you haven't actually done that. Talk is cheap. You can walk up as a
[39:31.260 --> 39:37.420]  rodeo rider to the biggest, meanest, baddest, vicious bull that stomped people's guts out,
[39:37.420 --> 39:44.940]  never been ridden. Eight seconds and say I can ride that bull. Let's see you do it then.
[39:46.620 --> 39:49.580]  It was easy for George W Bush, never in combat,
[39:49.580 --> 39:54.220]  chicken-hot with all these deferments to keep him in the Air National Guard.
[39:55.660 --> 40:01.020]  It's easy for him to say bring it on to the insurgents and watch US troop number
[40:01.580 --> 40:06.940]  of deaths skyrocket. Yeah, it's real easy when you're not in the arena to say bring it on.
[40:12.940 --> 40:18.060]  By the way, the guys were having trouble finding that headline because I was calling it a
[40:18.060 --> 40:22.860]  Manufactured doomsday. That's how my memory screws things up. In the New York Times, it's an
[40:22.860 --> 40:33.820]  engineered doomsday. A engineered doomsday is the New York Times. Scientists have long worried that
[40:33.820 --> 40:39.820]  an influenza virus that has ravaged poultry and wild birds in Asia might evolve to pose a threat
[40:39.820 --> 40:43.420]  to humans. Now scientists financed by the National Institutes of Health,
[40:43.420 --> 40:47.740]  have shown in a laboratory how that could happen. In the process, they created a virus that could
[40:47.740 --> 40:53.660]  kill tens or hundreds of millions of people that escaped confinement or was stolen by terrorists.
[40:56.140 --> 41:01.100]  Gee, standing ovations for Dr. Peter Singer, Dr. Eric Pianka,
[41:02.060 --> 41:07.980]  and countless others at top academies of science events that have been covered in the news when
[41:07.980 --> 41:13.740]  they talk about releasing an airborne weapon to reduce the population, they get standing ovations.
[41:13.740 --> 41:19.980]  Who do you think are eugenicists? Who do you think the system chooses to give the PhDs and
[41:19.980 --> 41:27.580]  doctorates in this? Why don't you, wherever you live near a major university, go sit in on Dr.
[41:27.580 --> 41:31.900]  Eric Pianka, five miles from where I sit. He has classes, you can go sit in them.
[41:31.900 --> 41:36.620]  And go in there and stop him after class and ask him if 90% of us should be killed.
[41:37.820 --> 41:41.820]  And then find out where his graduate students are working. They're working in BioShield,
[41:41.820 --> 41:48.540]  they're working on this. And they send me emails routinely attacking me with links to who they are,
[41:48.540 --> 41:54.540]  and they're very proud of themselves. Send me an email, and I'll send you an email.
[41:54.540 --> 41:58.140]  And I'll send you an email, and I'll send you an email, and I'll send you an email,
[41:58.140 --> 42:01.340]  and I'll send you an email, and I'll send you an email, and I'll send you an email,
[42:01.340 --> 42:05.180]  you know, saying, how can you deny humans are a parasite, need to be eradicated?
[42:05.180 --> 42:11.740]  It's like I'm the crazy person, and I'm bad to talk about their rock star. I get these emails,
[42:11.740 --> 42:19.580]  Dr. Pianka, and Dr. Singer, and Ted Turner in the UN, they're rock stars. Oh, yeah,
[42:19.580 --> 42:23.180]  and you know what? I mean, you read about Pianka, the Texas Academy of Sciences,
[42:23.180 --> 42:32.700]  standing ovations, people crying when he talks about how they're gonna kill 90% of us.
[42:32.700 --> 42:41.020]  That's who these people are. Why don't you just randomly go into the, go hear the head of the
[42:41.020 --> 42:46.780]  psychology department in a university when they teach classes. And go sit in, and then if they
[42:46.780 --> 42:52.700]  don't talk about eugenics, or population reduction, or anti-family stuff while you're there, ask them.
[42:52.700 --> 42:56.300]  Go to one of their speeches, and then ask them in the question and answer their view on it.
[42:56.300 --> 43:03.580]  You'll find nine out of ten, conservatively, are flaming anti-human eugenicists who are
[43:03.580 --> 43:10.620]  ultra creepy and ultra sick, and who are part of an anti-human eugenics cult that runs society.
[43:12.060 --> 43:18.780]  And all of the psychological warfare, and the propaganda, and the obsession with celebrities,
[43:18.780 --> 43:24.780]  all of it, they admit, in hundreds of published books by them, is completely manufactured,
[43:26.700 --> 43:33.180]  and fake, and designed to screw you up, and designed to take away your basic survival instinct.
[43:35.980 --> 43:40.540]  So I wanna talk about 2012. I don't think it's the end of the world because
[43:40.540 --> 43:43.420]  the lingered serpent that the Mayans worship said so.
[43:43.420 --> 43:49.820]  By the way, the Mayans didn't even say that. It's a new age, they believed, a new hearth.
[43:50.460 --> 43:59.180]  The fire is put out, and a new hearth is ignited. So they believe a new sun is gonna be turned off
[43:59.180 --> 44:05.660]  and turned back on. What do you wanna guess that December 25th, or whatever it is,
[44:05.660 --> 44:09.580]  what's the date it's supposed to all end this year? December 27th?
[44:09.580 --> 44:15.900]  December 21st, okay. I started a film years ago about it and just decided not to even release it.
[44:15.900 --> 44:19.980]  It was super powerful, would have made a ton of money, but I don't even care about making money.
[44:19.980 --> 44:24.700]  I am gonna probably do like a 30-minute special report, though, with a powerful title and just
[44:24.700 --> 44:29.980]  put the stinking thing out for free. But if I don't charge, though, it won't get 20 million
[44:29.980 --> 44:35.500]  views. See, if I charge for it for a month or so and then release it, it'll get 20 million views.
[44:35.500 --> 44:40.220]  If I give it away, it'll get a million. People don't appreciate stuff that's for free,
[44:40.220 --> 44:44.220]  don't ask me why. I guess because usually in life, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
[44:44.220 --> 44:50.700]  But see, I'm trying to stop a engineered doomsday. So I guess it isn't a free lunch,
[44:50.700 --> 44:55.820]  it's self-preservation. I don't want my kids dying when the globalists who are all obsessed
[44:55.820 --> 45:02.380]  with killing us release this stuff. Airborne weaponized smallpox, airborne weaponized mousepox,
[45:02.380 --> 45:09.500]  airborne weaponized Ebola, airborne weaponized hemorrhagic fever, airborne weaponized variants
[45:09.500 --> 45:17.500]  of bird flu, on and on and on. And I watch governments and corporations running around
[45:17.500 --> 45:22.780]  all building giant underground bunkers, multi-years power supplies, underground nukes,
[45:22.780 --> 45:29.020]  own water supplies. And in their own publications, talking about the end will soon be here,
[45:29.020 --> 45:34.620]  the world without humans, all the TV shows, preparing the public for mass death and the
[45:34.620 --> 45:41.260]  population being reduced so that we have a racial psychological memory, a false memory,
[45:41.260 --> 45:45.020]  a self-fulfilling prophecy that this is supposed to happen.
[45:45.020 --> 45:50.540]  So we'll all just crawl into our basements with our kids and die when they release this stuff.
[45:50.540 --> 45:55.900]  And then they re-emerge with The Cure three years later and have this new golden age they
[45:55.900 --> 46:00.380]  dream about all day with the hundreds and hundreds of quotes about how beautiful the Black Plague
[46:00.380 --> 46:05.020]  was, killing roughly one-third to a half of Europe, they're not sure, and how that spurred
[46:05.020 --> 46:10.540]  the Renaissance. It spurred the Renaissance cuz the elite got wiped out, and there weren't all
[46:10.540 --> 46:16.860]  these total monopolies anymore. It screwed up feudalism, and people had to pay for valuable
[46:16.860 --> 46:23.180]  services more. I mean, they're always glorifying the Black Plagues since the time of Malthus.
[46:23.180 --> 46:27.900]  And from an economics view, they don't even know why the Black Plague caused the giant Renaissance
[46:27.900 --> 46:35.020]  because the farmer people and the wives tales were practicing witchcraft, which was eating garlic and
[46:35.020 --> 46:40.300]  other herbs. And they were hiding out in the woods and knew what was killing them while the elite
[46:40.300 --> 46:48.220]  stayed in the cities and died. That's why we had a Renaissance cuz the elite got killed, not because
[46:48.220 --> 46:54.140]  it killed one-third to half. Again, the historians vary, it may have been more than half
[46:55.820 --> 46:59.420]  when that Black Plague-filled ship landed in Italy coming from Asia.
[47:03.260 --> 47:06.940]  And they'd killed most of the cats, believing they were demon-possessed.
[47:06.940 --> 47:11.100]  So the rat population explode. There'd been many Black Plague introductions into Europe,
[47:11.100 --> 47:18.460]  Central, Northern, Southern Europe, Rus, Russia, the red-haired people, Rus,
[47:19.500 --> 47:28.060]  Red. There'd been many introductions into that area, but they'd killed most of the cats.
[47:29.660 --> 47:33.740]  And so the rat population was out of control, and what were the rats carrying?
[47:33.740 --> 47:41.180]  They were carrying the fleas. And you know the rest of the story.
[47:43.100 --> 47:49.580]  You know the rest of the story, don't you? And of course, that was a system that killed between
[47:50.140 --> 47:52.460]  a third and half of those that came in contact with it.
[47:55.420 --> 47:57.900]  Now they've got weaponized bubonic plague.
[47:57.900 --> 48:04.380]  Oh, that's a horrible way to go. But you know, we have nursery rhymes about it.
[48:06.540 --> 48:09.820]  In fact, let's not go out with angry again, we already played it.
[48:09.820 --> 48:16.460]  Let's go out with just a nursery rhyme. Go to YouTube, type in ring around the rosy.
[48:17.900 --> 48:23.580]  Ring around the rosy, what's it say? Pocket full of posy.
[48:23.580 --> 48:28.860]  Ashes to ashes, we all fall down.
[48:31.980 --> 48:37.100]  Ring around the rosy, little rosy spot that's gonna be a big rattle in your face.
[48:38.300 --> 48:44.140]  Ashes to ashes, we all fall down. The globalist, you can see the preparatory phase,
[48:44.140 --> 48:52.060]  are getting everyone ready to ring around the rosy. Ashes to ashes, we all fall down.
[48:52.060 --> 48:54.700]  And you know what? I don't wanna go.
[48:55.980 --> 49:00.060]  I don't want a bunch of globalists to release this stuff and go dig in underground.
[49:03.500 --> 49:10.380]  And all these shows on History Channel, Discovery Channel, PBS, on the end caps at grocery stores.
[49:10.380 --> 49:14.940]  You know, the audiobook about the world after humans and how beautiful it's gonna be and
[49:14.940 --> 49:19.020]  how great it's gonna be. I mean, I don't like these psychos flaunting it in front of my face
[49:19.020 --> 49:23.820]  like I'm too stupid to hear what they're saying. No, I got you, Roger, Roger.
[49:30.940 --> 49:36.460]  All right, I'm gonna give the number out when we come back from break. When I start the second
[49:36.460 --> 49:41.100]  hour, I'll start going to your calls. I'll take calls the entire second hour and for 30 minutes
[49:41.100 --> 49:44.220]  into the third with news, but I haven't even gotten into the other news yet.
[49:44.220 --> 49:46.780]  Because all of this at the end of the day becomes a distraction.
[49:46.780 --> 49:50.620]  It's all important and I can get into sociology human,
[49:51.660 --> 49:53.820]  because knowing ourselves is the key to turning this around.
[49:55.740 --> 50:00.700]  I can always look at it from an anthropology psychology view, any article, and show how the
[50:00.700 --> 50:07.020]  media spins it or how they make us focus on distractions. The Iran stuff's huge,
[50:07.020 --> 50:11.740]  Huntsman dropping out is pretty big. This ship, another example in disasters.
[50:11.740 --> 50:17.820]  You can't trust governments to take care of you or protect you over and over again
[50:17.820 --> 50:21.740]  throughout history. So why are they always so obsessed with you not protecting yourself?
[50:23.580 --> 50:28.780]  We're gonna talk about that. We're gonna talk about a lot more coming up today,
[50:28.780 --> 50:32.620]  but I just wanted to get into the big issues here for everybody.
[50:32.620 --> 50:43.180]  Isn't that nice? Ring around the rosy. We'll, we'll come back from break with that. Yeah. Crank
[50:43.180 --> 50:58.300]  it up. It's all fun. It's a fun children's song. Ring around the rosy. We all fall down. Isn't it
[50:58.300 --> 51:05.100]  fun? We'll be right back. Whoever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century

[51:10.620 --> 51:16.140]  checks since you were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a

[55:20.940 --> 55:26.380]  I run into so many people that say they feel disempowered that life seems empty.
[55:26.380 --> 55:31.980]  They don't have purpose. Because you're following what the global controller,
[55:31.980 --> 55:37.340]  zombie, prostitute, corporate whore media has programmed into you.
[55:39.740 --> 55:44.940]  Look at the most fulfilled people out there. They're adventurers or they're rescue divers.
[55:44.940 --> 55:52.780]  Or they're athletes or they're people that help the poor. Why do you think so many wealthy people
[55:52.780 --> 55:59.900]  throughout history give away everything and go to Africa to be in bug infested areas to help
[55:59.900 --> 56:04.060]  poor people? Because that's what fulfills them, not because they're goody two shoes,
[56:04.620 --> 56:11.100]  but because that's what fills their soul. We are creators, we are meant to explore,
[56:11.100 --> 56:15.980]  we are meant to paint, we are meant to sculpt, we are meant to build, we are meant to love,
[56:15.980 --> 56:18.540]  we are meant to fight, we are meant to face bullies.
[56:19.740 --> 56:28.460]  I am so fulfilled, I have so much energy that I hate myself because my life is so good,
[56:28.460 --> 56:35.420]  so wonderful, and isn't one tenth of my potential. I can see over the horizon and see my potential
[56:35.420 --> 56:40.300]  and know that we, with this show alone, with you the listeners could change the course of
[56:40.300 --> 56:50.060]  human destiny. But I cannot mount the words or the calculations or the organizational skills to put
[56:50.060 --> 56:56.860]  the plan into function. We have seen a shadow of what we can do and all of you are capable as well.
[56:57.900 --> 57:02.940]  I want you to rise up in the info war. I want you to start YouTube channels. I want you to
[57:02.940 --> 57:07.260]  start local access shows. I want you to start a local Sunday radio show. Those are all entry
[57:07.260 --> 57:13.260]  points. Maybe some of you have got the money, the cultural skills, whatever, to get a national show.
[57:14.700 --> 57:18.540]  It's up to those of you. I mean, I know the people that are listening.
[57:20.780 --> 57:26.940]  Incredibly famous classical musicians, rock stars, movie stars, and nine times out of ten,
[57:26.940 --> 57:30.460]  they contact me and they say, we just want to thank you that you're out there, we listen every
[57:30.460 --> 57:35.820]  day. And then I talk to these people and they're just as smart as I am or smarter.
[57:35.820 --> 57:42.940]  I talked to a famous musician, extremely famous. His dad is the most famous musician.
[57:42.940 --> 57:47.260]  That says too much. I'm just gonna leave it right there. And as smart as I am or smarter
[57:47.260 --> 57:53.900]  and knows all of this, but isn't talking about it. Look, we need everybody in this fight,
[57:53.900 --> 57:59.740]  ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones isn't gonna beat the New World Order all by his lonesome.
[57:59.740 --> 58:09.740]  I'll ensure you of that. And I know I'm preaching because it's all coming down. It's all admitted,
[58:09.740 --> 58:12.860]  the world government's out in the open, everything. Here's the toll free number, 800-259-9231.
[58:12.860 --> 58:21.180]  800-259-9231. I've seen the phones ringing the whole time I've been on.
[58:21.180 --> 58:25.260]  Phones weren't open, folks, they're open now. 800-259-9231.
[58:25.260 --> 58:30.700]  Coming up, US military chief to Israel as Iran tension grows.

[58:38.700 --> 58:50.860]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.860 --> 58:55.020]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century?
[58:55.020 --> 58:59.180]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[58:59.180 --> 59:03.900]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off and placing your child's name
[59:03.900 --> 59:09.020]  on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[59:09.020 --> 59:12.620]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[59:12.620 --> 59:17.500]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control,
[59:17.500 --> 59:20.460]  your greatest dependency, your food supply.

[59:53.820 --> 59:56.140]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.820]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.940]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:21.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:27.020]  All right, coming up, the latest on the economy.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.700]  Also, Paul Hader's caught planning to dress up as KKK.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.100]  Opposed is Paul's supporters.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:41.180]  The media here in Texas, newspapers and local talk radio, are criticizing a 15-year-old girl
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.580]  for defending herself with a firearm in her own house.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.900]  Now, that's all coming up.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.980]  The big story, of course, is the ongoing latest developments in machinations
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.660]  with Iran. It's all coming up, but right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.060]  Jonathan in Kansas says he disagrees.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.020]  So we'll go to him first, then Chad, Laura, Dan and others.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.700]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.420]  Yes, Alex, what I disagree, it's not like a big disagreement.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:12.300]  It's actually like the specifics, like you had one day, you had that one woman to talk
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.020]  about the bioweapons facilities and whatnot, and you said he was in Missouri.
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:20.940]  It's actually in Kansas, it's in northeastern Kansas.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:26.620]  And what's interesting is, the reason they put it in was basically to fight against
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.700]  diseases with animals.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.940]  Okay, sir, there's over 200 BioShield bases in the US.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.660]  They're all over the state of Kansas and Missouri.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.380]  And of course, under BioShield, they claim it's to fight against diseases.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.820]  But even in the New York Times and Washington Post, they say, why are they making new weaponized
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:52.540]  things? It's been well known that it's illegal to have a bioweapons program.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:58.540]  So the people that run the US do it under the guise of fighting bioweapons.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.900]  It's always been a fraud.
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.860]  I wasn't disagreeing with what your analysis is.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:10.860]  My point was, the reason why specifically they put that there is, let's say, something
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:16.540]  releases in Kansas, one of the main things is cattle.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:22.380]  And cattle were ranked seventh in cattle production and meat and beef.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:29.020]  So if one of those diseases gets released, they can wipe out the food supply.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:33.980]  Oh yeah, they were gonna have drills with the original equipment used to kill millions
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:38.140]  of cows and sheep in England in the weaponized foot and mouth outbreak that it was later
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.740]  admitted the government released.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:43.260]  They claimed a terrorist and the government must have done it, but nobody got caught.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.620]  In a couple day period, it popped up in hundreds of spots around the country.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.940]  It had been pre-planted everywhere, and the government used it as a huge power grab.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:59.660]  They were gonna come to Texas and other states, that was a big brouhaha, and do drills for
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.100]  foot and mouth with the very equipment used to kill the cattle.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.340]  And of course, bring the foot and mouth here, it's all just part of insanity.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.140]  But I mean, what do you disagree with then?
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:18.220]  Well, that was one thing, but the other thing was about 9-11, the plan of, what do you call
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.940]  it, Operation Northwood is actually older than that.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:26.220]  If you look at Operation Anvil, one of the Kennedys died in that operation, and that's
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:31.500]  when they had drone planes, they were testing that since then.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.300]  That's actually older than Operation Northwood.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.980]  Now, I've talked a lot about Joe Kennedy Jr. dying, and he was flying a one-man aircraft
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:50.220]  behind, I believe it was a Liberator loaded with explosives as a unmanned drone.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.700]  And they don't know what happened to him, they think the Germans shot him down.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:02.620]  But yeah, that was a program, but Northwoods itself is a plan from 1962 to stage terror
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.660]  attacks in America and blame it on Cuba and the Soviets.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.620]  And it was green-lined, so I don't think we disagree, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.620]  Every time they have a police state military checkpoint, they say, this is the first time
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.780]  we've done this, your town is very special.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:23.500]  They found that psychologically, they say it's the first time that locals feel honored
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:23.980]  somehow.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.540]  It's the first time we've stuck you in a meat grinder, but it's never the first time.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.300]  Even when they've done it repeatedly, it's always the first time, it's always, we're
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:37.340]  putting this in Kansas to keep you safe, in case there's a bioweapon release to protect
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.180]  your livestock in this area.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:47.180]  The facilities of the threat, they put a level four in the University of Texas facility in
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:51.100]  Galveston that got wrecked in a hurricane a few years ago.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.780]  They're putting level fours in level two facilities, they're putting the most deadly
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.500]  stuff in the world in tin cans.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.780]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:05.660]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:06.220]  risk.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.980]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:12.220]  The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:17.020]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:23.420]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.020]  or antibacterials.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:30.700]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.100]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.540]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.380]  to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:46.540]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.100]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.100]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.620]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.780]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.580]  or gold?
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.260]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.180]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:15.660]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.460]  seeds.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.100]  They created a new solution for the Arctic Circle.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.740]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:29.180]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.780]  food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.900]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:36.220]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.540]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.820]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:48.540]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.460]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:57.260]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.820]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:05.660]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:10.220]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.060]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.740]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.500]  My name is Mario Sifaldi, and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:25.020]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:29.820]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:32.460]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:39.660]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.620]  digestive system.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.700]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:51.740]  At www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.740]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.580]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:04.140]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:07.100]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:12.700]  Okay, so there's a Google employee.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:18.300]  They're busy starting revolutions all over the world, connected to creating a plan to
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:23.660]  dress up people like members of the Ku Klux Klan and have them go out and support Ron
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.500]  Paul as a way to destroy him.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.900]  I'm going to get Paul Watson and our reporters to tie this in to the entire history of this
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.740]  that's gone on before.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.900]  There's an article out of Enron News that breaks it down and actually has a photo of
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.380]  the guy.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:44.060]  Paul Hayter's caught planning to dress up as KKK poses Paul supporters.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:49.500]  So we're going to definitely get our own report on that out because our report is going to
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:55.500]  tie in to the fact that folks connected to the Democrat that Rand Paul ran against in
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.260]  Kentucky.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.540]  They got caught doing similar things.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:04.700]  So we're going to get a report out on that right now.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.380]  I also, after I take some more calls, want to get into human blunders seen at the heart
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.060]  of Italy ship disaster.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:18.140]  Every time a ship runs aground, every time there's a disaster, a Katrina, the government
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.660]  can't and won't help you.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.700]  And then comes in to the high and dry areas in Katrina and takes people's firearms.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:32.540]  Over and over and over again.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.060]  And so why do you think government can protect you?
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:43.660]  And then the people at the top of government are a bunch of anti-human eugenicist funded
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:50.380]  and financed by a bunch of predatory parasitic finance oligarch Ponzi scheme, fiat currency,
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.300]  derivative selling scam artist.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.740]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.540]  I'm getting to all of it in the Iran news.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:00.940]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to Laura in Minnesota.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:01.740]  You're on the air, Laura.
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:03.740]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:09.180]  I just wanted to thank you for your patriotism because it's just incredible the work that
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.500]  you're doing and just a sincere thank you.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.540]  Well, thank you.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:21.500]  Alex, I do believe that the new world order or whoever these powers will use the hysteria
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.940]  and the hype and the media for 2012 to stage a false flag attack.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:36.380]  I think they actually may even use a big venue, God forbid, but there's an Illuminati card
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.300]  out that shows Big Ben being destroyed.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:45.100]  And we know the Olympics star in London this year that that could set off.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:51.100]  By the way, if we have new listeners, the guy that came up with the Illuminati cards
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:56.860]  in the early 90s has basically everything that's happened happened in the cards.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.700]  And it's really creepy.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:01.820]  We've done special reports on that and he lives in Austin.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.060]  And I know we called like a year ago to get him on.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.460]  They said, well, he's out of town for a month to call back then.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.140]  I want to get that guy on.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.860]  I absolutely want to get the maker of the Illuminati cards.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.700]  He has a video game company here in Austin.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.860]  I want to, yeah, we'll go after him.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.540]  I want him or I want to go over to his office and bang on the door and demand to talk to
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.100]  him.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.540]  I mean, he lives here in Austin.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.260]  I've had enough of this.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.700]  He's coming on or we're going over there.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.380]  I'm sorry, man.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:26.700]  Go ahead.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.340]  I just wanted to fill in what you were talking about for new listeners.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.100]  Right.
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:38.380]  So I would see that as a world stage where they could have this attack orchestrated.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:45.100]  And yet then as they've already circled the wagons around us with this defense authorization
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:50.620]  bill and all these FEMA caps and everything and use the hysteria and use all of this.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.740]  And so it wouldn't necessarily be the end of the world, but it would certainly be the
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:54.940]  end of the world as we know it.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:03.580]  On top of that, as a Christian, we know that there's prophetic events that could be coming
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.540]  as well.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:11.740]  And if you take that as well as what could happen with these false flag attacks, it could
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.900]  be such a mess that they would declare martial law.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:18.140]  And, you know, they've already said that Obama needs something like that in order to get
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:21.980]  a second term, needs some kind of attack or something like that.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:27.580]  So he could eventually declare martial law and there might not even be an election.
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.780]  Well, any of that is possible.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:37.340]  And again, I'm not saying 2012 won't be a wild year with Iran war talk, the economy
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.300]  melting down.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.860]  But the globalists have planned for a long time right around this period to have a lot
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.300]  of craziness go on.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.420]  And so they're again, they plan on saying it's the end of the world.
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:51.180]  So people go along with whatever happens and feel powerless.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.700]  I mean, do you get my angle on that?
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.140]  I do, and I think that they are going to use it.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:02.780]  I just it's too good of an opportunity for them to not play the people and to not use
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.460]  the hysteria and they're just going to take advantage of it.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.180]  I tend to agree with you.
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.780]  It's going to be a crazy year.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.820]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:12.860]  Thank you so much, Laura.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.820]  Appreciate that call.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.620]  Dan in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.580]  Thanks for holding as well.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.180]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.740]  I just wanted to kind of give you a news tip.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:28.620]  You probably already know stuff like this, but I'm in Tampa and I went out hunting in
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.540]  a remote area with a friend of my stepdad who's a Tampa police officer.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:39.580]  And he said that his superiors told him to get out to make sure that all of his family
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:44.540]  and everybody that they knew were out of the city August 27th through the 30th.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:49.020]  And that extremist groups like Anonymous were going to hack the police communication system
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.060]  so that the police couldn't respond to crime.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:57.740]  And then Anonymous and other groups are going to commit senseless acts like dropping bricks
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.020]  on cars from overpasses.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.180]  All right, let me get those dates again.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.060]  What did this senior police officer tell you?
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:13.580]  He told me that his superiors said to them during the Republican National Convention.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.940]  Now, he didn't tell me the dates.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:19.500]  I just know the dates of the Republican National Convention, August 27th or the 30th.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.540]  He told them, make sure that the family and nobody is near the city of Tampa during that
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:24.780]  time.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.220]  Well, no, I didn't know about that.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.900]  But again, this is how mindless this gets.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.900]  And I want to explain this as simply as I can.
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.100]  And I know some people do understand what I'm saying.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.940]  They just act like they don't to be trolls.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:53.020]  But take Anonymous or take something like people wearing Guy Fawkes mask or take Occupy
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.580]  Wall Street.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:59.420]  These are always either things that come from individual activists that get picked up and
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:06.620]  become popularized or they're issues put out by the Ford Foundation, George Soros, i.e.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.020]  Occupy Wall Street, that's completely nebulous.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.500]  We're mad at Wall Street, which is a generalization.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.060]  Then it turns out the big banks are actually financing it directly through Soros and others
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:25.580]  on record to demonize the rest of Wall Street and the rest of the free market.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:30.060]  So it takes the blame and so the big mega banks hooked up with government can come in
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:35.580]  with regulators backed up by the dumbed down mass that doesn't know what's going on and
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.620]  take over what's left of the free market, which was never the problem.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.780]  It was crony insiders that did it.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:49.340]  Then when you criticize Occupy as, just come protest, we don't know what about, then the
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:57.180]  operators can come in from Soros and Ford Foundation, take it over and then basically
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.580]  hijack a revolution they know is already coming.
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:05.100]  They kind of predetonate revolutions before they get there so they can steer them and
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:05.740]  misdirect them.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.020]  It's like Red Adair blowing up a oil well with dynamite.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:12.460]  It's a controlled explosion and this gets into the social engineering and they write
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:13.740]  white papers on it.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.180]  Now it's the same thing with Anonymous.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.100]  Anonymous attacks Ron Paul.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:25.420]  Anonymous says they were gonna hack show that the votes can all be counted in Iowa in secret.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.340]  It turned out there was fraud in Iowa and it was admitted on Fox News that, well, we
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.180]  had a gentleman's agreement cuz all these key districts didn't come in and we just made
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.740]  Santorum second place instead of Ron Paul.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:40.780]  And it's just in your face, but because it's a little complex, the public just kind of
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:46.620]  tunes out because they're trained to just receive data, not to learn the fun of actually
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.500]  being informed.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.580]  People think thinking is hard.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.340]  No, not thinking is hard.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:51.980]  It's dull.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.580]  So it's the same issue, sir.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:05.100]  I mean, Anonymous, just to finish, is just this giant cutout that then Homeland Security
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:10.060]  and others who've been caught doing this can cyber attack their own systems to then have
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.980]  an excuse to come in and take over the Internet, pass the SOPA bill.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.580]  Israel's being hacked right now.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:20.780]  The government used the Stuxnet last year to call for Internet censorship when the government
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.860]  admits they launched Stuxnet.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:28.860]  So again, only a dumbed down public, think of the disdain the system has, that they would
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:35.900]  say Israel and the US launched Stuxnet and six months later, we gotta take your rights
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.060]  cuz of Stuxnet, a terrorist launched it.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.220]  I mean, I'm sorry, sir, go ahead and make a point.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:40.700]  No, no.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.220]  Yeah, I was just going to say, I mean, it was completely obvious to me that they were
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.460]  sort of, you know, creating this hysteria.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.580]  And of course, they'll use it as a pretext for something.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:54.060]  But I was going to say one thing further that, you know, just for the new listeners out there,
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:57.820]  because I remember once upon a time I was and I doubted some of the things that you
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:02.300]  said, you know, obviously I still check, you know, on some of the stuff you say, but his
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:07.980]  superiors told, they told all the officers not to go on any, quote unquote, extremist
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.140]  website or the government will be, quote, in your computer.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:16.860]  You know, I mean, they're creating this whole hysteria and they're, you know, obviously
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.060]  they're trying to get the police on.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.980]  Well, that's even bigger news than they're going to have anonymous.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.220]  Look, this is so important.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.500]  It's in my film, The Takeover.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:32.620]  The government on record with foundations hired about 100 anarchists, flew them in by
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.820]  aircraft and allowed them to demolish everything.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:37.660]  And the cops were told to stand down.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.180]  This was in the local newspapers.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.580]  And then two days after that, the media is like, why don't you do something?
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.780]  And so they attack the peaceful crowds, including men, women and children.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:51.580]  I mean, they play police like you're leading a two year old off the side of a cliff.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.860]  I mean, cops, you got to be smarter than this, where they sit there and they tell them Anonymous
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:58.060]  is going to attack.
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.460]  So you don't visit sites.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.540]  That's saying we don't trust you.
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.100]  You're bad.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.700]  No, we don't want you to know.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:10.940]  I mean, cops have got to be smarter than that, that the system is afraid of police waking
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:11.340]  up.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:15.260]  I mean, does your friend that you were hunting with, does he buy this?
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.180]  You know, Alex, I tried to talk to him and tried to educate him.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:23.580]  It's, you know, it's somebody who's never really seen the other side of this or really
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.860]  can't see through the matrix.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.780]  And, you know, it was very difficult.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.340]  So I don't know.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.820]  And so he thinks he thinks he better not visit sites or the government will be in his computer
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:34.860]  without a warrant.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.340]  And he thinks having his Fourth Amendment violated is a good thing.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:41.420]  Well, on his computer, I brought up your website and showed him the NDAA.
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.420]  So he's he's probably on the list already.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:49.900]  But we're all on. Listen, they can't get all of us unless we get scared and give in to
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.140]  them.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.220]  Was there anything else he had that you want to point out?
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:53.580]  No, no.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.540]  But I just wanted to say I'm going to work early voting for Ron Paul.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.180]  Guys, get out there and volunteer at local campaigns.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:19:59.740]  Well said.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.220]  Well said.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:07.260]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.060]  back on?
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:12.060]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.340]  never been a better time.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.820]  To get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:16.860]  Here's why.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:21.580]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.020]  of our oldest sponsors.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:27.820]  Their emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.780]  Unlike gas generators, the solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.220]  electricity from the sun.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:38.060]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:42.620]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.060]  power outages again.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:48.380]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:49.660]  Solutions from Science.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.620]  Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.820]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.500]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.460]  This time warns of Greek style US debt crises.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.420]  You heard me right.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:12.220]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the US economy, its debt and the current Greek
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.580]  economic meltdown.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:18.860]  With the debt to GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.860]  rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.220]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:28.140]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must read
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.420]  for every American.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:34.780]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:37.180]  interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:41.260]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:47.100]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:53.340]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.820]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.020]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:04.620]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.740]  That bears repeating.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:09.580]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:14.140]  And ProEM-1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:19.500]  ProEM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:19.980]  day.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:24.940]  ProEM-1 is dairy, wheat and soy free, contains all natural and certified organic ingredients,
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:29.180]  contains no preservatives or animal products, supports a healthy digestive and immune system,
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:33.020]  supports weight loss, improves absorption of food nutrients, aids in controlling yeast
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:37.980]  infections, is never freeze dried and uses three groups of live viable beneficial microbes
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:39.500]  to cleanse and remove toxins.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:43.260]  Order ProEM-1 daily probiotic cleanse at teraganix.com.
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.180]  Spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X.com.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.620]  Teraganix.com.
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:52.780]  Or call toll free, 866-369-3678.
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:56.300]  That's 866-369-3678.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.540]  ProEM-1, the raw probiotic.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:03.180]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid?
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.460]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off of your teeth both as a
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.700]  vapor and as particles into your body?
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.380]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.820]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:21.260]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:25.900]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:30.140]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body to produce
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.060]  glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass fed cows.
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:39.740]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured,
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.820]  the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful,
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:46.780]  in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.300]  It is One World Whey.
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.020]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.740]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.220]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:59.340]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:05.100]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.100]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:29.500]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.100]  You know, I try to cover stuff in a simple way sometimes and I tend to not do it.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:38.140]  But the point is, anytime something's anonymous and people are wearing masks,
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.860]  that's perfect for government infiltration.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.820]  Or anytime there's no leadership of something.
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:48.540]  And anytime the ideas of an organization aren't openly available,
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:52.060]  that's where you find globalist infiltration.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:58.300]  If it's some militia wants to meet with you in camo, but they won't tell you their names.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.740]  It's feds, folks.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:09.100]  If people are saying something's anonymous, it's the feds looking for morons that they can set up.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.380]  Looking for people.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.540]  I mean, I can't tell you how many cases I've seen.
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:17.180]  Even the Washington Post and others have admitted this goes on.
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:23.900]  Where the government goes and gets ex-prisoners who were forced to join Islam or whatever in prison.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:28.140]  Or be gang raped, basically, because if you're not part of one of the gangs,
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:31.260]  you're not part of one of the gangs, well, you know what happens to you.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.700]  And normally, it's always the same story.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:44.620]  Single parent family, 78 IQ, mildly retarded, poor person, serious handicaps,
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.020]  whatever the case is, mental disabilities.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.300]  And you hear on the news, they were planning to wage war against America.
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:53.340]  And it's just a complete cut out.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:58.700]  And I couldn't imagine being a police officer and being told, watch what websites you go to,
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.220]  cuz the government's watching you.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.860]  That's the tyranny right there.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.300]  I remember ten years ago, they'll never secretly arrest citizens.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.860]  Now they're on the news going, we will kill you.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.820]  We won't just arrest you, we'll kill you without a warrant.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.660]  They're overthrowing all of the checks and balances.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.180]  For a reason.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:25.420]  For a reason, that's another big question I should throw out to listeners.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.340]  Why do you think they're overthrowing the Bill of Rights and Constitution right now?
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.660]  And if we don't need it, if it's such a bad thing, why did we have it before?
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.540]  Well, the answer is they're getting ready to bring us into a full depression
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.820]  and rob everybody blind.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.860]  The depression is the plan.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.020]  The people running the society want the depression to consolidate control.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.620]  They're not screwing things up.
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.540]  They're not incompetent idiots.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.060]  They know what they're doing.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.420]  It's all public.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.940]  They're consolidating control.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:02.300]  If you don't go along with their program, and if they don't think they can carry out
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.340]  the next phase of this, they'll back off and wait for us to go back to sleep.
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.820]  But now they figured out that's not gonna happen, so they're accelerating it.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.500]  It looks like even though we're waking up, and that's why the big confrontation is on.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.300]  This is an incredible time to be alive right now.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.460]  And every person you wake up is key.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.260]  They're telling cops, don't visit alternative websites,
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:27.020]  cuz they're scared they're gonna wake up.
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:34.140]  They're scared they're gonna go to infoawars.com, where we collate the New York Times,
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:38.780]  the Chicago Tribune, the El Paso Times, and then our article from eight months before.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.980]  Like look, we told you the government's shipping in narcotics and laundering hundreds of billions.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.220]  Here's our report, exactly the same group.
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:50.380]  Now here they are, eight months later, forced to report what we told you.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.100]  They're afraid of the incredible credibility.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.900]  They're afraid of the fact that I know they're criminals at the top,
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.300]  that you know, and that they're gonna know.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.220]  Nick in Brooklyn, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.780]  Alejandro Revere, how are you, my friend?
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.260]  Hey, I like that, Alejandro Revere, good, my friend.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.700]  I've been practicing that for quite a while.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.300]  Alex, it's great to talk to you. I just wanna tell you how thankful and grateful,
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:22.460]  and I'm sure I speak for a whole lot of people, particularly in Brooklyn and Manhattan,
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.500]  New York, wherever, that thank you for all the work that you're doing
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.620]  and for getting this information out there.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.780]  Alex, I wanted to touch on a point. First of all,
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:36.780]  I just wanted to say that I love Ron Paul. I absolutely love the man,
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.420]  and the establishment media is absolutely ignoring him.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:42.860]  They are working overtime.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:49.740]  They are running around like insane piranhas on methamphetamine and PCP attacking him.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:55.900]  Absolutely, and they can't, you know, it amazes me because they have nothing
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:01.180]  that they can grab on to except some letters that they say he signed,
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:05.660]  and some have these letters and calling him a racist and all that.
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:14.060]  But yet they ignore the fact that his ideas transcend everything that has to do with race,
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.980]  just every spectrum across the board. Because if we don't have liberty in order to be able to
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:25.260]  share our ideas or share whatever it is that we may believe, we don't have that.
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.140]  And that resonates-
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.700]  I tell you what, stay there. You're on a roll. I want you to be able to finish
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:33.740]  cuz I interrupted you. Exactly, Ron Paul is completely about who you are,
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:39.020]  not what color you are or where you came from. I mean, the system that claims they're fighting
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:44.860]  racism, that's all they obsess on all day, and then they make that people's entire world.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.260]  Ron Paul is about the end of all of that. Stay there. I'll come right back to you, Nick.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:57.020]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:30:05.260]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are? A decade into the 21st century,
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:09.420]  record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:14.140]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off and placing your child's name
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:19.260]  on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:25.580]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control? The fact is, in all this craziness,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:30.700]  there's only one thing you can control, your greatest dependency, your food supply.

[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:13.100]  road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing Diamond Gussets.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:22.700]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make Blue Diamond Gusset jeans. They sew pride
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:32.940]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch

[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:11.420]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:16.460]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:22.460]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps

[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:43.820]  All right, let's go back to Nick and Brooklyn. Start over,
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.140]  Nick, with your point about Ron Paul. Go ahead.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:53.900]  Basically, what I'm trying to say is that every morning I get up and I go through the rigors of
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.060]  what we all get, you know, Gary for work, all that stuff. You turn on the TV to find out the
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:03.340]  weather and of course they roll by what's been happening in the campaigns. And we realize that
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:09.260]  they have everybody up there, okay? Even the janitor who was cleaning up where they had the
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:14.060]  debates except Ron Paul. And I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute, you know, here's a candidate
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:19.900]  who actually has something to say, who doesn't need a teleprompter, who's able to pinpoint the
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:26.620]  exact problems that this country is facing right at this pivotal moment. And they don't show him,
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.620]  they don't speak, it's like he doesn't exist.
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:33.980]  And I'll tell you what this is, this is a coming of age though,
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:38.620]  because just when you think you know how corrupt the system is and the establishment is,
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:45.660]  you get slapped in the face with no. It's only when their facade really starts getting exposed
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:53.500]  that they really show you that it's beyond bias. It is a total arrogance, but more than that, a fear
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:35:00.220]  that you'll discover the monopoly that they're running over our society and that they don't want
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:07.500]  you making decisions. And when Ron Paul, the only non puppet candidate stands up, it calls
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:13.820]  their entire bluff. He exposes the little man behind the curtain, the Wizard of Oz,
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:19.660]  the great and powerful Oz, and they cannot allow him to win.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:25.500]  So they will cheat, they will steal, they will manipulate, they will give him 89 seconds,
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:29.420]  they'll block him out. And when they're forced to talk about him, they'll say he can't win.
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:35.420]  And that's why Ron Paul basically was giddy when he came in second place in New Hampshire,
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:40.140]  was he pointed out he's winning just by exposing what a bunch of crooks they are.
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:44.860]  The system is really destroying its capital. In fact, I saw a Crowdhammer
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:53.500]  article out of the Chicago Tribune I was gonna mention, where he's so angry that Ron Paul
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.500]  won't go away. In fact, here it is, Ron Paul is not going to go away.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:04.540]  And he goes on to break down the fact that whether they like it or not, the system is in trouble.
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.660]  Again, they were able to block him out before, but because he understands history
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:16.540]  and he keeps coming, they don't know what to do. Look, they've got a 9% approval rating.
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:20.140]  Can you imagine the horrible job of the dinosaur mainstream media?
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:27.100]  No matter how expensive their sets, how fancy their outfits, how authoritatively they speak,
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.780]  even if you've got a gold water hose spewing rotten water out, nobody's gonna wanna drink
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:36.620]  out of it. They're gonna wanna drink out of the old rubber hose that's got good clean water
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:42.380]  coming out of it. And so they've got a gold water hose into a cesspit, into a porta-potty
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:48.460]  with brown sludge shooting out, telling us to take a drink, and their numbers are folding.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:55.100]  For a decade, their numbers have been dissipating, but now the last bit of water is going around the
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:58.940]  toilet bowl there. It's about to make the sound that all the water has been exhausted,
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:04.220]  and they realize it. And so we're now at that critical juncture.
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:09.660]  What is this ruling class and all of their minions, and all of their court gestures,
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:14.460]  and all their little pimps, and sellouts, and whores? What are they going to do
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:18.460]  as their system comes down? Well, they're gonna try to bring in tyranny.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.420]  They're gonna try to launch wars. They're gonna stage terror attacks,
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.300]  because it's about tens of trillions of dollars. It's about social control.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.700]  It's about staying on top. And more importantly, it's about not going to jail.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:36.780]  If we actually ever take the government back, the crimes are going to be so legion
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:41.500]  and so huge that we can't give the globalists an amnesty.
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:46.220]  We can't say, okay, just go away. They're too well dug in. We're going to have to send
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:53.020]  the entire super class that's committed crimes to prison. It's about 6,000 of them.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:57.180]  And those that were directly involved in killing innocents are gonna have to be brought up on
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:02.460]  murder charges, capital premeditated murder charges. And they're gonna have to be brought
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:07.900]  to justice. You have to teach people like this a lesson. I'm not risking my life, my treasure,
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:11.580]  my name to just sit up here and play patty cake with these people.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:16.620]  When we get this country back, these people will be brought to justice and they know it.
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.780]  They know it. And they understand it. They understand it's for everything. I'm fighting
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:24.940]  for my life. They're fighting for theirs, okay? Just like Mussolini and Hitler.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:29.420]  They know we're coming for them and they know we're not gonna back off, but it doesn't matter.
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:37.100]  They are culturally and socially dying now. They have a 9% approval rating. Can you imagine, Nick,
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:42.780]  the job they've got trying to, you've heard the saying put perfume on a pig.
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:47.580]  This isn't putting perfume on a pig. This is putting perfume on a
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:58.460]  latrine. I mean, you cannot do it. There is no going back. There is no way out for them.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:02.540]  I've looked at every angle. I mean, look, and by the way, you globalist out there and all your
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:06.460]  minions and servants, those of you that are mid-level, this new order is gonna be worse
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:12.220]  for you if it succeeds. It's so horrible. You better hope those of us that have
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:19.100]  sanity are able to eradicate this cancer that's going into stage four. You better hope that you
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:23.660]  didn't study history. You see, that's the problem. They didn't study history. Go ahead and finish up,
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.500]  Nick. Yes, Al, I just wanted to bring up one more point with you.
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:35.020]  A couple of years ago, there was a gentleman by the name of George Galloway. And you interviewed
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:41.500]  him back in 07. I was online and I was looking at some of the stuff that you guys went over
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:45.740]  on that interview. But the reason that I bring him up is because I was really, really impressed
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:53.340]  at the fact that Mr. Galloway went to work on the Congress during the last administration
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:40:01.580]  and the whole cover-up, the whole Oil for Food program, that whole scenario. And so he's got
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:07.740]  somewhat of a little show that he has where he broadcasts directly here into the New York City
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:15.100]  area and over from where he's at in England. And, you know, I called him up because I realized that
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:22.540]  his position on Ron Paul was somewhat shrewd. And so, you know, I call him up and I say to him,
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:29.820]  I say to him, Mr. Galloway, listen, you know, what exactly is it about Ron Paul that you don't like
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:36.060]  and the fact that you would rather take Obama over? I mean, do you realize that under this
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:41.660]  administration, the NDAA Act has been passed? I mean, it's a done deal. Are you familiar with
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:46.220]  the fall of the republic? Are you familiar with the Obama deception? I mean, it lays it out there
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:51.100]  very, very clearly for us exactly what this administration is about. But he would rather
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:58.060]  take this administration over any of the other dwarves that he calls them and any of the other
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:04.780]  dwarves that he calls them. And, you know, I was somewhat offended at that. So the reason I bring
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.900]  him up is because I realized that his whole position against the war at the time and everything
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:14.460]  that took place, he was very, very against it. And so this is exactly Ron Paul's platform. He's
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:18.140]  against the wars. Yeah, but here's the deal with Galloway and I would have him back on the show.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:23.100]  We've asked him a few times. He hasn't responded. I know he's very busy. Is he is pretty much a
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:30.540]  socialist and they would rather have their big corporate socialism that Obama will give them
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:37.900]  and go ahead and have some big wars than give up the socialist idea. I mean, Ron Paul is a
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:45.100]  revolutionary. The idea of local control, the idea of small government when we're so addicted and
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:49.980]  look, it gets worse and worse, but it's the devil we know. So a lot of people are scared to get out
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:53.500]  of that. I appreciate your call. Great points. Let's try to move really quick here because I'm
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:42:01.980]  gonna start getting into some news. Alexion in Oregon, you're on the air. Alex, good day, sir.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:09.180]  Hey, buddy. Hey, winners, Fox News propaganda agents. Number one in slander, Bill O'Reilly.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:17.100]  You are a coward, sir. And to the horror media, 50 pentagons all in a row, 50 prisons that keep us
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:23.100]  in tow, 50 wardens with many black, 50 flags now on a stack. 50 years have now gone by,
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:29.900]  50 years of many lies, vicious lies. 50 trillion is not enough. 50 trillion, it's all their stuff.
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:35.100]  50 billion is the goal. 50 billion poor lost souls. 50 million will stand and roar.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:42.380]  50 million pissed off poor. We're keeping score. God help us all, Alex.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:47.020]  I appreciate your call. The Pentagon actually gets around 2 trillion a year.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:53.340]  But you never hear about cutting that welfare and those $800 toilet seats and $500 hammers
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.500]  or the $15 million blue tarps that cost $100 for Halliburton.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:06.620]  But again, back during the no bid contracts in 04, 05, 06, they would have newscast on CNN,
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:13.260]  you name it, saying, how dare people say there should be foreign companies allowed to bid
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:20.220]  on these contracts? That was a straw man. It wasn't foreign companies, it was that there
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:24.220]  were no bid contracts being given to domestic and foreign companies.
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:29.740]  So instead of saying, why is Halliburton that's moved to Dubai? Why are they getting no bid
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:35.020]  contracts that other companies are? They just spun and said, well, of course American companies
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:38.460]  are getting the bids. We're not gonna give it to foreigners. So the average good old boy would say,
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:41.340]  well, that's reasonable, give it to American companies.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:44.860]  American companies, but it wasn't an issue of that. Again, it's such
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:50.700]  blatant deception. And it's only when they're really desperate. That's why they love to talk
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:54.540]  about your favorite cake or your favorite color or your favorite music, because then they don't
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:59.660]  have to lie as much. They get to tell the truth because it's about an inconsequential issue.
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.100]  But genuinely,
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:08.060]  genuinely promoting things they do not engage in.
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:15.180]  Generally, almost everything you see in mainstream media is spun or twisted
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:21.660]  or lies by omission. And that's why we shouldn't even call it mainstream media. Even that term,
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:30.220]  mainstream media. These are global corporations themselves owned by the big megabanks that took
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:35.180]  over the planet through fraudulent derivatives and Ponzi schemes that would make Bernie Madoff
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:45.100]  blush and Ken Lay shake with blushing. They've got all of this going on.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:50.780]  All of this corruption, all of these agendas they're selling,
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:58.380]  and we still call it mainstream media. No, it's agenda media. It's bought and paid for media.
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:03.900]  I mean, I wear on my sleeve what I support. I wear on my sleeve what I stand for.
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.980]  I wear on my sleeve who my sponsors are. Here's an example. Tyrell Ventura, Jesse Ventura's son
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:14.620]  called me Saturday when I was out with the family Saturday evening. And he said, I just noticed
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:20.380]  something that hadn't been pointed out anywhere. The publisher, and I went and looked it up when
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:27.260]  I got home that night, it was true. The publisher of that Navy SEAL, legendary Navy SEAL that killed
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:31.820]  the most people, which he himself says really isn't true. That's the title they gave it.
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:38.300]  That's the title they gave it. And that we saw all over every Fox show, Fox Radio, Fox TV defaming
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:45.820]  Ventura. News Corps that owns Fox published it. They didn't disclose, by the way, this is our
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:52.460]  product whenever they had him on all the shows. And I should have known that. It was an infomercial.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:58.540]  And to get sales up, they said he knocked him out in the bar in front of everybody.
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:04.140]  And now they say, it happened out on the sidewalk. And well, maybe there aren't witnesses now.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:10.300]  And I can tell you Ventura is taking legal action. I'm not supposed to get any more than that.
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:16.780]  Didn't happen, just like he wasn't driving recklessly in California when he was in Minnesota.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:20.860]  And folks, they could do anything. They could pull me over today, throw a bag of drugs in
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:34.380]  the back of my car. Say I resist, knock me on the head. You can even have a good police chief,
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:36.860]  and I don't know if our police chief's a good man or a bad man.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:44.380]  He claims he's a good guy. But in a lot of cities, it's come out that the feds and private
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:50.300]  corporations will actually have units of cops who actually work for them. It's come out the CIA
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:55.100]  since the 50s has had units of police on any major police department. I'm talking about
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:58.300]  police departments of more than just a couple hundred officers.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:05.820]  But you know what, I've gotta just deal with that. I've gotta just deal with it,
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:12.460]  and that's the way it is. Because the rot has gotten so bad, somebody has gotta stand up against
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:16.860]  it. Okay, I'm gonna go to break, and I'm gonna come back and hit the Iran news. There's been
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:22.700]  some new developments on that. I wanna get some into how the government can and won't protect you
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:27.660]  and tie the sinking of that ship off the coast of Italy by the now the reportedly drunk captain
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:33.660]  with criticism of a 15-year-old girl in her own home that defended herself with a firearm
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:34.620]  from two burglars.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:41.020]  She's being criticized in Texas. I mean, and again, it's over the top,
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:45.020]  but when people are peer pressure driven, even in a state of freedom like Texas,
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:50.060]  where we're all about being an individualist and everything. Enough people hear the local talk show
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:54.140]  host, like I did on conservative radio this morning, saying she shouldn't have had a gun
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:57.660]  at 15. It was her dad's gun, and she shouldn't have access to it.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:03.740]  I heard about half the callers driving to work agreeing. See, it's this weird peer pressure
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:09.580]  thing that if the authority figure says something, we agree with it. Well, what if the authority
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:17.980]  figures bought off trader? I mean, I remember my parents warning me growing up, saying son,
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:26.540]  you're gonna run into friends that aren't really your friends, and they're under peer pressure,
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:29.740]  gonna try to get you to do bad things, and don't do it.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:36.620]  And I didn't do too much bad stuff. But still, and now with my children, I try to explain to
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:40.940]  them constantly about the company you keep, and who you're around, and peer pressure.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:51.740]  And we have got ruthless criminals with a high tech PR machine running our society, and only
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:56.700]  people living in a dream world would deny this. Everybody knows we're going in the wrong direction,
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.460]  and it's moving quicker in the wrong direction.
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:06.220]  Speaking of sponsorship, I won't make three or $4 million lying about Jesse Ventura
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:13.100]  here defaming him so I can make some money. But what I will do is have sponsors and products
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:19.980]  that I believe in that also fund our operation. So if you wanna support the show, go to infoawards.com.

[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:50.940]  book about education. All of it, I'm still running the Everything Special,
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:55.020]  70 plus percent off on all my films, 18 films on DVD for 99.95.

[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:17.980]  I did a lot of research, as you know, six months or so ago to find the very best company that has
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:24.940]  the full spectrum of super high quality mineral, vitamin drinks, weight loss, everything. It's
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:28.060]  thousands of products. This is one of the biggest companies in the US,
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:31.740]  Young Jevity, and that's who I've teamed up with. You can go to infoawardsteam.com,
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:36.140]  get the Tangy Tangerine, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the Pollen Burst, the Rebound,
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:41.340]  Citrus Punch, and there's nothing like it. I mean, look, I'd buy stuff out of a store.
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:46.940]  I'd become a distributor of stuff and sell it myself. That's what I chose, it's the best,
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:56.380]  infoawardsteam.com. I've now lost over 30 pounds in six weeks. And you just, well,

[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:35.980]  All right. Going back into the news here, I just wanna finish up on the longevity products.
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:42.140]  It was actually about a year ago that I signed up and said I was gonna start promoting it.
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:47.180]  And then I got all the products and started having some guests on to talk about it,
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:51.260]  cuz I'd done the research, but didn't really implement it myself. I did a little bit,
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:58.780]  lost like five pounds, and Aaron Dykes followed it and has lost, I don't know, it's gotta be like 50
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:03.740]  pounds now, it's ridiculous. I mean, he's gone from being overweight like I was to being completely
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:09.420]  skinny now. And it's because you eat neat and eat cuz the food has had the minerals and nutrients
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:19.420]  taken out of it. Most of the soils they're using are depleted. And now I finally, in the last six
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:28.620]  weeks, actually do take the longevity whey powder. I actually do take the mineral and vitamin drinks
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:33.420]  so that I'm not hungry. And it's not that it fills me up calorie-wise, my body doesn't want
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:39.660]  calories, it wants the nutrients. It's so simple. I mean, and by the way, these products have the
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:45.340]  highest scores. The ones I've got on the shopping cart are my favorites, have the highest scores
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:51.740]  out there for vitamins and minerals. And take the pollen burst with all of the B vitamins and
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:56.940]  a bunch of other stuff. The tangent tangerine is just a joke, the 90 plus minerals it's gotten in
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:03.580]  vitamins. I mean, it's amazing. All right, I'm done ranting about that, infowarsteam.com. There's
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:06.700]  also a phone number there if you wanna call and ask any questions on the website.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:11.100]  Okay, getting back into the news here, I've already mentioned some of this,
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:14.060]  but this is our top story yet again. And if we do have war with Iran,
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.220]  you'll find out why it's been our top story for months running.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:23.260]  Big developments in that area. US military chief to Israel as Iran tensions grow, AP reports.
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:31.580]  And the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey has gone there to try to talk Israel out
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:37.980]  of attacking Iran. US Israel have postponed military exercise amid tension with Iran.
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:42.700]  Thousands of US troops have been put into Israel, 15,000 added in Kuwait.
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:48.220]  But they canceled that announcement that they were gonna have the Israeli and US fleets
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:52.140]  steam right in amongst the Iranian fleet. And the Iranians, as you know,
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:55.260]  two weeks ago said, if you do that, this is your last warning.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:01.100]  So it looks like the people running the US and Israel, cuz I don't wanna say it's our governments,
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:06.780]  blinked. And I think the big issue is the Russian foreign minister and the Russian
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:13.260]  deputy prime minister have all come out and said this is an attack on Russia if you attack Syria,
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:20.380]  or if you attack Iran. And of course, Syria is going into a total bedlam and civil war
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:24.220]  because the West has been pumping al-Qaeda by the thousands in.
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:27.420]  I'm no fan of Assad, I don't like dictatorships and big government.
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:33.660]  But our criminal government isn't trying to put freedom in there and I'd be against that
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:39.500]  meddling, it's unconstitutional, but they're trying to put al-Qaeda in. Came out again last
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.980]  week, the State Department's running the Muslim Brotherhood. I mean, these are guys flapping
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:49.420]  burkas on women's heads. I wanna know why all the neocon talk show hosts are saying this is all
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:54.380]  great to go into Libya. They put al-Qaeda in there. You people help get the underwear
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:57.820]  bomber on the plane. It's the Pentagon hanging out with Amor al-Awlaki.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:04.780]  It's NATO putting al-Qaeda in charge of all these countries.
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:08.140]  Imagine the people that say give your rights up or al-Qaeda will get you,
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:14.460]  they're the ones behind al-Qaeda, of course. It's a skeleton key, a Leatherman tool.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:21.260]  It opens every lock, it does everything they need. Eat your vegetables, why? Al-Qaeda will get you.
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.980]  You'll be good or the boogeyman will get you, the al-Qaeda man.
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:31.580]  I got a bunch more on this. US backs off Iran attack, US sends letter to Iran on the Strait
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:35.260]  of Hormuz. It's all coming up, but first I'm gonna get to more of your phone calls.

[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:36.620]  as well concerning the TSA, Iran, you name it. Right now, let's go to
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:42.700]  Nate in New Jersey. Nate, thanks for holding. Welcome.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:49.980]  Hi, Nate. Welcome to the airwaves here. Okay, he's gone. Let's go to the next caller.
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:55.500]  Let's go to Audra in Texas. You're on the air, Audra. Hi, Alex. This is Audra.
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:01.420]  I hope everything's going well for you. I've been watching a lot of the news here lately on the
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:06.940]  enemy expatriation act and kind of monitoring what's going on with Jackson Bannock. I wonder
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:11.980]  if you had any kind of research or any articles you're planning on putting up on that.
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:19.740]  Say that again? The Jackson Bannock Act. Obama's pushing to do away with that act this year.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:24.380]  To show my ignorance, what is the act? I'm sure once I hear about the act,
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:26.220]  I'm just not familiar with the name. I'll know what it is.
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:32.140]  This is an amendment that was passed in 1974 that affects US trade relations with communist
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:36.300]  or communist communist countries. Yes, I knew he was trying to get rid of that, yes.
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:40.220]  Yeah, I didn't know if you had done any work on this or not.
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:45.660]  Does that specifically deal with Cuba? It deals with China, it deals with Russia.
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:52.220]  There's a lot in this act that says, for example, action to address market disruption.
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:56.140]  It's in two parts, and this is in part two. No, but I mean, now that you raise it, yes,
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:02:02.540]  I was aware of the laws barring some of those trade deals. And I haven't covered this enough.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:07.260]  But my problem with all these trade deals, they're always one way. I know the deal he's trying to get
[02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:12.380]  us with South Korea is a total ripoff. I have studied that particular one, but I know I'm not
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:15.660]  really familiar with his latest jockeying. What is Obama doing?
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:21.100]  He just wants to do away with it all together. And the thing that kind of concerns me about that is,
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:26.300]  in part two, it has an action to address market disruption. And he's talking about both sides
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:30.780]  of his neck as usual, where he's talking about he wants to bring jobs home. But according to this
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:36.780]  act, anything that causes market disruption, where it's increased quantities, that kind of
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:40.860]  thing, that can cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:45.900]  He's supposed to go in there and keep that from happening, basically, with this act.
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:50.780]  And clearly, it's not been followed. They haven't been using it. And now he wants to completely get
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:55.660]  rid of it. And the other act that he's got coming up, and I'll make these quick, I know you got
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:59.500]  things to do, but the Enemy Expatriation Act, I have been trying to get that in place-
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:04.060]  Oh, no, no, that's big. I know that that allows them to just take your citizenship away
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:09.420]  extra judicially, and have you disappear as well. Oh, you're not a citizen, so we're shipping you
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:14.700]  to get Mo now. And I've been trying to get people to wake up and pay attention to this stuff. I get
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:20.220]  called patriotic and unpatriotic. And in my assessment of everything, it looks like the
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:24.940]  Christians have dropped the ball. It really does. And I know you can't say that, but I can say that
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:29.980]  as a viewer and a listener, I can say that that's what's happened over these last several decades,
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:34.060]  is we just sit here and complain and just drop the ball, let them have it.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:40.460]  I actually agree with you. Look, to the World Council of Churches and the International Council
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:45.100]  of Churches set up by the Rockefellers, they admittedly have come in and taken over the major
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:50.380]  denominations. So you go to church and you learn how good Bill and Melinda Gates are, and how good
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:55.900]  abortion is, and how taking your vaccines is good. I mean, that's the clergy response teams.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:03.580]  A lot of these churches are actually on government payroll. They use the faith-based
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:08.620]  initiative to fence that money to them. Do you realize how much money these
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:12.780]  churches are going to make once all this hype on 2012, as it gets closer and closer,
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.900]  I mean, the people are going to start packing these churches, and then you've got the other
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:19.740]  side of that coin, where there are people who say, well, you know, according to revelations,
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:23.900]  we're not going to be here. So, you know, we don't have to worry about what's coming.
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:29.740]  But notice that's why in the 60s and 70s, all these different globalist writers push 2012,
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:36.860]  was to get the non-Christians to have their own reason to cop out. And I even know people that
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:41.900]  are agnostics who still believe in 2012, it's more of a superstition. So yeah, it's tailored
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:45.820]  for them to think that there's going to be a rapture, so they have nothing to deal with.
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:51.180]  God bless you. I really appreciate your call. Okay, we're going to go to Rick.
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:56.780]  We're going to go to Brian and Chad and Nate and many others that are holding
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:21.740]  on the other side of this break, and I'm going to cover some news too.
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:33.660]  You can control your greatest dependency, your food supply. Make 2012 the year you take control
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:39.100]  by getting prepared. eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the

[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:05.260]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:10.380]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:15.340]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:20.940]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:25.340]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:30.060]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:34.620]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:39.420]  their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:43.580]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.820]  offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:54.700]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:05.260]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the silver
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:09.420]  lunch generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:13.980]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:19.740]  the lungs. The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.

[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:04.860]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:19.420]  the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:28.140]  Okay, let's rampage through five or six calls right now, and then I really want to get into
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:34.620]  some of the economic news. Also, the CDC increases pressure on parents to
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:41.420]  give children vaccines with deadly toxins in them.
[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:50.700]  We're gonna be going over that coming up. Also up at infoawars.com, Ron Paul,
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:58.140]  Outrageous Overreach of EPA. We've got that report, we're gonna be going over.
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:01.500]  But right now, let's go to Rick in Virginia. Rick, you're on the air.
[02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:10.380]  Yes, how's it going, Alex? I am a military veteran out here in Norfolk, Virginia.
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:16.780]  And I've kind of heard you talk about these past couple days about veterans and the fact that
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:21.660]  nobody's talking about them and stuff. I want to bring up a point to your listeners that should be
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:32.780]  the most in-your-face example that everything that you're talking about is true.
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:37.820]  And that's the fact that 18 military veterans are committing suicide every day.
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:44.860]  And the insane team, I call it the media insane team, talks about
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:55.740]  how 6,000 deaths over the past 10 years over in Iraq and the Middle East,
[02:09:55.740 --> 02:10:03.340]  but they don't talk about the 18 military veterans that die every day under the government's control
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:10.780]  because the VA is part of the federal government. Well, if you do the math, that's 18 times 365.
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:21.100]  That's 6,570 suicides on our own soil every year.
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:29.260]  It times out by 10, the length of the global war on terrorism. That means that 10 times
[02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:41.420]  the amount of deaths are here in America as the entire war on terror over the past 10 years combined.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:46.220]  Well, what you're doing is unpatriotic. According to the media, you're supposed to go to football
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:50.700]  games and thank the troops when they have them stand up and thank them when you see them on
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:55.340]  the street. But you're supposed to thank them for being part of the globalist wars.
[02:10:55.340 --> 02:11:01.660]  Once they've actually been used up, supposed to care about them. And the government hospitals
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:06.220]  for the military obviously are some of the worst in the world. The abuse of the military is just
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:15.100]  incredible. And they just expand out from there on a daily basis the way our troops are treated.
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:20.220]  And I do make a big deal about the record suicides. I saw a statistic, there's seven times
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:25.500]  the highest number per capita ever before seen. And that was at the end of the Vietnam War,
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:30.460]  seven times. I mean, it is epidemic, but they wanna just keep that out of the news
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:36.300]  and just expand the wars. And the troops don't wanna be patted on the back and told how great
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.140]  they are. They don't wanna be in evil wars. They don't wanna be sick from DU and nobody
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:45.260]  gives them treatment so they kill themselves. They don't wanna be put on government lists
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:50.060]  because they're veterans. They don't want the uppies to come out of the country and
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:54.300]  to come up and thank them all day. Because that's the cutesy thing to do.
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:12:00.780]  They want their country back. They want Ron Paul to be elected. Again, 70 plus percent,
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:08.300]  what is it, 74% of all the donations for Democrats and President Obama and then all the Republicans
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:14.860]  is to Ron Paul. The vast majority of donations are to Ron Paul and the system knows that.
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:19.900]  And so that's why they're so scared. I mean, the truth is the average Americans got their
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:24.860]  head screwed on actually pretty straight. Especially if they live in the real world
[02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:32.860]  and aren't on welfare or something, or just a total TV head. It's just a tiny group of crooks
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:36.700]  that are up at the top that are running this entire system. I appreciate your call.
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:40.140]  Let's go ahead and go to Chad in New York. Chad, you're on the air.
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:45.740]  Hello, Mr. Jones. How are you doing today, sir? I'm doing wonderful, my friend. Another day above
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:53.020]  ground is a good day. Yes, sir. I just want to thank you for leading our people in this time
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:59.260]  of darkness, okay? And what I mean by that, sir, is that the education that you are dropping
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:07.340]  on America is needed. And I think that we as Americans need to wake up and take our country
[02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:17.420]  back. It's been far too long that we've had crooks and crooked individuals running our country
[02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:24.540]  and dictating what policies that they want achieved. And I think that it's people like you
[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:28.940]  that's going to lead us out of the darkness of the country. And I just want to say, Mr. Jones,
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:33.100]  I haven't been awake that long. I've only been awake for about six months,
[02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:39.100]  but I'm a cabbie in Long Island, New York, and I've been spreading the word through my cab
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:46.300]  about your organization and about other organizations and about the truth that needs to be told.
[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:54.540]  We need a new investigation of 9-11. We need these crooks brought to justice, Mr. Jones,
[02:13:55.260 --> 02:14:01.100]  by any means necessary. And I am a veteran too, 82nd Airborne, four years I was in the Army,
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:09.900]  okay? And I want to tell you, sir, I took an oath to defend the Constitution from enemies,
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:14.780]  foreign and domestic, sir. And if it comes to a revolution in this country, you better believe
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:23.100]  that I will defend the Constitution. That is not an oath taken lightly. And any veteran out there
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:31.100]  or any military person that is out there needs to understand what that oath means, okay? There are
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:38.380]  traitorous people in this country dragging us down to the abyss, Mr. Jones. And I just wanted to say
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:43.340]  that. I'm sorry you're a busy man, and I do apologize for taking up your time. But sir,
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:48.380]  you are a true patriot, and I just want you to know your work is not unappreciated.
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:54.220]  It is very appreciated, sir. And I- Well, Chad, God bless you. Please don't apologize for calling
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:58.140]  in and being passionate and taking time. That's why we're here and taking your calls, but I do
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:04.700]  appreciate you calling. Look, it hurts though every time somebody tells me what a great job
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:13.260]  I'm doing. I don't know how to explain it. When I was at that barbecue place Saturday night
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:22.220]  here in Austin, every person behind the counter was a listener. Every person told me they
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:28.300]  appreciated me. And I watched him giving my kids bigger servings than other people were getting.
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:32.460]  And I watched people looking at me when I was sitting down and eating. I'd go to the bathroom.
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:36.300]  People would say, hey, we appreciate what you're doing. I got up to walk or get some ice tea.
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:43.260]  And I just looked at young men, old women, black, white, Hispanic, you name it, looking at me
[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:56.700]  and admiring me and holding me up. And it's like, wow, I've got such an incredible responsibility.
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:02.540]  And I guess it's because I do fight corruption for the right reasons.
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:08.700]  I do fight corruption for the right reasons. I mean, I do it because I don't wanna be a slave.
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:13.340]  It's real simple. And I don't want you to be a slave, but I still
[02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:21.340]  to see so many people counting on me,
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:28.940]  then it almost makes me overthink every step I make and try to do too good a job.
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:35.580]  I don't know how to explain it. It's very exhausting. It's very, very exhausting.
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:44.940]  I was in a restaurant a few months ago and there was a waiter. We were at a steakhouse,
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:49.420]  had some friends in town. And the waiter comes over and says, I've bought you
[02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:54.140]  these drinks and the appetizer. I just wanna thank you.
[02:16:54.140 --> 02:17:01.340]  And he was like an immigrant from, I think he said, Brazil. And he said, I've lived under
[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:05.260]  corruption. I know what you're saying. It was true. I see it happening here. And he had broken
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:13.180]  English. But he said, I just admire your courage in the face of this evil, how you stomp and smash
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:21.100]  on everything in your way. And the guy was looking at me with just awe. And I mean, I stomp and smash
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:28.700]  on everything because I don't have time to be afraid, folks. I don't have time to sit here and
[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:36.540]  worry about what I say and what I do. I mean, it is a passion of work to try to get the news out,
[02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:41.420]  to try to not make mistakes, to try to have the same passion in my crew.
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:48.620]  To try to cover every angle and every facet and to know that there's always 100 times more news
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:56.220]  that I can't even get to or properly talk about. Because the mind moves hundreds of times faster
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:18:06.540]  than the voice. I don't know how to explain it anymore. But I hear all these great people
[02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:11.340]  counting on us. And look, I count on you. I couldn't do what I do without you.
[02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:19.260]  And we're all in this together. And again, it feels good to have people look up to me.
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:26.380]  It's just that 50% of it feels good, but the other 50 is the responsibility.
[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:30.620]  When you see all these people counting on you,
[02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:37.820]  and I realized that a lot of them think that I or my audience that we're somehow gonna turn
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:41.420]  this around. And I got news for you folks, it's gonna be you that turns it around.
[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:47.580]  And to see the economy hurting, to see so many businesses here in Austin,
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:50.940]  which is doing better than most areas of the country, shut down. And to see people
[02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:57.260]  not having enough money to take care of their families. And to see prosperity being sucked
[02:18:57.260 --> 02:19:06.540]  out of this nation. It could all just be turned around if we didn't have these vicious criminals
[02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:11.740]  running our society, who openly admit that they're at war with prosperity.
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:16.060]  They don't want you prosperous. They want you super poor, so you're totally dependent on them.
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:22.060]  It's feudalism. That's how they, in ancient Europe, had control of people.
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:29.740]  And it is a revolution against free society. The globalist are the revolutionaries.
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:35.740]  They're the people waging war against society.
[02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:47.740]  And as the New World Order unfolds, it does get heavier and heavier.
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:56.700]  It gets more and more out in the open. And it cuts right to my soul, just how real this is.
[02:19:56.700 --> 02:20:00.140]  I wish it wasn't. I'll be back. Stay with us.

[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.340]  That's 877-288-9116.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:00.160]  BioAge, the age of advanced organics.
[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:05.660]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar
[02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:07.160]  kicks in the door of a dark house
[02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:09.100]  that looks like no one is home.
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:10.940]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:13.220]  Make it look like someone is home watching television
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:14.460]  with fake TV.
[02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:16.620]  Fake TV is a small electronic device
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:18.920]  that makes the same light as a real television.
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:21.900]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:24.380]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:26.400]  but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:29.700]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm
[02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:32.420]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:23:32.420 --> 02:23:34.300]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:37.020]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95,
[02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:42.180]  go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.780]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:46.900]  So get one for you and one for a loved one
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:49.900]  for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:55.620]  Call 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:57.340]  faketv.com.
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:23:58.380]  The burglar deterrent.
[02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:18.460]  OK, I want to get into some of the other news here and then more of your calls and Bev Harris.
[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:24.140]  But every time I see articles like this one,
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:34.300]  it just reminds me that government and big institutions can't and won't protect you.
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:40.620]  And the idea that government will deliver you your food and your job and your vacation
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:42.700]  and will make decisions for you.
[02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:48.100]  And the idea that that's going to work is a proven historical fraud.
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:53.380]  And now that they've added technological overlays to it,
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:54.380]  it's only made it worse.
[02:24:54.380 --> 02:24:58.540]  I mean, I saw an article where thousands of people a year of the LA Times reported are
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:05.060]  charged just in mistakes because the government doesn't have their name right.
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:09.780]  And how in California, the police are exempt and government workers from having their license
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:15.260]  plates read by license plate reading cameras, side issue.
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:19.060]  But I see this article on the Daily Mail, there's one of the Reuters about chain of
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:27.680]  arrows caused disaster and in cruise ship sinking.
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:37.340]  But here's one out of the Daily Mail, I saw captain drinking in the bar.
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:48.260]  Passengers accused arrest officer of socializing before a cruise crash and being among first
[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:52.700]  to abandon ship.
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:26:03.180]  And I know that, I mean, does it even matter anymore?
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:07.180]  It doesn't matter if it's Katrina, it doesn't matter if it's a forest fire, it doesn't matter
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:08.640]  what it is.
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:12.660]  The government just generally gets in the way and screws everything up.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:18.900]  And then even in a private cruise ship, every time they have one of these big disasters,
[02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:31.280]  the captain is drunk as a skunk.
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:41.060]  And then puts out some big story about how the charts were wrong.
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:49.540]  I mean, he ran the boat up on the beach, he ran it right into the island.
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:54.540]  Now if a captain can screw up like this with 4,000 people on board, and if governments
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:59.420]  can't help you during Katrina, but they can sure come take your guns in a beta test.
[02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:05.220]  How's the government gonna protect you if a airborne Ebola or smallpox or something
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:09.100]  like that gets put out in the atmosphere?
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:14.820]  I mean, let's say the government doesn't release it on purpose because they wanna reduce population.
[02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:18.620]  How long until they have a mistake and release it?
[02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:25.180]  The government admits that they released weaponized Lyme's disease out of the Plum Island facility
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:27.340]  off the coast of New York.
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:34.380]  And it first showed up in Lyme, Connecticut, hence the name Lyme's disease.
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:39.820]  I mean, how many times, and they've got hundreds of these labs all over the country with airborne
[02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:44.300]  weaponized stuff that will kill nine out of ten or more.
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:50.940]  I'm just rounding down between 92 and 99% of those that come in contact with these different
[02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:52.440]  things.
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:57.320]  And they've got facilities all over the country with this.
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:03.420]  And it's only a matter of time until a crazy person sneaks out of the lab with it and releases
[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:09.380]  it, or somebody makes a mistake, or the government releases it and claims somebody made a mistake
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:14.820]  or that a crazy person did it, and they put the patsy on television.
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:20.680]  And what do you think's gonna happen when an airborne bio weapon gets out?
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:27.660]  And by the way, it'll be just like the foot and mouth in 2000 in England that showed up
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:32.420]  in locations from Southern Scotland all the way down to Cornwall.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:36.860]  And all the way down to the southern coast of England in a two day period, it shows up
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:37.860]  all over the country.
[02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:40.260]  It had been distributed on purpose.
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:46.300]  I saw that map day one and said it's government, it's weaponized, it's killing.
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:50.460]  I went and looked up foot and mouth and sheep and cows and it kills a very small percentage,
[02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:51.460]  less than 10%.
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:56.900]  And I was like, this is killing more than half of them, it's weaponized.
[02:28:56.900 --> 02:29:02.020]  Not because I'm a rocket scientist, but I know how to look into stuff.
[02:29:02.020 --> 02:29:07.380]  And then about a year later, in the BBC and the London Guardian, there was a little footnote
[02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:16.480]  of, there was a level four bioweapons lab testing zoological weaponized animal diseases.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:22.580]  And they believe that some type of extremist working at the lab got it out and released
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:23.580]  it.
[02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:26.920]  Well, that would have happened in one or two spots, not all over the country.
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:32.940]  In one day, showing up everywhere, swabbed onto the animals.
[02:29:32.940 --> 02:29:38.940]  So don't think you're gonna go hide out in the country when the new flu gets out.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:43.620]  It's gonna be getting sprayed from drones, folks, it isn't gonna be person to person.
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:50.940]  They're gonna spray the entire country with this stuff, man, we're in so much trouble.
[02:29:50.940 --> 02:30:03.020]  Here on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:06.780]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:09.620]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:14.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:15.260]  at home.
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:20.300]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:21.300]  the shots.
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:26.060]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:31.740]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:36.420]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:38.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:39.840]  They're asking for more matches.
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:42.940]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:44.700]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:50.060]  And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:50.060 --> 02:30:56.700]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now
[02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:59.500]  in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:02.660]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:06.620]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.240]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:12.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:13.280]  or gold?
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:16.640]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.820]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:23.020]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:24.020]  seeds.
[02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:29.060]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:31.180]  dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:32.300]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:36.500]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:38.980]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:42.260]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:42.260 --> 02:31:49.020]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:49.020 --> 02:31:51.020]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:58.020]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:01.100]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:01.100 --> 02:32:05.180]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century?
[02:32:05.180 --> 02:32:09.480]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:13.460]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off, and placing your child's
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:18.860]  name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:22.820]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:28.300]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:30.780]  dependency, your food supply.

[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:44.660]  Okay, we're back live.
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:34:00.380]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:06.540]  We have undoubtedly the preeminent researcher into election fraud in the last few decades.
[02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:11.660]  And of course, the HBO documentary Black Box Voting was seen by tens of millions.
[02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:16.580]  And we've seen just in the last five, six years, national numbers go from less than
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:22.740]  10% believing there's election fraud to over 70% in some polls, 90% in some of the others.
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:28.140]  And a lot of that's thanks to Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting.org.
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:33.900]  I saw an article yesterday that we also posted at Infowars.com from Black Box Voting.
[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:41.860]  Recipe for vote fraud, global Internet voting firm buys US election results reporting firm.
[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:49.260]  Now remember, Bev, two days before the Iowa caucuses, she said, listen, the fact that
[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:56.420]  they're counting into the secret location, if any of the precincts don't report or don't
[02:34:56.420 --> 02:35:00.820]  call it in properly or don't show people the results, that's where you'll find fraud.
[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:05.900]  And now we have the clip we played a few weeks ago of Karl Rove on Fox News as their correspondent
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:09.260]  saying, yes, well, some of the precincts didn't come in.
[02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:13.660]  So we had a gentleman's agreement and gave Santorum six more points so he got second
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:15.180]  place instead of Paul.
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:20.000]  I mean, they just hide this stuff in plain view.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.100]  And then of course, Ron Paul was happy with his second place there in New Hampshire.
[02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:29.180]  But even local Iowa newspapers reported on all the weirdness that went on.
[02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:32.900]  So it's all about that funnel she talks about.
[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:34.860]  When stuff's in public, it's out in the open.
[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:41.800]  But it's that little bitty thin area, that Strait of Hormuz, where the problems can happen.
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.220]  And that's where the lights go off like in the mystery movie.
[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:50.060]  When they come back on, well, the Maltese Falcon has been stolen or whatever the case
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:55.320]  is, or grandma's secret recipe has been stolen.
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:00.900]  And so this report breaks it down and she joins us now to also give us any other developments
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:02.380]  that she's looking at.
[02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:03.860]  Beth, thanks for coming on.
[02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:04.860]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:10.600]  Well, yeah, and if I could, I'd like to just make a quick comment on that Iowa situation
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:14.460]  before we move on to the global situation.
[02:36:14.460 --> 02:36:21.220]  You know, Iowa was very interesting because it looks like Santorum either won or well,
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:23.900]  anyway, Romney didn't win.
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:30.460]  And there were some incidents, but there's a big difference between setting it up properly,
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:35.980]  which they really did in Iowa, so that people can see when stuff is wrong.
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:41.780]  It was an alert citizen by the name of Edward True, who was attending, who was able to see
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:46.340]  when they announced the vote that it did not match what got called into the Republican
[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:47.340]  Party.
[02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:52.860]  And in fact, Romney only had two votes and they called in 22 votes.
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:57.980]  And as we, as those who've been following us may know, there was only eight votes reported
[02:36:57.980 --> 02:36:58.980]  to have separated them.
[02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:00.980]  So in fact, Romney didn't win.
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:05.060]  And all this we're seeing on the media, Romney won and it's historic and blah, blah, blah.
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:06.060]  He didn't win.
[02:37:06.060 --> 02:37:11.140]  But the reason we know he didn't win was because it was done in public.
[02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:17.140]  There was another very interesting clip I saw, actually, I think you may have broken
[02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:22.980]  this story, in Scott County, where as they were turning in the ballots, the lights went
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:25.460]  off for like 15 or 20 seconds.
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:30.740]  Well, here's the thing, when you set it up properly, and I do think that Iowa is really
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:37.100]  how we need to be setting a lot of this stuff up, the fact that we know, the fact they had
[02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:41.380]  to turn the lights off in the first place was because the public was there able to watch.
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:46.340]  The fact that we know the lights got turned off was because the public was there able
[02:37:46.340 --> 02:37:47.340]  to watch.
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:55.420]  So we have to kind of separate catching people in fraud when it's set up so that we can catch
[02:37:55.420 --> 02:37:57.700]  them in fraud, which is what we at least want.
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:03.220]  We at least wanna be able to catch them versus the more dangerous situations where we can't
[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:05.940]  even catch them because it's concealed.
[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:12.820]  Now, I wanna talk briefly just about how voter news services worked previously, how nationally
[02:38:12.820 --> 02:38:17.860]  you could have Karl Rove in 2000 announce the opposite of what the other networks announced.
[02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:22.340]  And it turned out the other networks were accurate, and then Karl Rove was just appointing
[02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:23.340]  himself king.
[02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:26.780]  And again, I'm not an Al Gore supporter, folks, but facts are facts here.
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:31.320]  But I wanna play this clip from Iowa since you mentioned it before we get into this big
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:33.900]  breaking news that you've got for us here, Bev.
[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:36.220]  I wanna play this little clip.
[02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:41.860]  This is from Fox News, but we've added the little Kentucky Derby clip where he says,
[02:38:41.860 --> 02:38:45.700]  and out of nowhere, Santorum comes into the lead.
[02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:51.420]  But other than that, this is Karl Rove on Fox News, here it is.
[02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:57.260]  Romney is gonna win the Iowa caucuses by 14 votes, how solid is your evidence?
[02:38:57.260 --> 02:38:58.860]  From a pretty good reliable source.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:02.940]  They made the correction in Story County, which moved it from an 18-point margin for
[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:06.980]  Santorum to a four-vote margin for Santorum.
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:13.260]  Clinton, you have the one outstanding precinct in the state, and that it will show an 18-vote
[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:19.640]  victory in that precinct for Mitt Romney, which will give him a statewide victory of
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:20.640]  14 votes over-
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:23.140]  And from out of nowhere, it's Rick Santorum.
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:26.340]  I don't understand, you're saying that they basically have come to an agreement as to
[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:29.580]  what the vote's gonna be in Clinton?
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:34.780]  The person who's got the official piece of paper is missing, but the Romney and Santorum
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:38.060]  people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is.
[02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:42.180]  They've barely rounded up the representatives of the camps who've agreed, yes, we were there,
[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:47.140]  we know exactly what the vote total was, and we both agree to what it was.
[02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:48.620]  So Bev, what do you make of that?
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:50.620]  They agree, then, who the winner is now.
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:55.940]  Well, that was pretty bogus, but I do know about that situation, and that particular
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:40:00.380]  situation actually turned out to be acceptably transparent.
[02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:05.740]  What had happened is, the result was called in, and the woman went home and was ready
[02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:09.300]  to go to bed, and they said they didn't have the results or whatever.
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:15.620]  But at any rate, the result that finally made its way in was verified by people who were
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:18.020]  there and people who were watching and so forth.
[02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:21.700]  The key here is you gotta be able to see what's going on.
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:23.700]  Exactly, and anybody that-
[02:40:23.700 --> 02:40:28.740]  Yeah, if you can see it, then when they do monkey business like this, somebody steps
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:33.820]  forward, and the great part is they never know who has their cell phone out taking a
[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:35.780]  picture of what's going on.
[02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:42.500]  So it's very likely, when people are organized like they were with Ron Paul in Iowa, that
[02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:43.500]  it's gonna get caught.
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:48.700]  Well, Bev, I mean, just as a layman here who's been watching this for 17 years and having
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:54.180]  experts like yourself on this key subject, the idea that we're just supposed to trust
[02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:58.420]  these electronic voting machine companies who've been caught cheating, manipulating,
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:41:01.620]  being hacked, backdoors being built in.
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:07.060]  And then when you do have transparent systems, there's always normal problems and chicanery
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:08.060]  there.
[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:12.900]  So the claim that we shouldn't have transparent elections and that we're just being paranoid,
[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:14.380]  well, that's ridiculous.
[02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:20.540]  Right, and if you notice how the news media spins this, and both the right wing and the
[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:27.260]  left wing canned news outlets, just editorial outlets basically, spun it the same way.
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:33.180]  Then it was founded by a citizen that the vote count that was reported was wrong.
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:38.460]  They started ridiculing the system and saying how ridiculous it was, and they don't know
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:42.300]  what they're doing because people were able to see what's going on.
[02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:48.020]  So they neatly turned that corner from, people can see what's going on, so problems see the
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:53.260]  light of day, to, oh, they don't know what they're going on because, look, there were
[02:41:53.260 --> 02:41:54.260]  problems.
[02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:56.180]  You're gonna find problems if you can see them.
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:42:02.540]  If the system is set up right, so, you know, what we're looking at in the upcoming election
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:07.500]  in South Carolina and most other elections is something where the citizens can't see
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:08.500]  anything.
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:14.300]  So yeah, it's gonna be pretty smooth and they can come in and they can report their results,
[02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:18.420]  you know, too sweet in eight seconds like they like to do, and then they'll say, and
[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.140]  there were no problems and it went smoothly.
[02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:24.020]  Well, yeah, that's because the public wasn't allowed to watch.
[02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:32.500]  Break it down, in simple terms, your article, Recipe for Vote Fraud, a global internet
[02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:38.060]  voting firm buys US election results reporting firm, I mean, isn't that a national security
[02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:41.300]  issue to have foreign companies controlling our voting?
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:45.860]  I mean, are we gonna have foreign countries or companies controlling our nuclear weapons
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:46.860]  development, Bev?
[02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:47.860]  What's next?
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:54.660]  I didn't actually title it Recipe for Vote Fraud, although, and I think, let me just
[02:42:54.660 --> 02:43:00.060]  mention about, you know, the frame of vote fraud versus the frame I prefer to see.
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:06.380]  You see, vote fraud may happen with an open system that we can see, but then we can see
[02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:11.300]  it, or it may happen with a concealed system we can't see that's controlled by a corporation.
[02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:16.540]  But what we have to have is a structure so that we can see what's going on, because if
[02:43:16.540 --> 02:43:22.220]  we can see it, that will ultimately help prevent vote fraud or catch it or expose it.
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:30.820]  So what's going on now, it's unbelievably dangerous to the whole democratic structure.
[02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:33.860]  In fact, it removes the democratic structure.
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:41.260]  What we have is, already, we have one company which is in charge of results reporting for,
[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:46.540]  I wrote in my article, over 525 United States jurisdictions this fall.
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:53.540]  It's actually gonna be over 900 jurisdictions in 26 states, instead of, you'll go to your
[02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:57.980]  county website and you'll look at that and it'll say, oh, here's the results.
[02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:00.260]  Well, not really.
[02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:04.700]  In over 900 counties, when you go to your county website, you're actually looking at
[02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:08.420]  a redirected site out of Tampa, Florida.
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:16.300]  And so all the results for 26 states and 900 locations are actually going to Tampa, Florida
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:18.500]  before they're reported.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:22.060]  And then we add to that.
[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:28.300]  That firm that reports the results is then purchased by another firm out of Spain.
[02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:32.900]  And that firm out of Spain also produces the voting system.
[02:44:32.900 --> 02:44:38.580]  Now there you get, and by the way, the type of voting that that firm is, which is called
[02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:43.260]  CIDL, S-C-Y-T-L, the type of voting that it's promoting is the worst kind of voting.
[02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:44.260]  It's internet voting.
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:51.100]  And the reason it's the worst is because the public can't see who cast the votes into that
[02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:52.100]  internet system.
[02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:54.780]  They can't see the counting of the vote.
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:58.700]  The chain of custody is completely evaporated.
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:04.380]  So you're saying, it's like, trust me, this internet voting counted by some place in Spain
[02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:05.380]  is right.
[02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:12.140]  And the same company is going to report the results to the United States.
[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:16.460]  And by the way, this was first reported five days ago by Market Watch, which is part of
[02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:20.260]  the Wall Street Journal, and it says it right there.
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:23.660]  And then I'm looking, because I guess this is the headline we got from another site with
[02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:24.660]  your article.
[02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:29.580]  At blackboxvoting.org, what's the actual headline of the original article you wrote, Bev?
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:35.100]  It just, kind of turned it down, Global Internet Voting Firm Buys U.S. Election Results Reporting
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:36.100]  Firm.
[02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:42.140]  And then I basically lead sentences in a major step toward global centralization of election
[02:45:42.140 --> 02:45:44.580]  processes, because that's really what it's doing.
[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:51.580]  I think it will help if we focus on structure, because they can't steal elections as easily
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:53.980]  if the right structure is in place.
[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:59.460]  If we put the wrong structure in place, they can do it whatever they want and we'll never
[02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:01.900]  know, and the whole thing becomes theater.
[02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:08.180]  Well, sure, and I mean, the issue here is that we need to be able to track this thing
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:09.860]  from start to finish.
[02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:12.980]  But Bev, you should probably briefly recap.
[02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:16.780]  Give us some of the greatest hits of election fraud and scams.
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:20.460]  People forget that executives have gone public and said it's fraud.
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:23.140]  Engineers have gone public, they've been caught.
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:25.860]  I mean, give us some of the greatest hits.
[02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:30.380]  Oh, you know, there's one that's going on right now in South Carolina.
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:36.260]  I mean, it happens locally, it happens all over the place, but this is new, you haven't
[02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:37.260]  heard this yet before.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:45.500]  And this place, they have, there were so many things that went wrong, but basically they
[02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:51.540]  were using these electronic voting machines and the results were so suspicious that they
[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:58.500]  sequestered the machines at the local police's office, it was a city election, and they were
[02:46:58.500 --> 02:47:03.380]  going to examine the machines, they set the election aside, it was so bad, and they were
[02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:04.380]  going to examine the machines.
[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:10.460]  Well, just before they go to examine the machines, in flukes the county, the county sheriff,
[02:47:10.460 --> 02:47:16.580]  now, understand, you've got the local police officer, home rule, the chief of police, you've
[02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:18.300]  got the county sheriff.
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:24.940]  The county sheriff sweeps in, with a bolt cutter, to take the machines out of the local
[02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:28.620]  police chief's evidence room.
[02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:33.660]  And so, they wouldn't let him do that, so they go to court and the judge says, oh, okay,
[02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:34.660]  you can go get him.
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:42.100]  It was just crazy, why, we see this kind of stuff happening all the time, where the machines
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:50.300]  are sequestered, the, you know, but the bottom line is, you can't prove it, because no
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:55.700]  one can see it, and even, you can't extract the programming, you're just out of luck.
[02:47:55.700 --> 02:48:01.140]  In South Carolina, which is going to be a presidential primary this Saturday, we can't
[02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:03.940]  see anything and we can't prove anything.
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:08.700]  It goes into a computer program controlled by a private company, it wouldn't matter
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:13.660]  if it was public, because if they don't let you see anything, and you have absolutely
[02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:14.660]  no idea.
[02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:19.080]  And Beth, how many times in front of the news have you gone and with engineers hacked into
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:21.140]  these voting systems, sometimes in seconds?
[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:27.340]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, four seconds, me and my assistant actually got into a voting
[02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:32.900]  system in one minute with $12 worth of tools, and you have to understand, me and my assistant
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:37.340]  are both, you know, like a 50-year-old woman, well, I'm 60 now, 50 then.
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:40.940]  We didn't even know anything about electronics, but you know, we figured it out, well, let's
[02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:46.700]  get a screwdriver, let's take this, I wasn't really, basically, someone who is an advanced
[02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:51.680]  TV repairman can tamper with the result in most voting machines.
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:56.620]  And if they'll kick Ron Paul out of debates and say he can't win, and engage in all this
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:02.100]  other behavior, and lie about double EMDs, and pass laws that can secretly arrest citizens
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:06.180]  and have us disappear into black holes, this is about trillions of dollars a year of special
[02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:11.700]  interest control, you'd have to be insane to say they wouldn't use systems like this
[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:15.380]  to engage in fraud, and these companies have been caught over and over again.
[02:49:15.380 --> 02:49:19.140]  Whatever happened with Diebold when they changed their name and sold off their systems?
[02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:24.140]  Well, you know, here's the deal with Diebold, they changed the name, then they sold it,
[02:49:24.140 --> 02:49:25.140]  they sold it to who?
[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:31.340]  The biggest voting machine company in the country, election systems and software, so
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:35.420]  I went to the Department of Justice and hammered on them, and said, you've got to stop this,
[02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:40.580]  this is totally a monopoly, they control now 70% of the vote counting in the United States.
[02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:43.100]  So what does the Justice Department do?
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:50.980]  They wait, and wait, and wait, and then they sell off part of the acquisition to a company
[02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:55.020]  out of Toronto, Canada, which nobody knows who owns.
[02:49:55.020 --> 02:50:01.700]  So at this point, we have 70% of the votes in the US counted by two companies, election
[02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:06.580]  systems and software, and the other one is called Dominion, and we don't know who owns
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:07.980]  either company.
[02:50:07.980 --> 02:50:11.120]  We have no idea.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:17.460]  This would be like going into some machine with a carnival marker and he says, pull the
[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:20.700]  lever and the machine will tell you if you want, and you're like, well, this machine's
[02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:25.220]  rigged, and he says, trust me, I mean, this is the oldest trick in the book.
[02:50:25.220 --> 02:50:27.220]  Oh, it is.
[02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:32.580]  So much of what I see is simply a magic show.
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:36.740]  When you ask a question, your attention is redirected somewhere else, just like someone
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:37.740]  who's watching a magician.
[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:43.820]  It's like, don't look there, look here, but if you keep your eye on the ball, it's just
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:44.820]  indefensible.
[02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:47.340]  Bev Harris, we're coming up to the end of the show, but do one more segment with us
[02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:53.160]  because I want you to finish that point and also give us hotspots that you see in other
[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:57.020]  primaries coming up, because you called exactly what was gonna happen in Iowa and in New
[02:50:57.020 --> 02:50:58.020]  Hampshire.
[02:50:58.020 --> 02:51:01.820]  So other areas that you're investigating right now, we'll be right back.
[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:05.900]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century?
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:11.260]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors thankful for the unemployment
[02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:16.580]  checks since you were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes
[02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:19.540]  of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:51:19.540 --> 02:51:23.540]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:29.020]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:31.500]  dependency, your food supply.

[02:54:24.060 --> 02:54:26.780]  We've got an article up at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:26.780 --> 02:54:31.220]  CDC increases pressure on parents to vaccinate kids with deadly toxins.
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:35.820]  We've got newscasts out of California, where they come to the door and say, we're here
[02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:39.740]  to shoot your child up, just outside of law.
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:51.600]  And we're getting reports here that we're gonna try to confirm out of Pennsylvania.
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:56.980]  And this is actually from the sports director at a YMCA, I'll just leave it at that, where
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:00.980]  they call the state police on them when they wouldn't take a vaccine.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:04.540]  Wow, this is crazy, I've gotta get these people on.
[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:08.900]  You know, Bev, it's wild how nuts everything's getting.
[02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:11.540]  Well, yeah, it is.
[02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:16.780]  People sometimes, I think one of the people that read my recent article said, is that
[02:55:16.780 --> 02:55:17.780]  it?
[02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:18.780]  Is it all over?
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:21.140]  Should we just put up our feet and eat bon-bon?
[02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:27.100]  But you have to look at this for the scale that it is.
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:34.620]  And I think once you do that, then you can start to at least approach things in a, with
[02:55:34.620 --> 02:55:37.060]  a realistic frame.
[02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:41.060]  It's not going to be something, we can wave a magic wand, and all this stuff is gonna
[02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:43.380]  get corrected quickly.
[02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:49.220]  We have to first understand what the key part of the problem is, and then go after it.
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:51.860]  We just gotta keep going after it.
[02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:55.940]  I actually want to give some, I want to mention something there.
[02:55:55.940 --> 02:56:03.140]  Back in the 1700s, before the U.S. was even a country, you know, they banned slavery for
[02:56:03.140 --> 02:56:04.140]  the first time in the world.
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:08.900]  Up until that point, 75% of all people on the face of the earth were either slaves or
[02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:09.900]  indentured servants.
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:13.060]  The entire economy was based on it.
[02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:16.040]  It was banned by a small group of citizens.
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.380]  It took them 75 years, but they got it banned.
[02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:25.900]  So, and I point to that, to point to the idea that you can actually have success.
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:26.900]  It's been done before.
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:31.540]  Oh, well, look at the SOPA, I mean, they're now shelving the SOPA bill.
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:33.780]  So when we take action, we can have an effect.
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:36.980]  Looking at Florida, you were making some great points during the break about what you expect
[02:56:36.980 --> 02:56:39.900]  to see in South Carolina and Florida.
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:45.500]  Well, South Carolina is, I don't know, it's completely concealed.
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:46.500]  We have no idea.
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:51.180]  They've had some extremely bizarre results before out of South Carolina.
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:57.060]  There was a, if you have any questions about that, Google Alvin Green in 2010, a completely
[02:56:57.060 --> 02:56:58.580]  bizarre situation.
[02:56:58.580 --> 02:57:00.540]  So we don't know.
[02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:05.340]  South Carolina is going to be whatever the powers that be make it be.
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:14.740]  Florida is really, I think, where it's going to start to ramp up, because Florida is, they're
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:18.540]  saying now there's twice as many absentee ballots as normal.
[02:57:18.540 --> 02:57:23.100]  Absentee has all the problems of electronic voting, plus all the problems of vote stuffing
[02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:24.740]  and not knowing who voted.
[02:57:24.740 --> 02:57:26.420]  So you've got that.
[02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:31.780]  And then you've got, in Florida, you now have paper ballots, but guess what they did?
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:36.780]  They made it against the law to look at the paper ballots, even in a recount.
[02:57:36.780 --> 02:57:37.780]  Wow.
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:41.100]  I mean, you know, so there we go.
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:45.580]  We know the history of Florida in terms of all kinds of election fraud and election problems.
[02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:50.460]  But I think what we're going to start seeing, and this has been the whole push all along,
[02:57:50.460 --> 02:57:53.260]  is going to be let's get these candidates out of the field.
[02:57:53.260 --> 02:57:54.700]  Let's get them to step aside.
[02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:56.420]  Let's anoint our winner.
[02:57:56.420 --> 02:58:02.420]  And you can really tell how it's going to go by watching the selected pundits on the
[02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:08.300]  major network news, well, you know, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, you go get them all and watch what
[02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:09.300]  they do.
[02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:13.020]  And they're drum beaten and their drum beat that I've been I've been noticing right now
[02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:20.580]  is, well, Ron Paul is going to be able to have some effect because he's got delegates.
[02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:25.620]  In other words, in code, step aside, you're in the way, but we'll let you have some effect
[02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:26.620]  on the platform.
[02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:28.660]  Yeah, that's what they're doing.
[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:30.700]  They're saying Ron Paul can't win, can't win.
[02:58:30.700 --> 02:58:31.700]  Step aside.
[02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:36.780]  And once the other candidates should step aside, blackboxvoting.org, Bev Harris, thank
[02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:38.660]  you so much for spending time with us.
[02:58:38.660 --> 02:58:40.380]  Well, thank you for having me.
[02:58:40.380 --> 02:59:10.340]  Amazing.
