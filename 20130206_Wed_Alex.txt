[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.920 --> 00:34.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34.400 --> 00:43.520]  I have absolutely got to cover all this news. I sat here in the last hour, and of course
[00:43.520 --> 00:48.960]  last night and this morning, reading over all of this news, and I want to cover it all
[00:48.960 --> 00:56.040]  today. I was on Coast to Coast AM last night with George Norie, and after I was on with
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.880]  him, I tuned in and kept listening for about an hour, and just listening to him and others
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.120]  marvel, marvel. And I got a lot of phone calls last night from other talk show hosts and
[01:06.120 --> 01:10.760]  people just saying, I can't believe it's all coming true.
[01:10.760 --> 01:15.040]  You said they would have armed drones in our skies, and that they would say that the government
[01:15.040 --> 01:19.400]  is judge, jury, and executioner, and will preemptively kill you, even if you're not
[01:19.400 --> 01:27.060]  planning an imminent attack. Because if somebody's coming with a machine gun or a bomb, and they've
[01:27.060 --> 01:31.600]  told a witness, I'm gonna go blow something up. The police can set up a checkpoint looking
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.800]  for that vehicle, say stop the vehicle, and if the person that matches the description
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.200]  doesn't stop, then you can kill them.
[01:40.200 --> 01:45.080]  Because you've got probable cause, you've got witnesses, you know what they're planning.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.880]  That's not judge, jury, and executioner, that's self-defense. They take that argument and
[01:49.880 --> 01:55.760]  say, we can just kill whoever we want without the evidence anything's being planned. If
[01:55.760 --> 02:01.080]  the people are connected to a group, connected to a group.
[02:01.080 --> 02:06.800]  And so many times yesterday I got on air, I spent five minutes in three hours yesterday
[02:06.800 --> 02:12.200]  covering the drone story. And everybody else covered it all day long, and I guess that's
[02:12.200 --> 02:18.100]  good, it's just it's such old news for us. People are finally freaking out hearing governors
[02:18.100 --> 02:23.980]  and mayors, not just Jesse Jackson, and members of Congress going, we need armed troops, regular
[02:23.980 --> 02:30.500]  army in the streets of St. Louis, and Chicago, and New York.
[02:30.500 --> 02:36.740]  And we TSA on the streets of every city armed with nine millimeters or 40 cals strapped
[02:36.740 --> 02:41.880]  to their hips, commando style. And yeah, we do need the army on the streets and people
[02:41.880 --> 02:47.480]  are going, man, you said all this is coming. Wow, Alex Jones, you weren't lying to us.
[02:47.480 --> 02:56.400]  I don't want credit, okay? I want you to now listen to me and realize that I know the next
[02:56.400 --> 03:03.340]  phase of this program if we let them go there. Total engineered financial collapse, they're
[03:03.340 --> 03:07.200]  gonna start a civil war calling anyone that resists tyranny a terrorist.
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.080]  They're going to stage false flags to blame and frame us. It's the oldest trick in the
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.880]  book. The Nazis did it, the Soviets did it, the czars did it before the Soviets, the
[03:16.880 --> 03:22.840]  Chinese do it. Every authoritarian, the ancient Romans would set a fire routinely and blame
[03:22.840 --> 03:24.480]  a political enemy inside Rome.
[03:24.480 --> 03:27.960]  Everywhere else, they could just kill you. But if you're a Roman citizen, they had to
[03:27.960 --> 03:35.440]  set you up. That's where this is going. Newsflash, when they got over 100 torture camps worldwide,
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.160]  torture camps more than 35 countries, that's now declassified, this has all come out before.
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.960]  Well, leaked, and then they confirm it's real. When they're doing stuff like that, they're
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.800]  not the good guys, okay? And they want to flip the script off of the Muslim extremist,
[03:51.800 --> 03:54.500]  as they call them, onto the American people in general.
[03:54.500 --> 03:57.640]  They're gonna flip the script. Well, I guess they already flipped the script. Kept telling
[03:57.640 --> 04:03.080]  you for 10, 12 years, they're gonna flip the script. Now they're flipping the script. We're
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.000]  in between right now during the flipping of the script. We're in that no man's land right
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.040]  now. Kinda like when you're driving through the, the light turns green, you pull out and
[04:14.040 --> 04:20.000]  you go, I should have looked. Cuz you see that truck or that car going 60 miles an hour
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.360]  and you look and you try to slam on your brakes and they try to slam on their brakes, but
[04:25.360 --> 04:31.880]  and we're just, I mean, now we're fighting to back this off.
[04:31.880 --> 04:35.000]  And that's applying the brakes. We're applying the brakes, trying to get people in government
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.720]  and corporations to apply the brakes. And so the cars are, but you know they're gonna
[04:39.720 --> 04:47.320]  hit. It's flipping right now. Script's flipping right now. And it's, you think things are
[04:47.320 --> 04:54.800]  crazy right now. You ain't seen nothing yet. Incredibly important news blitz and two big
[04:54.800 --> 05:00.200]  guests, no three big guests coming up. Stay with us.

[08:05.880 --> 08:35.840]  on the GCN Radio Network. It is Wednesday, my friends, the sixth day of February 2013
[08:35.840 --> 08:41.840]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[08:41.840 --> 08:49.280]  Paul Watson joins us with an incredibly important science report, special report at the bottom
[08:49.280 --> 08:55.000]  of the hour. Major scientific institutions have come out and they've cross referenced
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.560]  each other's research and it appears that light waves and other matter is in some type
[09:02.560 --> 09:10.800]  of ordered format that appears to be coded, coded and appears to be a simulation. That's
[09:10.800 --> 09:17.560]  why so many top scientists who were atheist got into the 96% of the DNA and we've done
[09:17.560 --> 09:24.000]  reports on this that they thought was junk and found all the coding in there and got
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.320]  religion very, very quickly.
[09:28.320 --> 09:33.200]  Life did not come out of nothingness and then the atheist say, well, it must have been seated
[09:33.200 --> 09:38.520]  here from deep space. Well, where did that life come from? And then where did that life
[09:38.520 --> 09:48.360]  come from? What is the universe? It is the thought of the creator. It is the God thinks
[09:48.360 --> 09:53.960]  and it is created. It is a simulation of the mind of God, but we are creations with free
[09:53.960 --> 10:01.040]  will made in the image of God. And imagine we are genetic expressions, but endowed with
[10:01.040 --> 10:06.960]  a spirit by God who are able to then decipher the coding.
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.760]  We've now gotten to that point where the scientists are saying there is no God and they're deciphering
[10:11.760 --> 10:17.000]  the coding and going, this whole thing's a simulation. This is designed, this is coded.
[10:17.000 --> 10:27.440]  What is this? And I already knew that cuz I've read the Bible. I don't subscribe to
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.980]  what the Aztecs and the Mayan Mesoamerican culture said. They thought you had to sacrifice
[10:31.980 --> 10:36.580]  kids every day or the gods would wake up and the dream would stop, but they said the universe
[10:36.580 --> 10:43.040]  creation is the God's dream.
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.640]  And so did every other culture. Had basically the same view, but different permutations
[10:48.640 --> 10:57.000]  of it and it's so powerful. Now a lot of mainline Christian denominations and others get shaken
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.920]  by this because it doesn't fit into the little staid preacher on the government payroll up
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.180]  there giving them a limited view of the universe and distorting what's in the Bible and distorting
[11:05.180 --> 11:08.360]  what's in other ancient texts.
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.240]  But we know what's going on. Paul Watts is joining us just from a scientific perspective
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.340]  and we'll show those articles. It's Is the Universe a Computer Simulation? That's his
[11:18.340 --> 11:24.720]  video special report right now at Infowars.com. He'll be joining us live. And then under his
[11:24.720 --> 11:28.780]  special video report, he goes over all the big scientific reports showing this.
[11:28.780 --> 11:34.160]  And this is not the first. And it's in Wired, it's in the New Scientist, it's in Technology
[11:34.160 --> 11:43.920]  Review. It is all right there. Plato's Allegory of the Cave. What we are perceiving, we gotta
[11:43.920 --> 11:50.840]  get David Icahn about this. What we are perceiving is only a limited spectrum visual decoding
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.920]  and encoding of one spectrum of visible light, which is one, depending on the equation you
[11:56.920 --> 12:08.160]  look at, basically incalculable Googleplex of matter.
[12:08.160 --> 12:14.720]  And then matter itself is only one three-dimensional system and our thought goes into the fourth
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.560]  and fifth dimension. And this is what Einstein knew. It's what all the mathematicians find.
[12:19.560 --> 12:26.060]  In fact, there are very few top mathematicians, guys with 170, 180 IQs, who don't grow up
[12:26.060 --> 12:32.460]  atheists from scientific families. And then Einstein said, I believe in God. The universe
[12:32.460 --> 12:36.960]  isn't random. Now there's order to this. God doesn't play dice in creation.
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.800]  Well, let me tell you something. This is designed and it's got level after level after level
[12:43.800 --> 12:50.120]  after level after level to it. Now I'm gonna run through news here. I've gotta do it. I've
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.080]  gotta blitz through news. And then Paul Watson's joining us. Then Jennifer Stahl, she's the
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.480]  mother. They were their child not wanting a smart meter put on her property without
[12:58.480 --> 13:00.160]  a warrant or court order.
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.480]  She was in court trying to block it. That's why they came after her. So she has her legal
[13:04.480 --> 13:09.560]  lawful process and they come after her and they arrested her neighbor that videotaped
[13:09.560 --> 13:14.240]  it. It turns out one other woman and said it's wiretapping to put us on YouTube when
[13:14.240 --> 13:17.160]  the police are in public and there's no perception of privacy.
[13:17.160 --> 13:21.120]  And every court ruling, federal, state, common law, common sense says that that's how they've
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.520]  got cameras watching us in public. And now the cops have a microphone on or a camera
[13:25.520 --> 13:32.000]  on their glasses. I mean, it's just crazy. It's absolutely crazy that I've been all over
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.880]  the country at demonstrations and things I'm covering and the police walk over with the
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.160]  camera mounted to their helmet or to their glasses and they're videotaping and audiotaping.
[13:40.160 --> 13:44.320]  I don't go, call the police. You're going to jail here. Let's put handcuffs on you.
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.360]  They know and it's been thrown out of court thousands of times. There's more than 14 states
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.280]  every week arresting people that I see about the news. So it's must be much more just arresting
[13:54.280 --> 13:56.360]  arresting people for filming them in public.
[13:56.360 --> 14:00.840]  I mean, I've seen them arrest restaurants that have cameras and their own audio and
[14:00.840 --> 14:03.920]  the police come in and do something they don't want seen. They come arrest the restaurant
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.160]  owner. It's your property, your cameras, your microphones for your protection and they come
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.120]  and get you. I mean, I've got a report here now where they're now arresting kids for drawing
[14:15.120 --> 14:19.440]  guns and arresting kids for having a toy squirt gun.
[14:19.440 --> 14:26.040]  And the police are charging them with brandishing a weapon. Now, the code in the state and the
[14:26.040 --> 14:30.800]  federal level says a weapon that has to hurt you and it describes what the weapons are.
[14:30.800 --> 14:36.560]  Projectile weapons, what are those? Firearms, the different types of firearms, bows and
[14:36.560 --> 14:42.680]  arrows, bolt guns, gas guns, not in there.
[14:42.680 --> 14:45.440]  But you see, the family won't know, their lawyer will know and bring them in and get
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.120]  them a plea bargain, get probably $10,000. The 10 year olds gone to jail. Didn't even
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.880]  threaten people. Said, hey, look at my little water gun. Your life's over, bro. You're gonna
[14:56.880 --> 14:57.880]  be in juvenile hall.
[14:57.880 --> 15:03.240]  You're gonna learn how to deal drugs. You're gonna learn how to run stuff for the big banks.
[15:03.240 --> 15:09.120]  You're gonna learn how to act tough and yet but not be tough. And this is the system.
[15:09.120 --> 15:14.080]  This is the Soviet style mind control just pouring in. So she's gonna be joining us.
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.520]  The other's lawyers have told them don't come on so they're all scared. So that I guess
[15:18.520 --> 15:22.040]  they can be marched up where it's been thrown in a court over and over again. They should
[15:22.040 --> 15:25.080]  be filing civil rights violation lawsuits.
[15:25.080 --> 15:31.280]  They're on the sidewalk videotaping police climb over their fence with the utility people
[15:31.280 --> 15:36.840]  to put the smart meter on. And they are even polite to the police. And the police come
[15:36.840 --> 15:44.420]  back two days later when it's on YouTube and arrest them all. And you see the attractive
[15:44.420 --> 15:50.360]  nice neighborhood, attractive nice lady with her child sitting on her hip.
[15:50.360 --> 15:57.000]  This is what police do in Illinois. They come and arrest the state attorney general. Last
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.400]  year wrote a paper and tried to support one town trying to put a guy in jail for life
[16:01.400 --> 16:05.080]  for taping the police in public. We had the guy on, it was in the news. And the news was
[16:05.080 --> 16:07.760]  like maybe he doesn't need life for taping them.
[16:07.760 --> 16:14.840]  Mainstream news was like, yeah, let's have you disappear for life for that. And let's
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.940]  tie that in right now to this stack of news. Document cam please. We have folks watching
[16:19.940 --> 16:26.360]  an Infowarsnews.com. If you're not a prisonplanet.tv subscriber, you should go there. It's $0.59
[16:26.360 --> 16:27.360]  a day.
[16:27.360 --> 16:33.240]  You get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month. No, see that's $0.59 per person per month,
[16:33.240 --> 16:41.320]  not a day, my goodness. Polish dismay over CIA torture memos. It turns out all these
[16:41.320 --> 16:46.980]  dozens of countries were secretly involved in the torture. And secret black sites are
[16:46.980 --> 16:51.560]  ghost sites where they torture innocent people or torture people into false confessions or
[16:51.560 --> 16:53.960]  torture people into going and staging terror attacks.
[16:53.960 --> 16:57.520]  It's been proven and I said this first eight years ago for my sources. Now it's mainline
[16:57.520 --> 17:02.440]  news that these bases are actually torture training bases where they train others how
[17:02.440 --> 17:07.760]  to torture, but they're really mind control basis with CIA psychiatrist at them. And that
[17:07.760 --> 17:13.840]  they're factories that produce the jihad leaders and the new suicide bombers. These are Manchurian
[17:13.840 --> 17:20.520]  candidate factories and almost every new suicide bomber or Al Qaeda leader is a graduate.
[17:20.520 --> 17:26.800]  That's even the media even calls them graduates now of Gitmo. But that's just one of the big,
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.080]  that's like the Harvard of it, where they have the big main president and the CIA torture
[17:31.080 --> 17:37.320]  base within it. And then they have that same model at underground facilities and abandoned
[17:37.320 --> 17:44.840]  horse stables in Romania and Poland and they're doing stuff that is hell razor level.
[17:44.840 --> 17:50.200]  Well it's admitted what they do and it's in the Army's report out of Abu Ghraib. Children,
[17:50.200 --> 17:56.600]  I'm just gonna say that word, children, children. See they just don't wanna go to the Dominican
[17:56.600 --> 18:05.080]  Republic to rape children. They like to do something else to them. All right, let's continue
[18:05.080 --> 18:10.640]  here. That's who runs things. They see you as an animal to be used. This is a psycho
[18:10.640 --> 18:15.600]  guild selling you on torture to fight Al Qaeda, the foreign alien government that's taken
[18:15.600 --> 18:16.600]  over runs.
[18:16.600 --> 18:19.040]  But America's starting to freak out though. People get it. Why are you buying billions
[18:19.040 --> 18:22.280]  of bullets? Why the checkpoints? Why the army on the streets? Why are you torturing the
[18:22.280 --> 18:26.760]  drones? They're for me? I thought it was for Al Qaeda. They're like we run Al Qaeda, you
[18:26.760 --> 18:34.920]  fool. Now the power is ours. Soon we will stage events and blame you. The purge will
[18:34.920 --> 18:39.800]  begin. Well I say go to Hades where you came from. We're awake.
[18:39.800 --> 18:46.880]  Now let's move on here. That's the Financial Times of London. Here's NBC News. NBC News,
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.840]  judge, jury, and executioner. Legal experts fear implication of White House drone memo.
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.120]  This was already the policy. This has been debated in Congress. But now they're saying
[18:57.120 --> 19:02.080]  we'll kill you even if you're not a terrorist if we claim you know a group affiliated with
[19:02.080 --> 19:03.080]  a group.
[19:03.080 --> 19:06.840]  And then all they gotta do is send you an email from one of their operatives, one of
[19:06.840 --> 19:10.460]  their master controllers like Amaral Alaki who they didn't really kill. That was their
[19:10.460 --> 19:15.120]  roll out, their example. We killed this known number two in Al Qaeda who secretly dines
[19:15.120 --> 19:20.960]  at the Pentagon and gets black op command orders. And now General Boykin's going public
[19:20.960 --> 19:24.080]  saying the government's arming Al Qaeda in the Middle East. Yeah, and it's been going
[19:24.080 --> 19:30.960]  on a long time, Boykin. Judge, jury, and executioner, legal experts fear implications of White House
[19:30.960 --> 19:33.160]  drone memo.
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.760]  People are like, wait, it just says no judge, no jury, not even that I'm a terrorist? See,
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.700]  if they can just say you're a terrorist and kill you, why not just say you don't have
[19:41.700 --> 19:45.200]  to be a terrorist, we'll kill you. Because it's already not proof you're a terrorist
[19:45.200 --> 19:49.260]  to say you're a terrorist. I could say you're Jack of the Beanstalk, doesn't mean it is.
[19:49.260 --> 19:54.320]  That's why there's due process. But when we come back, I'm gonna get into all of this
[19:54.320 --> 20:00.080]  and more, the news blitz. Paul Watson, it's all coming up, the nature of reality straight
[20:00.080 --> 20:01.080]  ahead.
[20:01.080 --> 20:05.440]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[20:05.440 --> 20:09.400]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[20:09.400 --> 20:13.640]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[20:13.640 --> 20:17.720]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at E Foods Direct hear from customers every

[20:26.440 --> 20:30.520]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[20:30.520 --> 20:34.620]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day
[20:34.620 --> 20:35.620]  too late.

[22:38.080 --> 22:42.200]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[22:42.200 --> 22:45.560]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing

[24:20.600 --> 24:31.160]  Good old Dave Mustaine of Megadeth bringing us into the transmission. What do you mean?
[24:31.160 --> 24:42.040]  Got nothing better to do. That's the truth. Why do you think I'm broke? If there's a new
[24:42.040 --> 24:51.640]  way, if there's a new way, I'll be the first in line. Monday through Friday, we are here,
[24:51.640 --> 24:55.720]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. Let me just race through news here. So this is just the kind
[24:55.720 --> 24:59.840]  of stuff we have here. Just go over a few of the headlines and not stop and delve too
[24:59.840 --> 25:05.760]  deep. I'll do it later in the broadcast. Polish dismay over CIA torture papers. Judge, I thought
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.880]  Obama said that stopped. Turns out it's radically expanded, but he's liberal, so it's okay.
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.400]  Judge, if you talk bad about Michelle Obama, they say she's gaining weight. That's racist
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.040]  too. I mean, if you're against torture, it's racist. Judge, jury, and executioner, legal
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.280]  experts fear implications of White House drone memo. Exclusive, just department memo reveals
[25:25.280 --> 25:29.480]  legal case for drone strikes on Americans saying that they're above the law and can
[25:29.480 --> 25:32.000]  kill whoever they want with no proof anytime they want.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.720]  And they say, in fact, we don't need the proof. Homeland only fully approves 10% of Freedom
[25:38.720 --> 25:43.000]  of Information Act requests. Yeah, now that Homeland Security's taken over 37 agencies,
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.040]  they just refuse, what, nine out of ten requests, which is violation of federal law, but they
[25:48.040 --> 25:49.040]  don't care.
[25:49.040 --> 25:54.540]  They're gonna spy on you on stuff that's totally protected and legal, but they're gonna break
[25:54.540 --> 25:58.520]  the law and spy on you, but then you're not gonna get the legal stuff on them. How's that
[25:58.520 --> 26:05.160]  sound? How's an army checkpoint for you, scum? You live in Fallujah now. Congress considers
[26:05.160 --> 26:10.160]  putting limits on drone strikes. Yeah, this is their trick. Okay, people are up in arms
[26:10.160 --> 26:12.240]  about us insider trading.
[26:12.240 --> 26:17.680]  We'll just pass a law saying we can, which the media will say bans it. But really, we
[26:17.680 --> 26:21.060]  just have to get a waiver from ourselves. So I mean, I gotta get out of jail free guard
[26:21.060 --> 26:25.840]  from myself, so it's okay. I wonder if you could try that. Go rob a bank, you walk up
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.000]  big bags of money, the cops pull up, get down on the ground, you go, no, I have a note here
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.600]  for myself that says I can rob it.
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.280]  Well, by all means, sir, let me help you in your car. Can I help carry that? But see,
[26:37.280 --> 26:44.120]  it's Congress, they have red carpets and helicopters and jets paid for by us. I mean, the media
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.560]  is asking, is it okay that the senator reportedly was with underage prostitutes?
[26:47.560 --> 26:55.560]  Well, I mean, he's a senator. I mean, he's not a lowly scum taxpayer. Congress considers
[26:55.560 --> 27:01.680]  putting limits on drone strikes, surely. Carney says drone strikes legal, ethical, and wise.
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.880]  Yes, to violate the Geneva Convention, international law, bomb countries that say don't have your
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.960]  drones here killing people, blow up a whole wedding to kill one guy they claims bad while
[27:09.960 --> 27:11.680]  the government runs Al Qaeda publicly.
[27:11.680 --> 27:17.240]  I was out there during the break and it was CNN about mother joined the valiant rebels
[27:17.240 --> 27:24.800]  to fight Assad in Syria after her children were killed. She's a sniper. And CNN's been
[27:24.800 --> 27:30.200]  caught with him going, going to the feed early going, now we do the fake shooting CNN? They're
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.800]  like, yes, do the fake shooting. All right, fire guns now. I am here in battle torn area.
[27:35.800 --> 27:42.200]  They're killing people 500 yards away. Pow, pow, pow, pow. I mean, this is trans and CNN's
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.400]  like, wait, no, don't.
[27:48.400 --> 27:54.560]  When you're around CNN, folks, it is the globalist. It's above CIA. It's the foreign max. I mean,
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.640]  they're there to lie to you. They are enemy soldiers. You're being infiltrated. You're
[28:00.640 --> 28:06.080]  not talking to dumb liberals that mean well and oh, here's Anderson Cooper's boyfriend
[28:06.080 --> 28:07.360]  kissing a guy in the park.
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.240]  All that PR stunt to give them attention. It's like a fake Anderson Cooper sex tape.
[28:12.240 --> 28:17.520]  That's all that is. You perfectly focus photos of him kissing his boyfriend or the boyfriend
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.680]  cheating on him in the park. It's the equivalent of these Hollywood stars that are fake sex
[28:21.680 --> 28:28.160]  tapes. I mean, wake up. I mean, these are operatives.
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.280]  I'm so glad I told Piers Morgan, you're the ones pushing suicide pills. It says on the
[28:32.280 --> 28:37.240]  insert to people causing this stuff. You're the one behind it. Shut up. Stop blaming me
[28:37.240 --> 28:42.240]  for killing those kids. That's what they tried to do. Now the whole thing's backfired on
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.240]  a big time, hadn't it?
[28:43.240 --> 28:47.480]  Let's go through the more police state articles here. But it's okay. I mean, they said the
[28:47.480 --> 28:53.120]  legal president killing Anwar al-Awlaki admitted CIA, born in America, trained by the Pentagon,
[28:53.120 --> 29:02.840]  black ops, special forces. I mean, give me a break. Stop being so naive people, okay?
[29:02.840 --> 29:10.400]  Stop being so naive. City in Virginia becomes first to pass anti-drone legislation, if I
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.400]  just say they'll ignore it.
[29:11.400 --> 29:14.960]  Why even have counties? Why have states? Why have cities? Just we have all powerful federal
[29:14.960 --> 29:18.760]  government run by foreign banks. That's all we need. There's another one. Nine states
[29:18.760 --> 29:23.260]  want to restrict use of drones over concerns about spying. This is good cuz at least they're
[29:23.260 --> 29:29.080]  acting like they're doing something. That's ABC, that's CBS AP.
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.760]  The problem is they'll just say, well, there's a slight restriction on it. All right, now
[29:34.760 --> 29:39.360]  I've gone over that. I haven't even gotten into one child policy enforcer, runs over
[29:39.360 --> 29:46.720]  baby after parents refuse to pay fines. This is how they do it now. The government holds
[29:46.720 --> 29:49.720]  you down while they put your kid in your front yard, run over it.
[29:49.720 --> 30:03.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[33:39.600 --> 33:47.580]  is a simulation. The DNA has it in there. They found out it's not 96% junk. It is an
[33:47.580 --> 33:55.520]  incredible crystalline antenna system with DNA sequences of all sorts of other life forms
[33:55.520 --> 33:56.520]  in it.
[33:56.520 --> 34:02.560]  And that's why so many people that are atheist and what does atheist means? It just means
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.920]  you're close minded. And you're sick of seeing fake preachers up there with limited spectrums
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.960]  or fake religions trying to interpret the true spirituality of the universe, which just
[34:12.960 --> 34:18.480]  means we are aware of things being much larger and then we don't have all the answers. And
[34:18.480 --> 34:22.240]  then some Bible thumping Christians will say, what? You're not subscribing to some Southern
[34:22.240 --> 34:23.720]  Baptist interpretation.
[34:23.720 --> 34:28.400]  I'm a radio talk show host who happens to have a relationship with God through Jesus
[34:28.400 --> 34:34.040]  Christ. But the issue here is if you didn't beat people over the head, they would become
[34:34.040 --> 34:39.240]  spiritual, which is the first step in awakening. One of the quickest ways to awaken. You can
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.660]  wake people up politically, and then they tend to wake up spiritually.
[34:44.660 --> 34:48.680]  And that's really my goal. I didn't do that on purpose, but now I'm a little bit more
[34:48.680 --> 34:57.080]  wise than I used to be and understand why God has used me as a tool. But all of us have
[34:57.080 --> 35:02.080]  free will. And so we're gonna be talking to Paul Watson about these amazing reports here
[35:02.080 --> 35:09.280]  in just a moment. He has a boil down up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com where he's
[35:09.280 --> 35:12.680]  got links to MIT and the scientific journals.
[35:12.680 --> 35:18.760]  Is the universe a computer simulation? Cosmic rays offer clue. Our universe could be a computer
[35:18.760 --> 35:23.080]  simulation and more. We're gonna be looking at all that. First off here, I already plugged
[35:23.080 --> 35:25.760]  two of these yesterday, but these are the new affiliates we've got in the last week
[35:25.760 --> 35:35.440]  and a half. WHSY950AM, Hattiesburg, Mississippi. WSDR 1240 AM, Sterling, Illinois. Again,
[35:35.440 --> 35:48.880]  that's WSDR 1240 AM, Sterling, Illinois. KIDO, 580 AM, Boise, Idaho. WYPV, 106.3 FM, Onaway,
[35:48.880 --> 35:58.560]  Michigan. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. KIXZ, 940 AM, Amarillo, Texas. WTNY, 790 AM,
[35:58.560 --> 36:09.800]  Watertown, New York. WSTP, 1490 AM, Salisbury, North Carolina. And again, they're adding
[36:09.800 --> 36:14.720]  all those up at gcnlive.com, the affiliates list that I've gone and looked at and it didn't
[36:14.720 --> 36:21.680]  even like have our local FM on 99.7 and a lot of other stuff on there, but we're compiling
[36:21.680 --> 36:22.680]  it.
[36:22.680 --> 36:26.480]  And then again, Genesis has always been a mom and pop operation. Now it's arguably the
[36:26.480 --> 36:30.920]  third or fourth largest syndicator in the country. I talked to Ted last week, got the
[36:30.920 --> 36:40.320]  actual numbers. Guess how many affiliates Genesis has? 13 plus 100, 1300 radio stations,
[36:40.320 --> 36:48.760]  1300 different ones. 1300, that is big, big. And what a launch pad for us. I mean, we've
[36:48.760 --> 36:50.720]  been here since Genesis started.
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.760]  We've grown together and now the show is getting two, three new affiliates a week and just
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.040]  I am so thankful. Cuz if I'm gonna get killed doing this, knock on wood, might as well go
[37:01.040 --> 37:10.160]  110%, huh? Man, I love the nature of reality. I love being awake. I love being real. I love
[37:10.160 --> 37:18.120]  stepping across that line. I love it. I love it. I love consciousness. I just thank God
[37:18.120 --> 37:19.120]  for consciousness.
[37:19.120 --> 37:26.680]  I just thank God for just being part of this magnificent creation that you have created.
[37:26.680 --> 37:34.040]  I can just feel the universe absolutely flowing right through me. The living waters. It's
[37:34.040 --> 37:40.640]  like, how could anybody be bored? How could anybody not be just absolutely bouncing off
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.320]  the walls with how incredible this is?
[37:44.320 --> 37:51.480]  And the animating contest of liberty, my test, your test, on the game grid right now against
[37:51.480 --> 37:59.560]  evil. What are you gonna do? I'm not worried about he who can kill the body, but he who
[37:59.560 --> 38:06.480]  kills the soul. The soul is as real as the sun in the sky and as light that you can't
[38:06.480 --> 38:09.960]  see except when it hits your cheek.
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.040]  But when there's dust in the air for a moment, you see the magic of the light. Your eye couldn't
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.080]  pick it up, but you could see it within the dust in the air or when it hit the waves in
[38:19.080 --> 38:22.440]  the water or went through the water in the air and made that rainbow.
[38:22.440 --> 38:32.520]  All right, I'm sorry. I'm thinking about the universe and that just happens. Briefly, before
[38:32.520 --> 38:41.120]  I compose myself into the Paul Joseph Watson joining us from all beyond the UK.
[38:41.120 --> 38:48.520]  Before we do that, I wanted to just remind you we are listeners supported. We are not
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.000]  funded by the New World Order or globalist or mega corporation. We're funded by listeners
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.440]  and viewers like you. You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month at infowarsnews.com, prisonplanet.tv,
[39:00.440 --> 39:02.120]  same URL gets you there.
[39:02.120 --> 39:07.000]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my films, special reports going back 17 years, 10 years
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.480]  of the site operating in April. But 17 years of material and it just gets better and better
[39:11.480 --> 39:15.040]  with our crew. And I wanna thank all you that have supported over the years, has worked
[39:15.040 --> 39:18.200]  the bugs out of it from the grassroots.
[39:18.200 --> 39:22.040]  And for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction. We are the response. You are
[39:22.040 --> 39:26.000]  the response to the tyranny. And you can see the exclusive behind the scenes Piers Morgan
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.300]  that's not even on YouTube yet up there in last night's show. The in-depth interviews
[39:31.300 --> 39:33.600]  are also going up tonight on the live show.
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.560]  We're doing a live 7 o'clock every night with Al Seed, the owner of the tactical firearms.
[39:39.560 --> 39:43.400]  Pretty amazing on the street interviews. That's all going up tonight. Just the crew here is
[39:43.400 --> 39:50.320]  doing a fabulous job. It's so good to know these souls. And I hope you'll go get prisonplanet.tv
[39:50.320 --> 39:55.840]  memberships. I mean, there's no excuse. We've got this at cost. And if everybody out there
[39:55.840 --> 40:01.000]  that has a membership, now 11 people can be tuned in simultaneously to get the video feed
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.720]  of the daytime radio show, the nighttime news show, all the films.
[40:04.720 --> 40:08.880]  You can simultaneously have 11 people logged on with the same username passcode. So create
[40:08.880 --> 40:12.640]  a unique username passcode, or if you already have one, there's a way to change it on the
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.440]  website. Or you can call customer service, they'll help you. And you change your username
[40:16.440 --> 40:19.960]  passcode. It's something that you already use for something else. Create a unique one
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.800]  and give it an e-cards or on a card to friends and family. Probably give it to about 20 people.
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.000]  And there won't be more than 11 tuning in at 7 o'clock. Most people won't tune in. So
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.800]  maybe give it to 30 people.
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.480]  And then if it gets maxed out, go get another membership. The point is, this is how we're
[40:35.480 --> 40:40.520]  going to defeat the globalist. And we need to explode this. You can also get 5.3 months
[40:40.520 --> 40:50.040]  off the year cost. You pay for 6.7 months and you get 5.3 months free with that new
[40:50.040 --> 40:53.560]  year special that's going to end very, very soon. I just haven't been plugging it so I'm
[40:53.560 --> 40:57.880]  running it into the middle of February. We do that once a year in December into January.
[40:57.880 --> 41:02.640]  So that's up at prisonplanet.tv. Support the alternative media. It takes about a minute

[41:59.440 --> 42:04.800]  is a big issue. And it's not just this report. I don't just trust one scientific report and
[42:04.800 --> 42:10.300]  then say, it must be true, it must be real. I have read the writings of top mathematicians,
[42:10.300 --> 42:15.020]  people like Einstein. You've seen the reports. I'm gonna do one coming up next week showing
[42:15.020 --> 42:22.160]  all the bio engineers, genetic engineers, mathematicians who were atheists or agnostics.
[42:22.160 --> 42:31.660]  But now with the incredible super electron microscopes and the cyclotrons and the super
[42:31.660 --> 42:39.400]  crunching computers, they are seeing the coding in everything and how fantastic it is. And
[42:39.400 --> 42:45.280]  are just saying, this was made, this was designed. Okay, and that's a good starting point for
[42:45.280 --> 42:49.700]  people. I've noticed atheists and I'm not attacking atheists out there, but most of
[42:49.700 --> 42:53.700]  them are like, I've had atheists before. I've run into the folks who do the local atheist
[42:53.700 --> 42:57.760]  TV show and I've been on the TV station and they're like, you believe there's some new
[42:57.760 --> 43:00.280]  world order in black helicopters?
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.120]  And at the TV station, I was actually hanging on the bulletin board when that happened an
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.240]  article about a military drill and I said, it's funny you said that. They're probably
[43:08.240 --> 43:11.260]  saying as they were jealous because that was in the newspaper. Look, they admit drills
[43:11.260 --> 43:17.480]  right here that I was right. They went, yeah, sure, this is a religion to you. So see, people
[43:17.480 --> 43:22.120]  that question, we're a conspiracy theorist, we question known liars, certified liars,
[43:22.120 --> 43:23.440]  that's weird.
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.780]  We say, look at the fantasticness of the universe. I resonate, I have insight, I know when somebody's
[43:28.780 --> 43:36.800]  looking at me from behind, I have pre cognitive powers, we all do to some extent or another.
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.240]  I mean, I know there's something going on here and the science just keeps proving it
[43:41.240 --> 43:46.360]  with the cells in plants and in animals and butterflies and fish where they are picking
[43:46.360 --> 43:52.440]  up electromagnetic feedback and light from the sun and they've excised these sensors.
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.560]  They're also in the human brain and also in the stomach and expose them to radiation from
[43:57.560 --> 43:59.200]  space and they're resonating with it.
[43:59.200 --> 44:04.280]  I mean, we are just filled with receivers. I mean, we are incredible creatures and it's
[44:04.280 --> 44:13.080]  all science. It's not quacky kookiness and they don't want you knowing that. They don't
[44:13.080 --> 44:18.080]  want you getting sunshine. They want you inside in the TV with its fake light programming
[44:18.080 --> 44:22.840]  your eyes. They know the sunlight goes right into your eyes and activates the pineal gland
[44:22.840 --> 44:23.840]  and other areas of your brain.
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.120]  They know all this. Now, I'm gonna go to Paul Watson for the balance of the hour. He shot
[44:27.120 --> 44:31.020]  a great video report with a bunch of news articles linked under it. Is the universe
[44:31.020 --> 44:37.520]  a computer simulation up at prisonplanet.com right now? Cosmic rays offer clue our universe
[44:37.520 --> 44:44.120]  could be a computer simulation and that's a Wired magazine. MIT, the idea we live in
[44:44.120 --> 44:47.120]  a simulation isn't science fiction.
[44:47.120 --> 44:53.080]  MIT technology review, the measurement that would reveal the universe is a computer simulation.
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.400]  And then it goes down to, as they look at it, it's freaking them out because it appears
[44:57.400 --> 45:02.780]  to be a simulation, not random as they've claimed. Now, again, every field keeps finding
[45:02.780 --> 45:09.160]  this. Paul Watson joining us from our London Bureau over at prisonplanet.com has followed
[45:09.160 --> 45:10.160]  a video report on this.
[45:10.160 --> 45:11.160]  Paul Watson, break it down.
[45:11.160 --> 45:18.280]  Hi, it's good to be here. Yeah, it's funny you were just mentioning skeptics saying cutting
[45:18.280 --> 45:23.440]  is up even for talking about this. There was a comment, Infowars is jumping the shark by
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.520]  covering this. And not only is it being discussed and it has been discussed for years by cutting
[45:30.520 --> 45:36.420]  edge science, you just mentioned MIT, Wired magazine, New Scientist. I mean, Plato was
[45:36.420 --> 45:42.220]  talking about it what, nearly 2,500 years ago with the allegory of the cave, which you've
[45:42.220 --> 45:47.240]  played on the show before. You know, Rene Descartes was talking about it 400 years ago
[45:47.240 --> 45:53.240]  with his evil demon philosophy, this whole idea that an illusion is created to distract
[45:53.240 --> 45:56.260]  us to divert us from reality.
[45:56.260 --> 46:00.500]  So it's far from jumping the shark. It's basically what everybody's talking about on the
[46:00.500 --> 46:07.100]  cutting edge of science now. And the video I made about it was just a collation of articles
[46:07.100 --> 46:15.720]  about a University of Bonn experiment in Germany undertaken by scientists who basically discovered
[46:15.720 --> 46:22.160]  through a calculation in which they use one tiny part of the universe that when cosmic
[46:22.160 --> 46:27.820]  rays fly through this part of the universe and dissipate, they don't do so randomly.
[46:27.820 --> 46:34.400]  They do so with an energy that's, quote, consistent with the kind of boundary that you'd find
[46:34.400 --> 46:40.320]  if there was an underlying lattice governing the limits of a simulator. So basically they're
[46:40.320 --> 46:46.760]  saying that the movement and behavior of cosmic rays suggests that they're performing exactly
[46:46.760 --> 46:53.280]  as you would expect them to perform if they were trapped inside a giant computer simulation
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.760]  which we call the universe. And it's based, they based it, the foundation of it on Moore's
[46:58.760 --> 47:04.320]  law which of course dictates that approximately every two years computer power doubles. So
[47:04.320 --> 47:10.120]  eventually humanity is going to get to the stage where computers are so powerful that
[47:10.120 --> 47:14.740]  they can artificially create a reality which is virtually indistinguishable from what we
[47:14.740 --> 47:22.160]  call reality now. Which begs the question, of course, how do we know that we're not already
[47:22.160 --> 47:29.160]  living inside a computer simulation? And the reaction to this video so far from several
[47:29.160 --> 47:34.480]  people is, well, if we are living inside a computer simulation, if we are living inside
[47:34.480 --> 47:40.220]  a matrix, then what's the point? Life is pointless. We're just a plaything, a science project
[47:40.220 --> 47:45.200]  for either some future race or whatever. But, you know, I look at it the opposite way. If
[47:45.200 --> 47:50.100]  that is proven, which science is increasingly showing that it is the case, that we're probably
[47:50.100 --> 47:55.840]  living inside an artificial created universe, then that is proof of a creator, isn't it?
[47:55.840 --> 48:01.760]  Well, the universe was void and then God spoke it, thought it, and it was made. And that's
[48:01.760 --> 48:07.480]  what they find in every discipline now is that it's designed, and the human word computer
[48:07.480 --> 48:14.440]  isn't even proper in all of this. There is a governing structure. They can see the modulation
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.680]  and off of the projection of the time-space continuum, off of just one of the reading,
[48:18.680 --> 48:24.920]  these cosmic rays, they continue to see particles that should be flowing at different rates
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.240]  and modulations with an overall modulation and they can tune it and begin to see the
[48:29.240 --> 48:32.520]  structure of the containment system.
[48:32.520 --> 48:40.000]  And it's contained within the thought process of the creator, of God, of the great architect
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.200]  as the Illuminati calls it, but that's actually a biblical term, which they've stolen. And
[48:44.200 --> 48:50.360]  so it is the construction. And what does the creator tell us? You are made in my image.
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.640]  You are creators as well, but small creators. And so it is literally the consciousness and
[48:56.640 --> 49:03.400]  the will of God creating all of this, but then giving us free will, which is then flowing
[49:03.400 --> 49:07.400]  forth a whole new level of creation.
[49:07.400 --> 49:14.240]  Well, precisely. And I mean, the way they explained it was, think of a chess board,
[49:14.240 --> 49:19.940]  you can only move a chess piece a minimum of one move, one square on the board. These
[49:19.940 --> 49:26.300]  cosmic rays, when they modulate them against this lattice structure, only move uniformly
[49:26.300 --> 49:30.080]  along this lattice structure. They're not random. So that's why they're saying that
[49:30.080 --> 49:36.960]  it shows that it's probably a computer-generated simulation. And I mean, you know, if we think
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.520]  about it every night, we create our own mini simulation in our dreams.
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.440]  We can move around an environment, we can interact with people and objects.
[49:46.440 --> 49:51.700]  Which is a fourth and fifth dimension projection, which many equations show is actually affecting
[49:51.700 --> 49:59.760]  the universe at some type of galactic level. Yeah, so if one human brain can do that, then
[49:59.760 --> 50:05.820]  imagine what a supercomputer or a creator call it what you will, with trillions of times
[50:05.820 --> 50:09.800]  the power of one human brain, imagine what they could create with that kind of power.
[50:09.800 --> 50:15.440]  Well, the way my dad describes it is like a dragonfly's eye, and that humans are literally
[50:15.440 --> 50:23.160]  like the compound eyes of a dragonfly through which God is looking. Imagine that. And then
[50:23.160 --> 50:24.640]  it's a manifestation.
[50:24.640 --> 50:30.680]  Well, yeah, because every sense that goes through the human brain is processed, isn't
[50:30.680 --> 50:35.880]  it? It's an electrical impulse, which goes back to the whole brain in a vat theory. You
[50:35.880 --> 50:40.520]  know, since our brain is merely this decoder of electrical signals, how do we know we're
[50:40.520 --> 50:46.040]  not a brain in a vat? How do we know anything really when we are a brain in a vat inside
[50:46.040 --> 50:52.400]  this electrochemical bodysuit, Earth suit, combat suit? I mean, that's it.
[50:52.400 --> 50:57.880]  This is for the car consciousness, our spirit to have this experience on this plane. And
[50:57.880 --> 51:02.600]  that's why I don't fear death. I mean, I feel God I know attention gardeners and patriots
[51:02.600 --> 51:06.940]  drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive Federal Reserve debt monetizing
[51:06.940 --> 51:12.040]  are creating the perfect conditions for dramatically higher food prices in the months ahead. That
[51:12.040 --> 51:16.680]  means there has never been a better time to secure an ongoing source of nutritionally

[54:06.440 --> 54:12.520]  And ladies and gentlemen the system wants to keep your mind down here on earth. We are
[54:12.520 --> 54:19.000]  in the world but not of it. They want to keep you artificially focused on ugly things, twisted
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.960]  things. We have to cover their crimes but not because we want to keep you focused on
[54:22.960 --> 54:29.080]  ugliness so that you know they're the authors of ugliness and pain and suffering. The creator
[54:29.080 --> 54:34.720]  of the universe is the author of exaltation and enlightenment and life and gifts and bounty
[54:34.720 --> 54:39.480]  and honor and everything good and just wants to give it all to us.
[54:39.480 --> 54:46.920]  Everything just flowing endless, endless gifts. And the enemy, the virus in the system wants
[54:46.920 --> 54:52.080]  to pull us down, wants torture. Imagine our government's torture is good, secret arrest.
[54:52.080 --> 54:56.800]  Yeah, we torture people's kids. The public's like that's terrible. Okay, we'll stop doing
[54:56.800 --> 55:00.560]  that. They should all go to jail. They're all a bunch of perverts. They're all a bunch
[55:00.560 --> 55:07.520]  of sickos. And again, it's not the judgment, no one's perfect. It's that they're willfully
[55:07.520 --> 55:09.200]  love the darkness.
[55:09.200 --> 55:16.600]  It's beautiful to them. Okay, and beauty is ugly to them. And it's not just this, there's
[55:16.600 --> 55:20.560]  these big computer models. It's not just them, it's MIT, others have found this. And a lot
[55:20.560 --> 55:25.000]  of the people are becoming religious. And they're realizing it's a guild meant to control
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.920]  them, just like modern churches and mainline religion is meant to control you and suppress
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.480]  you. So is the whole atheist and agnostic movement.
[55:32.480 --> 55:37.160]  They teach it scientific and it's avant garde to say there is no God. The fool has said
[55:37.160 --> 55:43.680]  in his heart there is no God. The evidence of God is written in the heavens. It's written
[55:43.680 --> 55:50.440]  in the plants. It's written in your children. It's written in your eyes. And the system
[55:50.440 --> 55:55.120]  knows this and wants to be God itself. You understand that?
[55:55.120 --> 56:00.760]  It is a false creation, an abomination, but it can't create. It has to take God's creations
[56:00.760 --> 56:05.720]  and twist it. But everything it does turns into a curse. I don't mean to be preaching,
[56:05.720 --> 56:10.120]  I apologize. I don't really apologize, I got all this news to cover. We got all that coming
[56:10.120 --> 56:11.120]  up in the next hour.
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.040]  But Paul Watson finish up in the last three minutes, my friend.
[56:14.040 --> 56:19.980]  Yeah, another interesting thing is that they found these error correcting codes, which
[56:19.980 --> 56:24.760]  is similar to the ones in computers. They've basically found them to be inherent in the
[56:24.760 --> 56:32.520]  very nature of reality and the universe itself. So again, that directly suggests intelligent
[56:32.520 --> 56:38.720]  design. And it all phases in with this new study out of the University of Bonn. So basically,
[56:38.720 --> 56:42.960]  they found that the cosmic rays, the way they behave, the way they move, the way the energy
[56:42.960 --> 56:50.380]  dissipates fits in with the notion that it is a computer generated simulation, that there's
[56:50.380 --> 56:56.480]  lattice structures underpinning it, which inherently show intelligent design. So it's
[56:56.480 --> 57:01.720]  not to say that we're all pointless, our lives are pointless. We're just an imagination of
[57:01.720 --> 57:08.560]  somebody else's science project. The universe is littered with evidence that it has intelligent
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.680]  design. And it's just so exciting to get into this kind of topic, which is why I think you're
[57:13.680 --> 57:18.220]  going to start digging into it even more. And there are several major scientists now
[57:18.220 --> 57:25.400]  coming out with this evidence. One of them is Nick Bostrom at Oxford University. So it's
[57:25.400 --> 57:33.440]  an exciting cutting edge field of science, and that's why I find it interesting.
[57:33.440 --> 57:37.320]  All right, Paul. So bottom line, this needs to be investigated more. And I think we should
[57:37.320 --> 57:41.780]  do special reports showing all the other scientists that are now discovering this, many of them
[57:41.780 --> 57:46.200]  again who were atheists. And they're not saying, hey, I believe in the Baptist Church or the
[57:46.200 --> 57:51.840]  Catholic Church or the Muslims now, they're saying this is designed. And this is fractal
[57:51.840 --> 57:55.800]  design. And I mean, it's all right there. And people need to understand, folks, that
[57:55.800 --> 58:00.480]  what you're seeing and what's on this planet, this isn't everything. People 300 years ago
[58:00.480 --> 58:03.680]  would have thought what we have today would have been magic and would have thought we
[58:03.680 --> 58:04.680]  were gods.
[58:04.680 --> 58:08.600]  Now, again, I'm saying there is a God. I'm not saying we're going to become gods. I'm
[58:08.600 --> 58:13.640]  not saying it's a perspective of gods. I'm saying that, yeah, no, the creator made the
[58:13.640 --> 58:19.840]  entire universe. That's God. And we're able to decode just parts of it because we are
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.600]  given a spark of that. Anything else? Paul? No, that's it, Alex. All right. Great job,
[58:25.600 --> 58:30.340]  my friend. Your reports up at prison planet dot com is the universe of computer simulation
[58:30.340 --> 58:34.360]  and the top scientists and huge computer programs are saying, yes, they can literally see the
[58:34.360 --> 58:43.400]  fingerprints, they can see the plumbing, they can see the magnetic field contained.
[58:43.400 --> 58:51.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.400 --> 58:56.080]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[58:56.080 --> 59:01.720]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[59:30.200 --> 59:35.380]  skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while

[59:53.640 --> 01:00:05.400]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.440]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:36.520]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.560]  We've got a victim of the incredible Illinois police state, Jennifer Stahl, joining us via
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.600]  video Skype on the syndicated radio transmission in the next segment. I had a very profound
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.920]  discussion just now with Paul Joseph Watson. And if you don't get excited about the nature
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.840]  of consciousness and the nature of the fact that you are an eternal being with a spirit,
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:02.000]  deciding what dimension you're going to reside in, that with all that is negative and destructive
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.840]  or with the creator, if that doesn't excite you and just get your soul resonating, then
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.780]  I really feel sorry for you. That's all I can say. Because with awareness of this knowledge,
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:27.320]  the universe opens up with the keys. It's really Solomon's keys.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:35.560]  All right, my friends, where do we begin here? I've already gone over the out-of-control
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.160]  police state information. I'm going to get more into that. The news of torture bases
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.960]  everywhere continuing. Of course, the warrantless wiretapping. They'll kill you with drones
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.560]  of America if they want. No judge, no jury, no proof you're even a terrorist. We'll just
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.320]  kill you if we want.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.560]  Just over the top. Just over the top, absolute, convicted themselves, total criminals. And
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.000]  the media's like, well, I guess it's good to kill whoever you want. Yeah, torture's
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.440]  kind of good. It's liberal. It's got a peace prize. Do you got a peace prize?
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:11.000]  Hey, it looks like Michelle Obama's gaining weight. Racist. I think torturing kids all
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.600]  over the world in front of their parents is pretty bad. That's racist. I don't want to
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:25.320]  turn my gun in. It's racist. So that's all coming up. So ridiculous. The propaganda that
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.320]  they've got aimed at the public is designed for people with IQs of about 80 points.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.040]  But even their higher grade propaganda they put out to the intelligentsia is for people
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:40.720]  with about 85 IQ. I mean, it's like all in slow motion. But you realize people that are
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.040]  captured by it aren't even really stupid. It is ignorance. It's more than ignorance.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.120]  It's a trance. It's like somebody brought up in a barn from birth who never was even
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.840]  told there was an outside world, never heard sounds, never was brought outside. It's the
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.480]  allegory of the cave. Growing up in a 2,000 square foot metal box under the ground and
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.480]  food's just delivered down to you and a television set talks to you.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.800]  Well, that'd be a good allegory of the cave film to shoot. I bet who did that might be
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.480]  the winner of the 100,000 bucks. So I just have millions of these ideas. We should redo
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.000]  the Plato's allegory of the cave and just show someone growing up with a television
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.660]  and maybe a robot in a system like this is the universe. This is the world. This is everything.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.800]  You are a parakeet. But they're not really. I mean, it's just ridiculous. And then the
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.280]  world is just a series of more of those boxes.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.800]  And I know you're listening going, you're right. You're right. You know this. I'm not
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:44.960]  telling you something that's, well, it shouldn't be profound. But it is profound. We should
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.560]  play the allegory of the cave coming up later. We'll do that at the bottom of the hour. The
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:56.400]  Horace and Wells rendition of it from the 70s. Remind me to do that. I'm not coughing
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:02.200]  because I have a chest issue now. I bullhorned for an hour and a half and screamed a bunch
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.200]  more at Piers Morgan there in Katy, as you know.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:13.640]  So I have flame broiled my larynx as usual for the signature voice. I haven't bullhorned
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.760]  or screamed in a few months. It actually has that deep voice for that weird Texas high
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.200]  twang over. It's weird voice. I talk to big voice actors and voice over folks. They have
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.800]  a very unique voice. I'm bragging about a unique voice. It's a weird hammered out voice.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:33.800]  It's like whatever it is. Oh, no, it sounds like a Easter bunny on PCP. Anyways, ladies
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.360]  and gentlemen, I'm going to get serious here. I start talking about the universe, the nature
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.560]  of reality. It absolutely just gets me in a good mood.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:49.000]  We shall return after this quick break. And we are going to get into the one child policy
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.760]  enforcer crushes baby to death. Her parents refused to pay fine. That's up at info wars.com
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.640]  and our media is defending it. What do you got to get rid of a baby?

[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.360]  family and I made it through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.840]  the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.680]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. My friends at E Foods Direct hear
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.600]  from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply

[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.320]  Almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.360]  to be able to help my sister and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.520]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:21.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:36.080]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they're now officially telling us that drones will just kill us.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.200]  No judge, no jury. We don't even need to be terrorists. We don't even need to be planning
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.480]  anything. They'll just kill us. And they're saying, well, under the new America, they
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.480]  don't need warrants to listen to your phone calls or read your emails.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.200]  And in the new America, I've got articles, cops man random revenue enhancement checkpoints
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.480]  in Florida, all over the country. Texas now has them. You're on major highway side streets,
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.520]  you just pull up to a checkpoint. And they go, we're gonna look at your license, insurance,
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.400]  registration. We're gonna dig through your car. Sometimes the Army's out there, sometimes
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.880]  the TSA's out there.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.920]  Meanwhile, they're putting smart meters, and this started about ten years ago in California.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.520]  Enron had come up with the idea about 15 years ago, but after they went to jail in 2002,
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.240]  the plan still went ahead in California. And the original plan was to control the temperature
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.760]  in your house remotely.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.960]  It would dial into all the new appliances that were gonna come out, computers, washers,
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.840]  dryers, you name it, and spy on you. And we had the director of the CIA, now disgraced,
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.120]  come out and say, hey, we've got great new intelligence. We just use the new washers
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.040]  and dryers. They've got systems that spy on you.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.000]  And we just hijack and decode everything off your computer, like the Google cars driving
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.240]  around. And even when they have wireless meter readers that on the surface sound good. Yeah,
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:54.200]  now you don't have meter readers, it just wirelessly reads it. The problem is that it
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.840]  then reads everything else, and this is on record.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:09.000]  And so secret arrest, torture, all this coming out, just incredible police state news unfolding
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.440]  in this country. And I have seen this all over the nation. You've seen it in the news
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.720]  where people will videotape police at a demonstration, or people will videotape police in their front
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.720]  yard.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.740]  Or I've seen the footage of a guy in Arkansas videotaping cops from his garage across the
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.680]  street while they got somebody pulled over. And they come over, they come in his garage,
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.960]  he says, please leave. And they go, no, we're arresting you for interfering for videotaping
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:40.840]  from his garage down the driveway across the street at them pulling over his neighbor.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:45.860]  And they arrest him, and the police chief says, that's good, we will. So you saw the
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:50.120]  case last year that we covered here on air, that guys typed this in. I wanna show it to
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.640]  TV viewers, radio listeners, man faces life in prison for taping and filming police in
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640]  Illinois.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.480]  And they sent the Attorney General in with a briefing, telling the county, we want him
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:07.880]  put in jail for life. For life with all the charges of the times he had taped the police
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:13.720]  cuz they were shutting down with zoning people his junkyard and hauling off his classic cars.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.400]  You don't do that in America, you don't go and argue with them and tape them. Man faces
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.360]  life in jail for recording police show, there's the article, 41-year-old Illinois mechanic
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.120]  Michael Allison faced life in prison and the state said, yes, we want life in prison.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.800]  Now again, that's like North Korea. But I wanna show you here, if you're watching on
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:40.520]  TV, if not, just go to the Chicago Tribune. Two meter opponents arrested in Naperville
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:47.380]  or Naperville, a society of violating one another. That's the weird headline. And the
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:52.800]  media is like, man, this is good, I mean, these are bad people.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:58.440]  You've got a couple moms, the neighbor in an upscale neighborhood. It has them going
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.840]  over their fence without warrants, they're putting it on the house. They've got a group
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.320]  against the smart meters, they're suing them. They're in court, trying to go through the
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.200]  process. And the cops just show up looking like guys out of Goodfellas. Just totally
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.360]  arrogant and are like, your feet are gonna be cold cuz the woman had run out in the cold
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.360]  to videotape it.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.040]  And then they came back the next day and look at their mugshots, look at them. These are
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:32.160]  evil people. Jennifer Stahl left and her friend Kim, I mean, absolutely devilish in America
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:39.780]  with a video camera on the sidewalk in public. There is no perception of privacy in public.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.360]  That's how the cops have cameras in their cars, cameras on their glasses. That's how
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.760]  you can have cameras.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.960]  But Illinois and at least 13 other states on record arrest, arrest, and they don't care
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.760]  how many times it gets thrown out. They sometimes find juries that will convict and the people
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.760]  then get out of prison on appeal. Just like they charged this 10-year-old who had a toy
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.800]  water gun with brandishing a weapon just saying, hey, let's play water gun.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.240]  That's in the news. We're gonna go to our guests here in just a moment. But I wanted
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.000]  to break this background down for the listeners that just tuned in. This is in the news today
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.720]  in my Second Amendment stack right here, right here. Alexandria cop busts 10-year-old boy
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.080]  for bringing toy gun to school.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.720]  He's on the bus with a little water gun. And he showed it to his friend, his water gun,
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.400]  that's almost as bad as a Hello Kitty bubble gun, saying let's just play with it after
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.840]  school. Didn't even have one. And he's been arrested. He's charged with brandishing a
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.760]  weapon. That's out of the Washington Examiner. Good, I think you should go to executing.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.200]  I mean, North Korea wouldn't do that, but we need to be more extreme than North Korea
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.560]  because the state is God.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.240]  Now I'm gonna play a few minutes of this clip, the audio for radio listeners, video for prisonplanet.tv
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.360]  viewers. We are becoming a prison planet. And they came and arrested them for putting
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:01.760]  it on YouTube as just pure retribution. And they're charging them with interfering with
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.520]  police and a bunch of the stuff, big jail sentences, for politely going, hey, we're
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.520]  in court with you guys.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.240]  You don't have a right to be going there. And just standing there, and the cops come
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.840]  over to them and say you can't film us. I mean, it's just imagine the dishonorableness,
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.480]  the evil of going to the upscale neighborhood. My point is they're already attacking the
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.020]  poor people, bad cops are.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.240]  Not all cops are bad, but Illinois, other areas, it's really getting bad. And people
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:33.120]  need to stand up and say no. Imagine, imagine going and knocking on the door. All right,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.140]  come here, let's get the handcuffs on you. We're gonna talk to one of those women here
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:42.220]  in just a moment. And then throwing the book at them, a fake book of a fraud of a law that
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:46.080]  doesn't even apply, wiretapping is what the smart meter does.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.480]  That's the incredible irony of this. It hooks to your house, spiders in all the new appliances,
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.280]  you can't buy them. The government on records going into Goodwills and stuff in a program
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.440]  and saying these appliances waste energy, so we have a program to buy up and destroy
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  all appliances.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.580]  No, no, no, no, no. They're gonna ban all your old cars, everything. The black boxes
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:11.160]  are going in, I got those articles. This is a total grid. We're gonna go to our guests
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.880]  in a moment. The others, their lawyers have told them not to. I guess plea bargain, whatever,
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:22.200]  for filming in your own yard, civil rights violation lawsuit, official oppression.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.280]  Violation of the Fourth Amendment, just sue them. They're violently arresting you. They're
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:32.920]  violently demonizing you and the press. They're using force on you. Use the force on them
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:38.200]  of the courts. The people in Illinois who are good people, I got family lives up there,
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:43.600]  should stand up, should stand up and say this is enough, mafia.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.040]  But the Don wants everybody's guns in Illinois. The Don wants all of Illinois to be like Chicago
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.400]  and totally take over. We're on the radio in Chicago. Now let's go ahead. Let's go ahead
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.720]  and go to this tape and then we'll go to our guests. But I wanted to give you some background,
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.680]  try to get you out of your coma out there, that this is what America has become.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680]  Here's the video.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:09.400]  Here's UPA installers crossing over locked fences and against consent.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.160]  By the way, this neighbor is in her yard videotaping the gods.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160]  With police-
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  Not allowed to be in your own yard.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.160]  They are crossing-
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.160]  On the sidewalk.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.720]  Over locked fences. Laura, do you give consent to have this meter installed?
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.600]  No, absolutely not. This is putting my child in harm's way. My child has a chronic illness
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.200]  and it could affect her illness and make it worse.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:37.480]  How dare women stand in their own driveway and film police arrest them, arrest them.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.320]  Okay, so police are now crossing locked fences-
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:46.560]  Look how arrogant these guys are, man. Can you imagine being them? Can you imagine being
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.560]  that type of-
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  Laura, do you give consent to this officer to go out for property?
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:57.560]  He's not protecting me, he's protecting the city. It's like a dictatorship.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.840]  It's all funny. Hey, you won, didn't you, cops?
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:05.880]  You got to put the women in jail. Yeah, you'll do more than that later, right? It's the time
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.880]  of the government coming, right?
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.280]  So, Laura, you're the homeowner. Those two men that are on your property-
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.520]  How can you go to sleep and have a good conscience?
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.880]  Ooh, got arrested for that, for nicely speaking to their conscience.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.200]  Do you give consent for this to people at UPA?
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]  This is North Korea.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200]  Absolutely not.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.080]  All right, that's enough. I'm gonna go to our guest. We're gonna have another 20 minutes
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.520]  or so. I really appreciate Jennifer Stahl joining us. It's time for everybody in Illinois.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.840]  And we're on like five stations in Illinois, including Chicago. I want to see thousands
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.760]  of people marching. I want to see this brought out in the open. I want to see that police
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.760]  department sued.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:46.120]  I want to see people out there getting back in the Chicago mafia's face that's trying
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.480]  to take the whole state down and say, we're not your slaves. This isn't North Korea. And
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.760]  they've got a group fighting the smart meters. We got to stand with these women. Now, we
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.840]  are, again, joined here by one of the neighbors who was arrested, Jennifer Stahl.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.360]  I just showed you the Chicago Tribune. Tell us about what happened to you. We're gonna
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.240]  break in two minutes. We're gonna come back and give you the floor here. What you're facing
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.800]  and where all this is going. Thank you for joining us.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:16.000]  Hi, thanks for having me on. You want me to just to tell you what happened in my-
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.760]  Sure, you've heard my rant. Let's first talk about you and your neighbors, the group you've
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.440]  got, what's happening with the smart meters.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:27.840]  Oh boy, where do I start? I've been, I was originally interested in the topic and thought,
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.520]  I'm actually kind of a, you know, I'm an energy conservation type person and I thought, oh,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.400]  this will be nice. I can have more opportunity to know how I can save energy by having a
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.280]  smart meter on my house. And then somebody said that, you know, did you know that people
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.880]  are getting sick from these? So I started to research and found that there was an issue
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.920]  and then other people are said, look at the privacy issues and the security risk and the
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:54.720]  fact that these things are causing fires and, you know, just the cost alone is a big issue
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:00.080]  as well. So everybody that was concerned from various perspectives all joined together and
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.480]  said, this is an issue and we need to take this to the city. And this, our group was
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:09.000]  formulated literally exactly two years ago. And so we formed a group called Naperville
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.160]  Smart Meter Awareness and we created a nonprofit from that. And our goal really was to educate
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.160]  people so that people would really understand what this meant to them before they would
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.840]  allow this to be on their home and then also to advocate for everybody in Naperville to
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.440]  have the right to refuse. And the thing is, is that in Naperville, I should set the framework
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:35.680]  for people to understand is that the city of Naperville is a municipal, they own the
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.320]  utility. So we're not up against an investment owned utility. It's literally the city and
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:46.080]  the city of Naperville provides the power. All right, stay there. We're gonna come right
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.360]  back and talk about Naperville with you and the whole smart meter issue. And again, if
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.040]  you don't know, folks, it's on record. It dials into all your appliances and spies on
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:00.920]  you. It's basically a robot attached to the side of your house, an imperial probe droid.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:05.720]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.360]  to the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.560]  the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.100]  lost everything. My friends at e foods direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:23.380]  to weather life storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny from New York City wrote
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:28.040]  in following Hurricane Sandy and said almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.440]  to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister and my niece. Bottom line,
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:37.280]  it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day too late. Heed common senses warning

[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:08.080]  there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:14.040]  Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.720]  greatest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.000]  House Newt Gingrich wrote an op ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.960]  threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this. It may be because the
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.300]  liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend just created
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:39.420]  a free video at weird device.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:45.160]  Go watch the shocking video at weird device.com right now to discover exactly what it is.

[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:24.040]  40 after that. I'm gonna blitz through news ahead of another special report we're gonna
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.040]  be doing and your phone calls in the third hour here. Now I was just talking to Melissa
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:35.200]  Melton, one of our reporters, about when she was going to UT, the university, and how they
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.240]  had smart meters in there that would actually go and make noise and change when you walked
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.240]  in the dorm.
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.700]  And here's NBC News. Just type in smart meter spy. San Francisco Chronicle. It's not just
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:53.920]  us saying the smart electricity meters can be used to spy on private homes. They even
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.480]  know when you're sleeping, when you're away, and what film you're watching on TV. Did you
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:05.840]  hear that? And then the cops come and stick them on your house, and they are a high-tech
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:15.080]  robot, stuck on the side of your house, that's, imperial probe droid, grabbing everything
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.200]  that's going on. I mean, this is so diabolical.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.960]  And it's admitted. I talked about this 10 years ago, cuz it was an MIT magazine. It's
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:29.080]  like, yeah, right, sure. And now they're just going, we don't care. It's not just something
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:35.040]  that digitally meters that can then wire back to something. It's a giant spy grid that they
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.120]  make you pay for in the price.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.240]  That's another way to, I'm gonna shut up. I got our guest. She's with us this segment
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:46.400]  of the next. Let's go back to Jennifer Stahl, who was arrested in America for filming the
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.060]  police, which is not illegal. But finish up with the smart meters, and then let's get
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:54.760]  to now, I guess your upcoming trial with your accomplice.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:59.320]  I guess just being with you while there was videotaping going on is now a serious crime.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.320]  Go ahead.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:07.880]  Well, our organization was informing everybody in the city. And many people have brought
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.680]  things to the city council because they're essentially the executive board of our electric
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:19.320]  utilities, city-owned municipal utilities. So Naperville is an island amongst so many
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:25.560]  other major utilities, investor-owned utilities like ComEd. And the city decided, the city
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.040]  council was given an opportunity and said, hey, look, we can get $11 million from the
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.600]  American Recovering Reinvestment Act. And they did a money grab, took $11 million because
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.880]  it's free money, of course.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.560]  The federal government pays to put these spy devices on your house. This is an NSA spy
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.120]  device. Go ahead.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.560]  So the city, our city has very reliable electric power, which is why we were challenging from
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:54.000]  a financial perspective alone, why is it that you're doing this? And it doesn't make sense
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.160]  to spend this much money on the benefits that you say are really not that great. So we really
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:05.080]  challenged that a lot. It's supposedly a $22 million project. They did a money grab and
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:11.560]  took these funds. So we challenged the city. Many people contacted them, spoke in front
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.200]  of city council meetings for a couple of years, really honestly, and challenged them to say
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.280]  you need to understand the ramifications. You think this is a good thing. You think
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:25.120]  you're just going to eliminate meter readers. But it's actually at the cost. You're robbing
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:31.800]  from Peter to pay Paul is what I've consistently said. You're in the health, the privacy, security.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.600]  How many, how many security analysts are you going to keep on hand to protect our grid
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.000]  from getting shut down from a terrorist when terrorists are working 24 by seven around
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  the world?
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.040]  Yeah. Working in cyber command. Yeah. Now, now expanding on this, they say it's the lower
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.240]  prices for you. It's well known. They use these to gouge people everywhere.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:53.600]  Yes, it's, that's, we've seen that and we've heard reports and then you see it's a stepping
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.640]  stone as an opportunity for them to go to time abuse pricing as a, as a standard and
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.440]  not as an option, which the city has made. Everything is optional demand response where
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.440]  they, you can give them control if you opt for them to do that over your air conditioner
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.880]  or your pool heater or something like that. Those are all optional programs, which they've,
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.600]  you know, when people started swapping at them and saying, this is a problem, they,
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.720]  Oh, well, well, it's all going to be optional. And I said, well, if everything's optional,
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.080]  then why aren't you making the meter optional? This was meant to be an opt in program from
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:28.080]  the energy policy act of 2005 that the federal government enacted right on our website. It
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:33.820]  shows very, very plainly and clearly in a paragraph that says smart meters and time
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:38.800]  abuse pricing or automated metering infrastructure, AMI. It's another word that they're getting
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.920]  away from calling the smart meters because people are catching on. If you look right
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:48.840]  in the very plain English that the energy policy act of 2005 states, they are, utilities
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.740]  are supposed to offer it, make it available upon request for an opt in program. We really
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:58.560]  have urged the city to take a step back and make it an opt in program because everything
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:03.280]  is optional. You're wasting $22 million on something that really isn't going to be taken
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.400]  advantage of. They estimated all sorts of things. I could, I'm getting off track with
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.100]  the the financials, but, um, so the city proceeded and they said, no, we're right. There's nothing
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:17.000]  wrong with them. They're not a health risk. They're proven to be safe, which of course
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.880]  is completely false. There's no, no proof anywhere on a study that shows that the smart
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.020]  meters are safe, um, from a health perspective or a safety. And for that matter, they're
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:30.000]  not UL listed. All right, stay there, ma'am. And again, we have an extremist on. I want
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.740]  to apologize to all listeners. A woman with her next door neighbor dared video police
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:40.360]  from the sidewalk without a warrant installing a giant spy device. This is, I'm sorry, Kim
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.420]  Jung Il was very upset from his grave in North Korea that a woman would dare stand up to
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:48.120]  him in uniform. This is a thought criminal. We'll come back with the extremist. Stay with
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.260]  us. She's very frightening. Oh my gosh. We're on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex

[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:11.280]  I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on me, shame
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:18.120]  on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again. He aligns himself with the truth and it's
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:25.120]  time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:33.120]  Yeah, smart meters are a scam at every level and we don't oppose them because we're anti-technology.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:37.960]  It's like a gun is technology, a car is technology, a computer is. It's that it's loaded up with
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:43.960]  Trojan horses you've got to pay for. It's designed where they can double, triple charge
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.480]  you. That's what Ken Lay and Enron designed it for and it's a giant boondoggle where the
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.040]  government gives billions and we're talking about in her small town, tens of millions,
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.880]  was it 20 million, to pay to put things on that if they were really a tiny little wireless
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:03.360]  system that just read it might cost a couple hundred dollars be encased and then it goes
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.960]  back to the wireless thing and then you don't have meter readers.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.000]  But the point is then that gets rid of the human element, it gets rid of jobs and it
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.640]  overall doesn't even save you money but instead it's these big giant units slapped on there
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:20.760]  depending on the unit that dial in. Have you gone and tried to buy a coffee maker, a TV,
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:28.560]  a computer, a washer, a dryer, a refrigerator, a Cuisinart. I mean they're coming out with
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:33.720]  Michelin tires and stuff with RFID chips in them, the cans of soup, the RFID.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.120]  It's all Pentagon designed, all global designed. They call it smart dust. So these things read
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:42.600]  it. I have articles today where they're announcing, we're going to track you with Facebook even
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.880]  when you don't have your phone. Our face scanners are going up everywhere, you'll buy and sell
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:47.880]  with it.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.520]  This is the control grid and our own Melissa Melton wanted to talk about what she saw at
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.460]  college and again, this is old technology and they make you pay for it. And they always
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:35:00.860]  say you're going to save money. And the thing is they're high powered transmitters, folks.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:07.120]  They are blasting through your house, picking up all the other devices, activating them
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.360]  and remember what the CIA director said.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:14.520]  He said, your washing machine is watching you. That was Wired Magazine. It was a quote.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:20.360]  He got up in front of the Pentagon and said, hey, the CIA spies on everybody. Type in CIA
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:24.240]  director, your washing machine is spying on you. I want to show viewers, if you're a radio
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.280]  listener, go look that up. This is what's happening. I want to give the floor for about
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.420]  ten minutes to our guest and then we're going to have Melissa Melton comment on it with
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.000]  any of her questions, one of our reporters.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.760]  She's got a special report coming up tomorrow here on the syndicated radio broadcast. We've
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:43.600]  got three reports tomorrow. Jacari Jackson, David Knight and David Ortiz are both going
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.800]  to be in studio tomorrow with special reports live. I'm just gonna leave it at that. Now
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:55.380]  going back to the thought criminal Jennifer Stahl, imagine in her neighborhood, they'd
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.380]  gone to court.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:01.720]  They had an organization. These meters rip you off. They admit they're spying on you.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:06.340]  Without warrants, they come and put them on and then they videotape and politely say you
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.920]  don't have my authorization to do this. So they put it on YouTube and the police come
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.040]  and arrest them. I mean, just imagine she deserves life in prison or execution.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.140]  I mean, that's not enough to just arrest this woman. What does she think this is, America?
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:26.200]  This is North Korea on steroids if they have their way. It shows power drunk madness of
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:31.720]  the system. Totally disjointed out of control. So we've talked about the smart meters now.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.600]  Talk about what happened that we don't just see on the three minute tape, what your arrest
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.400]  and your accomplices arrest was like.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.140]  And now the media all being very serious. Yes, these women, I mean, just like the gentleman
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:50.240]  last year, do they deserve, I'm being sarcastic, life in prison with a straight face? Yes,
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:57.080]  yes. Life in prison. So let's talk about, do you want to confess your evil here on air?
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:03.480]  I honestly was doing only what any normal person and anybody else in Naperville or around
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.200]  this country has wanted to do, their property.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.800]  Come on, extremist, admit your evil. I cannot, I have been very civil and-
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:18.760]  Oh, that's what you all say. I'm glad you went to jail, sister, and we're gonna get
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.080]  you more in the future. You'll go to a labor camp and work for the government full time.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:28.420]  Okay, I'm gonna stop doing the absurd. This is absurd, it's Twilight Zone. I'm sorry,
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:31.920]  talk about the arrest, break it all down for us, play by play.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.080]  And then, well, first the smart meter's in the arrest, yeah.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.760]  We had filed a federal lawsuit in December of 2011, and we hoped that the city would
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:45.480]  take that very seriously and that they would reconsider. And they have said, instead dug
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.880]  their heels in and stood their ground. And so they continued to, they started to install
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:55.680]  last year and they threatened, as people were refusing, people didn't want to.
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:59.720]  And they were locking their gates and their fences, hundreds of families, if not maybe
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.680]  thousands, maybe a couple of thousand, at the very least were saying no. They told people
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:11.920]  in the papers, they said, well, we will send police escorts if people continue to refuse.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.800]  So multiple times people have refused and it finally came to a head with the last final
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.260]  nasty gram that we got in the mail, that this is your final notice and here is how this
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:27.600]  is the ordinances that state that we own the meter and we have the right to access and
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:32.920]  change the meter. So we had gotten notice from the city, and again, it was this, you
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:36.040]  know, I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:43.160]  So that fateful day of January 23rd, they were arriving and jumping people's fences.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:48.760]  Kim, who is our board president, was home when they assaulted her house. They jumped
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:56.280]  her fence. She went outside and videotaped them installing on her house, and she told
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.680]  them no and told them to stop. And they just, they cut right through her meter guard. And
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.680]  they just did that.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.280]  So, and then she proceeded. So the video that you saw earlier of the woman with the red
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:12.880]  hair and the purple shirt was in Naperville that Kim had gone to her home to film that
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:19.200]  while the police were there escorting and authorizing them to jump the fences. And so
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:26.040]  Kim videotaped that as well. We made a connection with our local CBS station who had videotaped
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:31.680]  us or had done a story on us about a year and a half ago. And they contacted, came out
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.960]  and they were doing some interviews with us and they saw the videos and they were going
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:41.600]  to make their story. And at that time, I received a call from my husband that the installers
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:48.520]  had arrived at our house. So I said, you know, tell them no and I'll be right home. And CBS,
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:53.920]  I invited CBS to follow. And so actually CBS is the one who caught everything that went
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.240]  on at my house. And Kim came along and she also videotaped it.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:03.360]  And to our understanding, and so Kim, Kim was charged with the eavesdropping. I was
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.520]  charged for blocking the meter.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:11.440]  And I wonder if the police are going to arrest CBS news for videotaping them. I mean, why
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.080]  not arrest everybody?
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:17.320]  That's the funny part of it. If you look at, if you look at our website, our homepage Naperville
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:22.280]  smart meter awareness.org, it has the, the CBS video in there. It's also in our latest
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.760]  news section. They did a five o'clock broadcast and a 10 o'clock broadcast. Both of them show
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760]  very clearly.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:31.240]  It's you see the policemen and talking to me and Kim is standing there with her little
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.620]  teeny camera and it's all being videotaped by CBS. And I was like, wait, he's having
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:39.920]  her arrested on my private property where she's been welcomed to videotape. And as far
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.640]  as we understand, that's completely legal. And so he told, he told his police officers
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.200]  to arrest. This was the Sergeant. So I was really astonished by all of that. And, and
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.680]  um, he proceeded to encourage me to, um, so I didn't see the rest of what had happened
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.400]  because I moved to my backyard where I said that I would not permit them to access the
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.400]  meter.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:06.280]  And I very calmly just said, I know I'm, I don't approve. I've informed the city. I do
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:12.620]  not permit this on my property and talk to your government owner. I talked to this police
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.120]  officer that was there and I said no. And he tried to convince me they have the right.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:22.240]  And I said, I said, no, I don't, I don't submit to the new functions that this meter does.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.840]  When I applied for electricity or, you know, signed up for electricity, I agreed to pay
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.600]  for it and I agreed for them to supply it to me. And I don't subscribe to the new functions
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.040]  that this meter provides and I'm going to keep my analog meter. So they, um, I stood
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.240]  in my backyard where I have a fence and they, I had it locked with a bike lock and he, the
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.760]  Sergeant waved the installers forward and
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:49.520]  And, and, and, and you're even polite to the God man. I mean the King, the North Korean
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:55.120]  owner of us, his property, and that is what you're charged with is obstructing the police
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.640]  just talking, saying, I verbally do not consent. And then they go over without the warrant
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.000]  and place the federal, uh, spy device on your house.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.720]  Yeah. After they caught my lock, they moved in. I, um, yeah, they, they just forced,
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.840]  So they cut your lock, break your, your property and then do this.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.760]  Yes. I went, I, and I stood in front of the meter and said, I refuse the installation
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.000]  of the smart meter on my home. And he said, step away. You're, um, you know, you're under
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.480]  arrest. And I said, for what? And he said, for, uh, interfering. And I said, interfering
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.800]  with what? And he said, interfering with an officer. So I complied because he'd said,
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:31.800]  I was under arrest.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.200]  Sure, sure. And that's why they want our guns so bad is they can really bring in the North
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.640]  Korean style. I mean, that, that is their plan. The billion six bullets, the underground
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.780]  bases, the checkpoints, they're now running checkpoints all over the country where they
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:47.020]  just search your car without a warrant. And they just go, Hey, I got a gun and a taser.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:51.240]  Get out. I'm searching. And cops, I hope you know, they're going to take the dollar. They're
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.840]  going to take your pensions. They're going to destroy America.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:59.920]  So I hope you enjoy the big power trip. Okay. Because you know, you have signed on to every
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:05.040]  tyranny of the world's ever seen. And then some, I mean, this is, this is so hardcore.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.360]  Now where is this going? The other women who were arrested don't want to come on because
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:13.040]  their lawyers have told them not to. This has been adjudicated federally and at the
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.400]  state level, literally hundreds of times, well, there's been thousands of cases of this
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.080]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:23.360]  In fact, I think it's more than a hundred times. I just read a few months ago in Illinois
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.960]  and they just keep arresting, keep arresting, keep arresting. And I mean, they will try
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:34.080]  to claim more of a case that you peacefully stood there when Supreme courts ruled state
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:39.120]  courts have ruled. The Indiana just court ruled no warrant. You peacefully stood there
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.640]  and said, no, you can't put this on my property.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.240]  They should have left and gone or presented you with an injunction, a warrant, whatever
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:53.640]  it is. No, they didn't. They didn't do that. And so it's definitely a civil rights violation.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.360]  There's a lot of ways to go after this though. You can go after them because you didn't sign
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.640]  on for this. You can go after them because it's on record that it's a boondoggle. You
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.600]  can go after them for official oppression.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.720]  What type of stuff did the police say to you once you were in the car? Because sometimes
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:16.520]  I don't know the story. That's why I'm asking. They'll apologize for being agents of tyranny.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:21.440]  But a lot of times now they're really proud of it. What happened once you got in the police
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  car?
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:28.480]  Nothing, actually. The transporting officer didn't say anything to me. And I had basically
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.960]  made small talk with the other officers that were there.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:35.360]  So they're as big a robot as the robot they're putting on your house?
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:41.560]  Quite honestly, these police, as much as people say, well, I said honestly, they were just
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:46.680]  doing what they were told to. So I really find it very clear that somebody above them
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.280]  said you're going to go ahead and do this.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.720]  Sure. But you know about Nuremberg rulings and other rulings, they are still completely
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720]  guilty.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.080]  Yeah, I know. It's hard for me to slam the police.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.880]  I know, but they're more guilty because they swore enough. They are more guilty.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.960]  Yeah, I don't know what kind of oaths they've sworn. I just wanted to keep my analog meter
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.840]  and I'm really disappointed that the city had used them to force it on me and to-
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.840]  So where's this going now? I mean, I guess they're licking their jobs trying to put you
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.840]  in jail.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.400]  Well, I mean, they took me in and they released me after a couple of hours. But I can't have
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.200]  sat around for a while. I don't know what they were doing. If they knew what they were
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.000]  arresting me for, I thought they would have given me-
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.760]  What are you planning to do with the robot now attached to your house that's spying on
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:29.760]  you?
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:37.040]  Well, I honestly can't say what I plan to do. I'm undecided.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.400]  Will they remove it? I would go dark as a protest and have candles and make a big deal
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.400]  out of it.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.640]  They won't let us people, they won't let people do that. There are people who actually told
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.960]  the city, they said, I want you to cut the power off and take that off my house. And
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:49.960]  they've told them no.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:53.940]  Yeah, you must take our, I mean, this is the new slavery. They're all dividing us around
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:57.400]  black and white and all this other garbage. While the new thing is we're going to attach
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.760]  robots that are on record ripping you off and frying you with electromagnetic radiation.
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.200]  You know, what is it? 100 times a cell phone. I saw one estimate. We're going to do this
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:11.000]  to you 24 seven. It's going to know what movie you're watching. That's NBC news. And you're
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.840]  going to sit there and you're going to take it. And I mean, this is incredible.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:20.200]  Yes, it is. It's really amazing that they continue to turn their heads to the side and
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:23.600]  say no, no, no, that's not possible because it is. It's completely possible.
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.360]  Well, you know, people are starting to cut these off and smash them. They're trying to
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.000]  persecute people. It's just going to make it a bigger issue. We have to stop these.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.740]  And again, people say, oh, it's just, it's just technology. The system is evil. They're
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:39.600]  using things that sound reasonable to enslave us. They're spying on us.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.080]  If it's just technology and it was so benign, it would have been proven a long time ago
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:46.840]  that there was really nothing wrong with these. If they were so great, they would just sell
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.840]  themselves. But when you're, when it's a fourth amendment right to privacy within my own home,
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:55.280]  I did not subscribe to you keeping track of when I'm home and when I'm not. And when you
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.040]  have a wireless system set up, who's to say that you can't just automate?
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.280]  MIT admits it's admittedly a control grid. They're not even denying it. It's like, here's
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.000]  your robot spy that hooks into all the new stuff that's being manufactured. And the CIA
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.600]  director comes out and says, we're watching you off your appliances. I mean, that's how
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.900]  arrogant and yeah, we'll kill you with drones for no reason. We're setting up checkpoints
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:18.200]  and yeah, we got machine guns.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.840]  Let me tell you, the government's gone bad. And the fact that they tried to put people
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.160]  in jail for life in Illinois for filming police, you need to understand they may be smiling
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:30.760]  and stuff. They're dangerous, okay? Cuz they'll do whatever they're told. I mean, anything
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.680]  they're told. This country is in deep trouble. And if we don't stand up and say no, it's
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:35.680]  over.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.320]  Melissa Melton, reporter, do you have any questions for Jennifer Stahl, who's had the
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.360]  courage here in the new homeland to come on our show and talk about her evil activity?
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.880]  Well, actually, I just had a story I thought she might be interested in. Whenever I first
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.640]  moved here, I think the next thing is gonna be from smart meters, there's gonna be smart
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:55.520]  thermometers. Because when I first moved here, I stayed with a bunch of college students.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.520]  And the first thing-
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:00.760]  No, no, the new thermostats only work, they dial into the smart meter.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:06.080]  Exactly. And what happens is, when I came in there, she said, this is the cool new thing.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.720]  We're in this project with UT and they put in this cool meter. And she came and showed
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:12.840]  it to me. And all you had to do was walk by it and it would turn on and it would tell
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.660]  you what the temperature was in your house today, what it was yesterday, and what it
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:19.840]  could be and how much money you could. I mean, it was all this information coming out of
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:24.000]  it. And she's like, and I can change my temperature from far away. I can go to another town and
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.860]  change it if I forget to set it. And it's like, well, yeah, but who else can change
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.860]  it as well?
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:31.540]  Yeah, these are all available right now. All that technology is available right now.
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:35.320]  And it's all a way to control. They can control it later. Later down the road, they can say,
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.380]  oh, we don't think you need this much air conditioning this summer. We'll just control
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:39.380]  that.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:42.520]  On the face, it looks like a really great idea. But then when you really think about
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.640]  the ramifications, when it's wireless, who else can get into it and can control it from
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.520]  that direction? And who's to say down the road, Department of Energy or somebody else's
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.000]  is, you know, from a federal level, we're just going to throw out the Constitution and
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.320]  we're going to start controlling power.
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:49:00.120]  No, they've already said in California, it's now going to charge you more at peak times
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.080]  or, quote, turn it off when need be. That's already been done.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.760]  Yes. And yeah, I think in Arizona, that's already taking place. Yeah, certain people
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.760]  want to watch them.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.720]  But see how your mind is designed because you're a reasonable person to go, that might
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.760]  happen someday. It's already happening.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  Exactly.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:18.080]  They are. It's incredible. Do you have any questions for Melissa?
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.680]  I was just going to say, have you read the studies that show all of these different things
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:26.040]  that health effects and different other things that happen to people that have these meters,
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.040]  headaches, heart problems, difficulty sleeping, difficulty breathing? I mean, these are on
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.040]  record.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:35.560]  They're coming all the new light bulbs. Reason they're mandated is they can do data over
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:40.920]  the power line. They're computers. And then it accesses your computer. All the school
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.080]  laptops are watching the kids at home. That's on record. I mean, we're already so deep into
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.080]  this, Melissa.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.880]  I mean, there's a reason those light bulbs have an FCC stamp on the outside of it. The
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:52.400]  Federal Communications Commission stamp on the outside of a light bulb.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.880]  Do they admit they're communicating?
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.880]  They're communicating.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.280]  It's designed to take your computer over. It's already on most of the new computers.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:03.040]  Well, a regular LED light bulb has, what, a couple hundred of this EMF coming out. Those
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.040]  new light bulbs, it's tens of thousands you're being hit with on radiation.
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.320]  Oh, listen, listen, it's not everybody I know. People have apologized to me. They put them
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.760]  in. They all get sick and they're all like, there's a black market now for the old bulbs.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.760]  Yes.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.200]  I mean, it's just, how did you wake up? How do people support you? How do they get involved?
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.560]  I think we should make a stand on this. You need to get on the offense with these creatures
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.560]  there in your town.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:32.760]  Well, our, our website is NapervilleSmartMeterAwareness.org and we do have a donation page that goes
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:35.280]  to help with our advocacy and our
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:40.800]  What about a march? I mean, against the Orwellian nightmare, you know, wake up Naperville. I
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.360]  mean, we, you need to go illustrate how crazy this is.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:50.160]  Well, honestly, Alex, we've been doing it for a couple of years and we have, uh, we've
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.920]  tried and tried to reason with these people and the council on nine people, but honestly,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.520]  only five of them could actually
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:01.400]  Stay there. I want to get your final points. We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:05.720]  Even gardeners and patriots drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive federal

[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:10.800]  In the US, one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year. Burglars call it smash
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:18.360]  and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic

[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:16.080]  If you're watching on TV, we have a Fox 29 report.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:24.840]  If you're watching on TV, we have a Fox 29 report of smart meters burning people's houses
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:30.320]  down. This is happening in Australia all over. These things just burst into flames all the
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:35.760]  time because they're an outside computer, just jam packed with spy tech. And you gotta
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.200]  love how they make them look like the old fashioned meter, and they even brag on their
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.200]  company sites.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.620]  We make them look like the old things. People don't get upset. We have surveillance pods
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:50.680]  inside fake transformers to watch them as well. Microphones and street lights will also
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:57.140]  listen to the population. The globalists see themselves as psychologists, scientists, anthropologists.
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:02.360]  They say this, studying us the animals, they the Morlock, we the Eloi. And you have to
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.920]  understand it's totally predatory.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.200]  Totally predatory at the highest level where all the tech that's rolled out and approved
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:15.120]  is designed to control you. Melissa, you were talking about the new globally putting these
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:21.540]  in, new light bulbs. Break down the numbers of how much electromagnetic radiation one
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:25.840]  of these curly cube light bulbs puts off versus the old ones.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:30.760]  I believe the incandescent light bulbs, it was in the 200s. The LED light bulbs was in
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:36.520]  the 300s, but the new CFLs, it was in the 26,000 range. It's very high.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:40.720]  Notice, yeah, so the LEDs are actually good. They're not bad, but the government's not
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:45.660]  mandating that. It's like you will take this. And it's so high powered, it's filled with
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:48.720]  mercury and gas and stuff to be able to cook you like this.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:53.840]  And there's a special instruction sheet on how to dispose of it because of all the mercury
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:56.520]  and stuff that's inside it. There's a step by step process.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.680]  The issue is they choose it all, the fluoride in the water. You've got reports about what
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:05.340]  they're putting in the food. I mean, they know. I have an article here about an eight-year-old
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.440]  gives birth in Mexico. And they're asking why the new puberty for girls is like 10,
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.960]  it used to be 14.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:14.320]  Because they're killing us, folks. They know what they're doing. I have the White House
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:20.120]  Science Czar's own book, Ecoscience. I have Paul Ehrlich's books, all top government advisors.
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:25.800]  They're eugenicist. So they have decoys, things that look harmless, cell phones, all of it
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:31.600]  surveilling you, tracking you, poisoning you, the body scanners at the airport, all of it.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.520]  And this sounds so wild, but it's real. Let's go to Jennifer Stahl here finishing up. Any
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:41.800]  other points you'd like to make about this, ma'am?
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.900]  What's happening here in Naperville is because, like I was saying, it's a little island. We
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:53.220]  are actually a case study. It's on the government, the whitehouse.gov. They submitted a document
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:57.360]  back when they put out American Recovery and Reinvestment Act about how the smart grid
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:02.060]  of the 21st century in Naperville is listed in it as a case study.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:08.440]  So we honestly are being studied. It would be a perfect smart grid if they actually did
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:13.560]  get 100% of compliance, which is what the city manager is saying right now in the newspapers.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:19.360]  You're an example of crushing people to see if they can get it done. That's why I'm saying
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:21.960]  you're so important. We've got to fight here.
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:28.040]  Right. And we've worked to get a referendum, a non-binding advisory referendum on the ballot,
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:34.000]  and the city actually got involved and worked to object it. And the city electoral board,
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.760]  which of course is made up of the city attorney and the city manager, the city clerk, and
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:46.860]  the mayor, and the senior most council member, they said that we didn't have ballot signatures,
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:47.860]  so they got it.
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:50.720]  Well, it's time to start getting aggressive with these people. You've got all sorts of
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:54.640]  lawsuits. Lawyers need to contact you. They're on your website and take action against these
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.500]  people. What about your friend who videotaped the news right beside her? They're allowed
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:03.200]  to videotape on the sidewalk. She's been arrested. And I guess that's going forward jail time
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:05.000]  now for videotaping on the sidewalk.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.280]  I mean, how dare you not want a giant robot that burst into flames attached to the side
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.280]  of your house?
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.520]  Right. All she was doing was videotaping what was happening. She was videotaping the police
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.600]  officer doing, quote unquote, his job of what he was told to do. And I don't understand
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:19.600]  how that's unlawful.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:22.760]  Well, videotaping isn't allowed in North Korea either, hon.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.760]  Yeah, I suppose.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.320]  Well, you're a wonderful lady and have a lot of courage. And just God bless you. And people
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.480]  are going to be contacting you. Folks are going to want to come from all over. You should
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.280]  have a date a month from now for a big demonstration, and I'll get behind it. We'll talk to you
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.280]  again soon. Thank you so much.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.280]  Thanks for having me.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.280]  God bless you. An amazing lady.

[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:56.200]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:01.900]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:07.060]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:27.160]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. The Global Technocratic
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:39.880]  Psycho Science Guild has broken down a global grid, an exactly contoured and programmed
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:48.040]  plan to roll out an electric spy grid, a total grid. We may have a mic open or headphones
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:54.240]  or something on in here. Something's going on over here. They've got a total plan to
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:01:00.840]  bring in this program. And MIT brags, the globalist all brags, they just said we're
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.100]  gonna put the grid in, incrementally turn off the resources, make people get sterilized
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:09.760]  to get food, produced by giant robot factories, and then we'll just go ahead and release bioweapons
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:10.920]  on everybody else and kill them.
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:16.760]  And we're gonna phase out to about 1% of the population. They tell regular students before
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.280]  their master's degree or their PhD that they're only gonna get rid of 80%. And then once you
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.480]  get higher up, they go, no, we're gonna kill 90%. And on the higher level of white papers,
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:33.560]  they go, we're gonna kill more than 99%. And you're only letting, I mean, even Dr. Bianca,
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:37.840]  you know, UT says, well, I'll have to die in my family, but it's for the cause. And
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.960]  the Texas Academy of Sciences stood and cried.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.600]  Yes, I mean, they're gonna die. We're gonna die so David Rockefeller gets everything.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:52.280]  He gave us our PhDs, he's gone. David Rockefeller, I love you, David Rockefeller. I'm supposed
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.960]  to just roll over and go, well, you're putting spy robots on my house and spying on me in
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:00.760]  streetlights with microphones and you're dialing into my computer watching me and everything's
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:01.760]  controlled.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.000]  Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the cancer viruses and the vaccines. Thank you
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.200]  so much for everything. Gee, gee, thanks for the GMO that sterilizes all the ratcheted
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.760]  too. Hey, gee, thanks for all the increased cancer rates and death happening. Man, I really
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:18.440]  appreciate the government and all the troops too, yeah, I support them.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:22.320]  That's why we should let them use DU and have their pension funds stolen. I mean, it's all
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:28.920]  just fake and it's all just a giant fraud. Humans are seen by the globalist as animals.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:33.220]  They've created an artificial environment, artificial culture, artificial media, artificial
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:39.000]  twisted info by degrees until they phased it into just la la land now. And the general
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.280]  public is losing connection to reality and just drones are gonna kill me in the smart
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.320]  meter watch is what I do.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.200]  That's freedom. You don't like it, you're a terrorist. So I'm gonna give the phone number
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:55.280]  out and take your phone calls when we come back and run through a bunch of important
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:06.080]  news. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231, first time callers, first time
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.320]  callers, first time callers.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:14.360]  Let's let other people get on the show, please. 800-259-9231. And I mean, so when you're awake
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:18.480]  to this stuff, it is literal cuckoo land. And then it's not like you're crazy. You go
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:21.760]  read the books by the globalist. Got a bookshelf right over there, I'll show it to you, showing
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.760]  you the articles. We got a bunch of articles with globalist, one child policy worldwide,
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.360]  sterilize everybody, cut the energy off for the Earth, take over, get rid of the family.
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.640]  I mean, there's like seven or eight articles a day on infoawards.com where they're just
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.560]  telling us what they're gonna do to us. It's not like I'm just sitting here giving you
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.600]  my objective look at this, it's not even about being objective.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:50.720]  It's beyond that, it's prima facie, in your face, admitted, trumpeted in thousands of
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.480]  publications, their plan, their religion. And they get the Texas Academy of Sciences
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.880]  up there and 90 plus percent of them standing ovation when Dr. Bianca projects red skulls
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:06.000]  on the wall and says, soon airborne Ebola will be released and 90% of us will die.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.040]  And I know me and my family are gonna die, but it's for the Earth and I'm elating it.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:16.240]  And it's just such a moment of darkness and such a power trip to imagine 6.5 billion dead
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:23.320]  people that they just all start crying. It is so luscious, it is so good, it is so powerful.
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:29.200]  I'm a nerdly person with a pocket protector. And something in me gets excited when I talk
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:37.520]  about killing people in mass, it's so good. It's because you are absolutely selected because
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.000]  you are a twit.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.960]  You are a control freak, you are a nobody, you are a failure, you are a joke, you are
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:50.240]  anti-human, you are a cog, you love and worship the power. You're a wannabe technocrat, you're
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:54.600]  a joke, you're filthy. The globalists are probably gonna destroy the Earth, they're
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:58.920]  the ones doing all the GMO, but you're not worried about that. Just kill the humans,
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.000]  carbon dioxide's evil.

[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:32.040]  That's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm we're
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:39.720]  here live ladies and gentlemen. And I have a ton of news that we've not gotten to so
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:46.320]  far. It is all well part of the insanity of our world. Let me just recap a few of the
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:53.320]  top stories here. Polish dismay over CIA torture papers that their country's been used as a
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:59.720]  torture base. I mean it came out six years ago they had torture camps in Poland. And
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:04.600]  of course it's continuing under Obama. And then five years from now they'll have more
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:09.240]  reports of, we didn't know that. I mean it's just a standard response to a public they
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:13.520]  know is in a coma. Financial Times of London. I mean Obama said he stopped the torturing
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:17.960]  it turns out they've expanded and of course it's all lies. But he is a Democrat so it
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:23.680]  must be okay. Continuing judge jury and execution are legal experts for implications of White
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:27.120]  House drone memo saying you don't even need to be a terrorist.
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:31.200]  See folks it's the same thing. They just say you're a terrorist. No judge, no jury and
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:34.720]  kill you. You're a US citizen. They're even saying they'll kill you here. Israel said
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:39.560]  and Reuters like seven, eight years ago they said we'll kill US citizens in America if
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:44.480]  we think they're connected to terrorists in America. Well absolutely watch what hospitality
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.920]  is for come and kill our citizens.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.820]  I mean that's what this has become and now they're just saying yeah we'll kill whoever
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:56.200]  we want. You don't have to be a terrorist or even be connected to it really we'll just
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:01.520]  kill you. It's the same thing. Exclusive again just part of the memo reveals legal case for
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:09.440]  drone strikes on Americans. And it goes on that Homeland Security is not doing 90% of
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:12.960]  the Freedom of Information Act request. No, it's totally illegal they're doing it. So
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:13.960]  what?
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:16.920]  Their secret, the smart meter. Hey, I wonder if you could put a smart meter on the NSA
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:22.000]  and listen to what they're doing. No, you'll be going to jail for the rest of your life.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.260]  But we're gonna watch and listen to you Mac. And if you don't like it, we're not gonna
[02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:31.040]  take it off your house. They're even coming into areas that are rural areas and saying
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.440]  we're putting one on your house.
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:36.360]  And if you don't like it, the SWAT team is gonna come here and you're like, well, where's
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:41.560]  your warrant? Where's your order? We don't need that. They have MP5 submachine guns.
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:46.720]  They're down the street in armored vehicle right now old man. Right now old man. We don't
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.880]  need nothing anymore. We have the firearms. Do you understand? We're looking to crush
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:58.600]  you people. They're gonna take everything. I hope everyone enjoys their evil.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:04.620]  Cuz the babies getting aborted aren't humans either. And I guess 13 month old child run
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:11.360]  over by the eugenics police in China. And our media is like, well, I mean, it's probably
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:19.040]  an accident. No, isn't it nice to have a helpful media? They'd like to be able to do stuff
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.080]  like that here. And don't worry, they will.
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:27.440]  If we let them, and I'm sure we will. Cuz it's normal to have the government doing everything
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:33.280]  it's doing. Warless checkpoints everywhere now. It's for safety. The drug war's for safety.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.840]  It's all for safety now.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:40.280]  Congress considers putting limits on drone strikes. Yeah, yeah, we'll deal with that
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.880]  insider trading and then they push it through.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:50.280]  Carney, drone strikes legal. Ethical lies. Well, if Carney said that, I mean, after all.
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:54.840]  And no discussion about Anwar al-Awlaki is admittedly CIA and trade at the Pentagon.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:59.960]  It's mainstream news, but just ignore that. Let's continue. City in Virginia becomes first
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:03.760]  to pass anti-drone legislation. Things going in the right direction there, some good news
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:04.760]  there.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:09.640]  Then we have, of course, the last hour's guest, the imagine filming the police next to a CBS
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:16.000]  news crew. The CBS news crew, of course, was not arrested for filming. Only a scum citizen
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:25.720]  was. And after all, that's the way to go. After all, that's the way to handle the whole
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:27.120]  thing.
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:38.000]  Isn't that just special? Absolutely, totally, and completely special. Special in every way.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.580]  Let's go to the gun stacks. I'm gonna go to the police state stack and then to your phone
[02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:51.640]  calls at 800-259-9231. Let's look at this article right here. California law would force
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:55.780]  gun owners to buy insurance and the legislature can say whatever cost it is.
[02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:58.960]  And they have legislators admitting, yeah, you can build a coal plant, we're just gonna
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:07.160]  bankrupt it. And they say, you can get a gun if you can pay $10,000 a year insurance. Power
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:12.000]  to tax is the power to destroy, like Obamacare set to double premiums this year and set to
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.520]  quadruple them in the next five to six years.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:21.000]  Hey, how's that gonna bankrupt you? And that's the plan. And you know what? The IRS isn't
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.400]  gonna come take your house, your car, and everything else. And then if you don't pay
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:31.960]  that, we're gonna put you in jail. That sounds like some freedom, huh? On the poorest people?
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:38.160]  Letting your hours cut to 25 hours written by the corporations? A new payroll tax? Has
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:42.960]  the economy shrinking? The food stamp rolls just exploded?
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.920]  Man, you're gonna get some help from the governor, aren't you? Cuz let me tell you, Obama's real
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:51.920]  nice with those 100 plus torture camps where they're killing kids in front of their parents
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:57.040]  and stuff. I mean, these are real nice people. They're real nice. And they're buying the
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.680]  bunkers and the bullets and the tanks and training to kill you and your family cuz they're
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:02.800]  good people.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:11.160]  Good people, good people. That's right. They say, hey, it's for the Earth. We're getting
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:21.920]  rid of your jobs. Yeah, they're gonna ruin loves us. And all of you that serve the system
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:31.000]  think you're on the winning team. You're on the winning team, all right. Yeah, you just
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:38.720]  opened the door for something real nice, real nice.
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:47.840]  Hope you enjoy it. Hope you like it. Here's New World Order. All right, there's that first
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:53.760]  article. That doesn't get you happy. This one's even better. You want more? Hey, Washington
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:59.800]  Examiner, Alexandria cops bust 10-year-old for bringing toy gun to school.
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:04.040]  And they're charging them for the water gun for the toy gun. That's even more evil than
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:10.000]  a bubble gun. It's even got a longer range. My goodness, we got 100 shots in one. I mean,
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.080]  and they're charging him for brandishing a weapon. He didn't even threat anybody with
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:14.080]  a toy gun.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.240]  You could actually with a toy gun that looks real, if you threaten somebody and demanded
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:21.000]  something, that actually would be. But no, he just said, look, I got my little water
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.760]  gun. You wanna play after school? My gosh, I remember going to public school when I was
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.960]  in first grade and they had the school fair and everybody got little free cap guns.
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:34.760]  Well, if you like dunked a lady or whatever, got the apple or you got a little toy gun.
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:39.680]  But not now, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When my dad was a kid, he took his shotgun
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:45.680]  to school to go hunting with people. But no, no, no, no. Now, little 10-year-old Billy,
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.260]  well his life's over. He's gonna be in the criminal system and they say they're going
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:54.120]  forward with the prosecution. Criminal prosecution and keep America safe while the government
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:56.000]  ships in the narcotics.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.400]  The boy, a fifth grader at Douglas MacArthur, imagine what Douglas MacArthur would think
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:07.760]  of that. Elementary school, whose name is not being released, was charged as a juvenile
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.480]  with brandishing a weapon, police said. He was also suspended from school and Alexander
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:17.880]  City Police Superintendent Morton Sherman said further action is being considered, excluding
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:18.880]  expulsion.
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.600]  On Monday, the boy showed the plastic gun to at least one other student during a bus
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:30.280]  ride home and from the school. The 10-year-old did not point at anyone or threatened to shoot
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:36.560]  it. But he neglected to mention that the weapon was a fake, said Alexandria Police spokeswoman
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:37.960]  Ashley Hinderbrandt.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:44.000]  He didn't threaten to shoot anybody, but he neglected, well, the 10-year-old didn't know
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.080]  the subtlety. She got the prosecutors going, how do we get this hardened criminal? Well,
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:52.120]  we could twist the statue this way and then maybe the jury won't know it's a violation
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:56.640]  of law. And then we could violate his civil rights and get another one in the system.
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.080]  We get federal money for that. You know, you can't just get the money by putting them all
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:05.300]  on Prozac and Ritalin and screwing them all up that way. We got to get them in the prisons.
[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:08.240]  After all, they've got agreements with the big prison companies to fill those things
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:14.320]  at 90%. So they've got the prison industries running security in the schools. Yes, tootling
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:21.920]  them. The tootlage, now you don't get a, what's the name of it when someone, a tutor, yes,
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:22.920]  yes.
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:27.640]  You don't now get tootlage to go to college or become an engineer. You have prison guard
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:34.800]  tootlers preparing you for the new America, where every house gets a smart meter. Sort
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:40.800]  of a chicken in every pot, a smart meter and a microwave oven frying you in your body.
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:44.880]  Another loving article. Here's another one. Court, New York Times request for New York
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:51.240]  City gun owners violates law. Yeah, of course it's illegal when newspapers for decades publish
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.800]  concealed carry owners' homes and people get robbed and harassed. But they don't care,
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.120]  no one will enforce that.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:00.480]  So what if it's illegal? Of course it's illegal putting a smart meter on your house to rip
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:05.080]  you off and spy on you. But so what? So we're drones killing people with no prior proof
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:11.720]  of cause. So what? Let's continue. Video, Newtown father blast gun control. Video is
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:14.440]  powerful. I meant to play it, we have time, we will.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:18.240]  You will take my ability to protect my Victoria from my cold dead hands. Well, obviously an
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:22.480]  extremist. I mean, he's probably the type that would film police on the sidewalk. Can
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:28.640]  you imagine these Americans think on their sidewalk they can film police putting a smart
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:30.400]  meter on their house in Illinois?
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:36.240]  Thank God all these housewives got arrested immediately or came from work and whatever.
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.000]  I mean, my goodness. Bruce Willis, who I know is a listener, but we've never really worked
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.920]  too hard to get him on. But folks, get the word to Bruce. I guess I could call Rick Linkletter,
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.160]  who told me he was a listener and I confirmed it. I need to get him on the show. Bruce Willis,
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:50.560]  don't infringe on my Second Amendment.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:54.560]  He goes on to just say it's all a big power grab. Okay, there you got that. Postal service
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:19:00.360]  to cut Saturday mail. Yes, the implosion continues. You don't need that mail anymore, prisoner.
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:06.840]  Prison officer busted after becoming pregnant by cop killer she was guarding. Well, I mean,
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:11.520]  you can't keep two peas in a pot away from each other, can you? Everybody knows the prisons
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:12.960]  are the biggest party in the world.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:17.080]  I mean, they're selling sex, blood, that's what they sell to get the drugs and the drugs
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.460]  come out. A lot of big prisons, including the youth prisons, they run prostitution rackets
[02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:24.360]  with the kids. That's how they make their money to get their drugs. That's the older
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:28.600]  ones, the little ones, the kids that are just kept there, the 10-year-olds and stuff when
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:30.400]  the judges and people show up.
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:35.800]  Yeah, it's a big party. I mean, come on, man. The government cares about you, though. They're
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:42.920]  good people. A policewoman demoted over sexual explicit video and photos. Well, yeah, she'll
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:47.720]  probably go to prison here. This is just a woman with regular normal stuff. That should
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:48.720]  be illegal.
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:54.560]  Now, they want to kill kids in a torture camp. That's pretty good. That's pretty American.
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:58.320]  Children allegedly engage in sex acts with each other at Carson Preschool. So now if
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:01.240]  the kids, they're gonna try to put them in jail now.

[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:28.080]  All right, look, I got a bunch of other news. That was one stack I was going through that
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.940]  just is so absurd and so over the top, I don't even know what to say anymore. It's the level
[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:37.360]  of tyranny piling and piling and piling and the whole government structure all hyped up
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:44.440]  in a bizarre frenzy, an orgy of violating us and running over us and stealing from us
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:51.600]  and hen pecking us. He sent forth hordes of agents to eat out our substance. That's what
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.440]  is in the Declaration of Independence. And it makes me physically ill.
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:25:02.800]  It makes me physically ill because I haven't even gotten in to half of this stack and just
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:07.200]  listen to what's in these stacks. I'll just try to read the headlines. One child policy
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:12.560]  enforcer crushes baby to death after parents refused to pay fine. This is how NBC News
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:18.360]  ran it. Baby crush by car containing China one child policy team. How do you spin it?
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:22.920]  Where we'll just run over the baby here with the parents being held by the other enforcers
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:32.480]  and then, baby crushed. I guess that'd be like man on death. Man at prison sat down
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:36.440]  in chair accidentally and had electricity go through head in an electric chair.
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:45.600]  I mean, it's like, my goodness, I mean, this is just crazy. All dogs would now be microchipped,
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  government says, in England. That's getting humans ready for it. Nowhere to hide. Do Facebook
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:58.480]  app to track offline users. Second graders suspended for trying to save the world. Yep.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:02.960]  Germany games to destroy CCTV cameras. That's a government setup to try to get youth to
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:07.000]  go out and do stuff. Mexican girl gets pregnant just as eight year olds.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.780]  And then we've got all the breakdowns of the plastic additives and stuff designed to make
[02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:14.680]  women hyper feminine and men feminine. That's why men are so feminine now. UK government
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:19.760]  plans to track all web users, MI5 to install black box spy devices to monitor British Internet
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:20.760]  traffic.
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:23.920]  That's been in since the Internet started. It's all on record. They're just telling the
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:30.240]  slaves about it now. Where evil lurks, neurologist discovers dark passion inside the human brain
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.240]  of killers and so they'll just have to cut that out of us now and we won't resist them.
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:39.600]  Meet Rex, the $1 million bionic man with a working heart, set of lungs and human face.
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:44.440]  That'll be your new smart meter they attach to your house. Hi, I'm Max, I'm watching you.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.240]  This is freedom. This is not 1984. If you say it is, you'll be permanently detained.
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:55.200]  If you videotape me, you'll be arrested. But I'm gonna watch you. Hi, I'm Max.
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:02.300]  Americans spend up to 80% of time cyber loafing, yeah. Not around here they don't. And that's
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:06.840]  just that stack. Let's just start going to some calls right now. I got more coming up.
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:10.640]  Let's talk to John in Texas. He wants to talk about a toy gun. I just said the word gun.
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:15.100]  If you say toy gun in school, you get arrested. So you're like, well, that's crazy. Not the
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:20.200]  next generation. They're brainwashing them now. Go ahead, John. Saying the word that
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:24.360]  should have you arrested, toy gun, go ahead.
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.720]  I'm 63. I went to school, the elementary school in the 1950s. And everybody took toy guns
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:33.660]  to school back then and played with them on a playground. We had, everybody took jack
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:38.160]  knives to school. And we had show and tell- We all brought our pocket knives and showed
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:42.240]  them off. And that was for me just 25 years ago. I know, I know.
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.640]  We had show and tell. My dad had a Japanese flag and bayonet. He got in the Pacific. And
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:50.880]  I took it to school for show and tell. My buddy's dad had a brother.
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.840]  Let me stop you. Did you just say dad? That's another word. You can't say gun or dad. Now
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:59.560]  next time you're going to jail. Okay. Now they're already arresting people for stuff
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:04.960]  like that. So watch it. Watch it, racist. Watch it, racist. Watch it, sexist.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.880]  My buddy. Don't say buddy. That means friendship. They're not allowed to shake hands in most
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:14.080]  public schools. First dodge ball, now no running, now no shaking hands. Don't say dad. Don't
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:18.600]  say buddy. Don't say gun. Don't say bayonet. Well, my friend's dad had a brother.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:23.520]  No, you don't say dad here. And you don't say bayonet. Man, this guy's an extremist.
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:26.240]  You think I'm joking? In England, you get arrested for this. Go ahead.
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:29.800]  He went in and he asked the teacher if he could bring the pistol in to show it for show
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:33.840]  and tell. The teacher said, yeah. His dad took the magazine out of it, give it to him.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:38.280]  He brought it into school. Oh, extremism, extremism.
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:42.520]  Put the gun in his desk. Show and tell time came. He stood up in front of the class and
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:47.160]  said, here's, told how his dad caught that, captured that pistol during the Italian campaign.
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.600]  Show and tell is not allowed because it allows the child to direct the teaching. Department
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:56.000]  of education wants it gone. You're only allowed to show and tell out of a booklet where you
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.760]  can select what they want you to look at. You can't have children with original thought,
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.160]  thinking about what they want to bring all week, excited about getting up and speaking
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:04.160]  to people.
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:09.680]  Mike, we could have individuals if that happened. You need to be on Ritalin Prozac now. There
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:15.280]  it is. France proposes banning words, mother and father from government documents in schools.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:21.020]  There you go. It's also in the schools. See, I told you, you filth.
[02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:27.320]  At the end of the day, the teacher gave the gun back to my dad, my friend. And he said,
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.040]  here, here, here, take this back to your dad.
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:34.600]  Oh my, the extremism. I'm sorry. Get him off the air. Can't wait till the government totally
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:39.040]  takes over and arrest all these people. I mean, the government's going to have guns.
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:46.360]  The government, when the commissars have guns and the people have them, red power, our guns
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:50.280]  are good. Yours are bad. I control the words. I'm a liberal.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:30:03.200]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:07.280]  for truth seekers. We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on
[02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:12.480]  the online video bookstore at info wars.com. And out of all the titles we've carried, one
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:18.040]  stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing. And that's Dreams from My Real
[02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:24.280]  Father by Joel Gilbert, available at info wars.com. This film exposes the fraud that
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:29.040]  Obama is like nothing I've seen. If you wanna know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the

[02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:02.720]  and a lot more are all available at info warshop.com.
[02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:09.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:16.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's important to pray for this broadcast. I'm trying everything
[02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:23.720]  I can to illustrate the absurdity, okay? I'm trying everything I can to get you thinking
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:45.440]  here. I was just showing a video clip. We're gonna cue up and play a little bit later after
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:48.240]  I take some more calls of Chris Rock in a speech today.
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:53.400]  I saw him on CNN during a break up there animatedly telling us we should all turn our guns in
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:58.120]  except for the government. And he's like, look, Obama is now our daddy. And see, that's
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:01.440]  what I used to say about Bush. Conservatives would let him do anything that was not conservative
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:06.420]  or not constitutional because he was our daddy.
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:15.720]  He was our daddy, and they associated their power with him. They associated their identity
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:20.120]  with him. And now with Obama, I mean, it's just, hey, I like it to be tortured or secretly
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:24.240]  arrest. Hey, I like him, so that means I'm a winner. I like him if he raises my taxes,
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:25.240]  I'm a winner.
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:28.360]  I like it to be lies to me, I'm a winner, cuz it doesn't matter. And that's why we're
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:35.080]  going poor, that's why our society is falling apart. It's because we have gotten to this
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:40.520]  point. I've got all these clips I wanna play. We've got just a ton of them. We've got Melissa
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:44.760]  Melton's Super Bowl Illuminati special report that we can put together.
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:51.080]  We've got just a whole pass. Guys, can I have, will you get a chance, the latest video sheet,
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:57.600]  audio clip sheet? Or is this the latest? Cuz I don't see someone there that I know we have.
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:03.020]  It is important to support this broadcast because you know I'm going 110% here and so
[02:35:03.020 --> 02:35:07.780]  is my crew.
[02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:12.140]  And we are trying our very, very best to get all this information out. We have the video
[02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:18.680]  up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, an article by Steve Watson, where Chris Rock
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:26.960]  says that he is our daddy. And so we're going to, again, as I said, play that coming up
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:27.960]  for you.
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:31.640]  And I've got about ten other stacks of news here that I also wanna go over a little bit.
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:37.920]  But just remember that when you buy books, t-shirts, materials, information, that you
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.440]  support the broadcast. Things like Propure Water Filtration with the promo code WATER
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:43.520]  you get 10% off.
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:48.580]  Things like Strategic Relocation, the film and the book, it's excellent info to have.
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:52.600]  Things like the New Obama Joker shirt that has the come and take it on the back. Now
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:59.720]  the best seller ever, just out three or four days. All of these are very, very important
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:05.860]  and it supports us. Now when you get the magazine at cost in groups of 10, 20, 30, up to 100,
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:06.960]  that does not support us.
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:10.480]  That is something to get the word out to people. I mean, all of it supports us one way or the
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:14.640]  other cuz we're all in this together. And the magazine almost always sells out. We've
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.960]  had one issue of what, seven or the seventh issue or the sixth issue that didn't completely
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:19.960]  sell out.
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:25.840]  We have a few copies left of. But it's why the tyrants want your guns. And we've only
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:30.400]  got about 10,000 of those left. More than 20,000 of those have sold at cost in groups
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  of 10 up to 100. And you can get those at infowarsstore.com. And it's a big color formatted
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:44.400]  glossy magazine.
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.260]  The first issue was newsprint and it's got a big poster. It's got the poster in the middle
[02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:52.280]  of the AK-47 saying the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed with the
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.040]  words inside the gun and the come and take it. That is great to hang up at work or the
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:01.720]  office or to put in legal and lawful areas in public commons where people hang up posters.
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:06.180]  Look at that baby. I love how this Texas symbol of come and take it is becoming more popular
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:07.720]  than even the Gadsden flag.
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:14.720]  So that's at infowarsstore.com. All of it, infowarsstore.com, infowarshop.com. Both URLs
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:20.740]  get you to the Infowarsstore. And you can also call 888-253-3139 for any of the books
[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:28.120]  or films or materials, 888-253-3139. And every order, no matter how small, gets Citizen Rule
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:32.440]  Book in it and a little pamphlet. We have a caller about Citizen Rule Book, I see. They're
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:33.440]  on the screen.
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:37.000]  We don't screen your calls. People volunteer what they're calling in about. Sometimes they
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:42.520]  put it on screen. And we throw bumper stickers in there. And we also throw a little catalog
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:46.360]  in there of not all of our stuff. There's so much stuff on the site. But again, that's
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:49.160]  how we're doing it is your help. And believe me, there's a lot of behind the scenes crud
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.600]  going on to try to stop us. So just mid-air refueling. Support us, spread the word about
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:57.520]  us and support our local affiliates as well.
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:02.880]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Illinois. Wants to talk about smart meters. What'd you
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:08.200]  think of that interview last hour? Have you heard it where the woman filming the police
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:13.480]  next to CBS on the sidewalk as they went across people's property without warrants and put
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:16.880]  smart meters on, they arrest her but leave CBS alone.
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.080]  Telling CBS has got lawyers. I mean, that is cold blooded.
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:28.480]  Alex, it absolutely blew my mind. I actually live not too far from Naperville. One thing
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.120]  that I wanted to get out to all the info warriors out there and I wanted to point out to you.
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:38.500]  Today was Governor Pat Quinn's state of the state address here in Illinois. I was live
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:44.880]  streaming him as you were talking to her. And literally, as I'm listening to both, Governor
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:51.760]  Pat Quinn calls for the legislation here in Illinois to pass legislation for taxpayers
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:57.600]  to invest into more green energy, to get more of these smart meters into our communities.
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:03.840]  More and more of our communities here in Illinois are buying into ComEd's programs of the city
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:10.560]  taking over the electrical inputs to the customers. It's sickening. It made me sick to my stomach
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:11.560]  and-
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:15.360]  It takes control of all the devices in your house because all the big Fortune 500 tech
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.520]  companies, only about 15 of them, they all get in meetings that are public. In fact,
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:23.400]  one of the meetings was in Chicago about 12 years ago where they talked about the smart
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:28.360]  dust and the control and all the hookups and the smart meters. It's total enslavement.
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:34.880]  Exactly, Alex. And then not five minutes after he went into his green energy rhetoric and
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:42.440]  was drumming up the bonds for that, he went into an assault weapons ban assault. It's
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:47.560]  going to be the same as New York and Maryland, and now they're doing it here. And of course,
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.080]  all the Chicago political machine, all the big names, they all stood up and applauded
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:57.020]  that. So I just want to get the word out to all the info warriors that are all around
[02:39:57.020 --> 02:40:03.040]  the world. It's starting to sweep. It's starting to move all across this nation. We need to
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:04.040]  wake up.
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:09.360]  There's a scientific takeover program where they admit, yeah, we spy on you. We control
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:13.880]  what you do. We know what movie you're watching. Now sit down and shut up. We got our men waiting.
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:17.600]  I mean, it's like you're all under arrest. You're the ones that need to go to jail. But
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:26.260]  see, the tyrants, they now are moving against us at light laser speed. At light laser speed.
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:31.080]  At light laser speed. I mean, they are gang rushing. They've got all their people hyped
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:35.280]  up. They've hired the control freaks. They're lined up and they're coming. I mean, it is
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:39.720]  on drums, drums, drums in the deep. They are coming. God bless you. Thanks for the goal.
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:45.600]  Duke in Oklahoma. You're on the air listing on one oh two point three FM. Yes. Welcome.
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:52.040]  Welcome. I'd like to make a comment about something that y'all your listeners may have
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:57.000]  not heard about. Wasn't when he demur out of Grand County, Colorado. He was a business
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:03.680]  owner, had a muffler shop. And the man who owned the property surrounded him had paid
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:10.080]  off the city council with free concrete from his business part concrete to close the road
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:14.920]  and detect the city council to close the road and shut his business off. Well, when there's
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:19.720]  a guy that welded himself into a D nine dozer and went through town and took out the city
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:27.520]  council members business properties. I remember that. I remember that. Yeah. Well, he had
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:34.360]  a petition signed a year prior to this incident where mainly most of the people of Grand County
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:38.880]  signed it stating that they wanted to keep that road open for his business. Well, that's
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:45.000]  just another example of what what's going on right in front of people's eyes. A regular
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.120]  person thinks you make money about working hard, inventing something, writing something,
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:53.400]  making music, you know, cooking good food, however you make your money.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:57.520]  They make money by shutting your business off and and setting up theirs. They make their
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:01.440]  money by shutting down the power plant and theirs makes double money. They make money
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:05.960]  by making you buy their smart meter, making you buy their Obamacare. I mean, it's just
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:11.120]  total mafia government. How are we going to get control of it? Man, I tell you, they're
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.200]  buying billions of bullets, armored vehicles, the troops that they're trying to get robot
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:19.280]  drones and robot ground forces and Al Sharpton and all the globalists say, hey, forget your
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:20.280]  guns.
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:23.280]  We got drones. That's what they're saying that they're mafia. They're going, we'll kill
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.520]  you. We got drones. We'll arrest you. And they're like, because they're actually scared.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:30.400]  They couldn't hold Baghdad. They couldn't hold anything. I'm not bashing the troops
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:33.800]  for not being able to do that. It was an evil war. They're not gonna be able to hold this
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:35.320]  unless they hold our minds.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:38.720]  So they're busy going, we'll kill you. We got drones. We'll take it. Yeah, you know
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.160]  what? It's true. We will torture you. You know what? It is in the Army report. We tortured
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.320]  little kids in front of their parents. And most people go, man, I'm scared. Okay, take
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:46.320]  whatever I got.
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:50.160]  Well, the answer is not to roll over to these people. The answer is for the military and
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:58.280]  police and everybody to go, my God, and get on our knees and repent. I mean, here's the
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:03.600]  deal. Evil has already stolen the wealth of America and gotten very powerful off our wealth.
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:07.640]  Now it's trying to fully convert the takeover and keep the ill gotten gains.
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:13.520]  We've got to get the word out and resist this. We've absolutely got to do that and just resist
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:19.960]  them at every level and realize how bad they are. If people knew how evil the system is
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:24.080]  and how it's taken over everywhere right now, if people knew what I knew or what you knew
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:28.560]  or people who experienced this knew, they'd know how desperate it is.
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:34.840]  How desperate this is. And I mean, that's really it. We've got to get desperate because
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:39.000]  they want to keep the food, the entertainment flowing like opium. It's like they're chopping
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.920]  our legs off one piece at a time, but they're pumping us full of painkillers. We've got
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:48.080]  to get off the TV, get off all the devil stuff, get off all the distractions, and really wake
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:50.560]  up and go, man, these people are chewing on our toes.
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.040]  They've already chewed our toes off. We can make it without our toes, but not without
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:58.920]  our feet. We got to kick them off and then they're going to hiss and have blood dripping
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:01.680]  out of their mouth and go, I was just helping you. And you're like, no, you're not. They're
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:06.360]  like, yes, lay back down. Lay back down. Here, take more. Let the TSA grope your wife. I
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:07.360]  mean, they're demons.
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:14.080]  But you got to realize they're a little vampiric. It's for your good. Checkpoints on the highway.
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:17.640]  Telling your kids to spy on you. And you're like, no, history says that's bad. Bill of
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.560]  Rights says that's bad. My gut tells me you're bad. No, I'm not bad. I'm your friend. I mean,
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:28.480]  you've got to realize what they are. They're demons. They've got a bunch of good old boys.
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:33.200]  Ah procedure. I do whatever they tell me. Well, you know what? You're going to pay the
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:38.080]  price for that. God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call. John in Washington. You're on the
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:45.680]  air. Welcome. Come on down, John. You want to talk about citizen rule books. You're a
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:48.280]  prison planet, prison planet.tv viewer. Go ahead.
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:55.300]  Hey, how you doing, Alex? Yeah, I recently got a come and take a t-shirt. I was able
[02:44:55.300 --> 02:45:02.320]  to afford it. That's not good. Turn your guns into government. They want to help you. Yeah.
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:07.160]  People from over the border are taking their jobs anyway. Uh, I got a citizen's hand rule
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:12.040]  book, citizen's rule book in there when we got it, when I got it. And that has been more
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:17.680]  help to me than anything. And I would like to get them into the hands of people, but
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:23.520]  because I'm not working, I can't afford to buy a stack of them. And I was wondering if
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:26.280]  there's a way that you can give me a stack of them.
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:31.840]  So here's the deal. I already sell the citizen rule books at cost. I mean, I sell them and
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:36.120]  I put them in things free. And sometimes I thought about canceling because it's gotten
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:44.320]  so expensive. The magazines put out at cost. And you know, it's, it's, it's been interesting.
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:47.320]  It's turned out really good, but it's also been a nightmare at some levels because I
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:50.560]  got all these other projects I need to launch.
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:56.400]  But I mean, I, you understand that if I start giving citizen rule books out, I'll go bankrupt
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:01.520]  because here's the deal. I offered 150,000 stickers out quietly at night and didn't,
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.320]  didn't even promote it. Put it on the website. The next day I plugged it once 3000 people
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:09.000]  emailed requesting the 50 free bumper stickers.
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:14.820]  Okay. In less than a day that evening and then into the show. And that was with shipping
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:20.520]  and the bumper stickers, I think, well, instead about $34,000, but, but we're doing it as
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:27.680]  a test because our missions get the word out. So I mean, it is important to hand them out,
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:31.520]  but most people think it's terrorist document. Have you ever seen the road to tyranny where
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:35.840]  the state police have a warrantless checkpoint in Virginia and they pull over a Navy veteran,
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:36.840]  no criminal record.
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:40.160]  My point is just canning equipment in the back of the car. That's why she'd gone to
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:44.920]  town and they thought that was very suspicious. And it's the squad car video and they find
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.400]  one of the same citizen rule books out of Arizona, that same company. And they start
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:56.680]  going, the two state police in behind. I mean, it's like it's a dead baby, of course, a dead
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:57.680]  baby.
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:00.100]  They'd probably like, oh, that's like pumpkin pie. That's what China does. That's good.
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:04.600]  But it's a, it's, it's got George Washington on it. They're like, this is scary. She may
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:10.580]  be one of them clan type people. Look, she's got a Patriot game movie and that's a mainline
[02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:15.280]  movie. They're in her trunk. She's got a VHS of a pretty much a pro government, you know,
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:17.640]  pro war movie, a pretty good movie, Patriot games.
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:23.960]  I guess Steve Pacinek was involved in that with, what's his name? The guy that plays
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:29.200]  hand solo and had one of those moments. Harrison Ford, yeah. I remember the most minute stuff
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.920]  and forget things like that. And they find that and they go, is this legal? They go,
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:38.440]  better go ahead and arrest her. I don't know if you're allowed to have this.
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:43.860]  It's the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence. We gotta air that sometime.
[02:47:43.860 --> 02:47:47.580]  It's online for free. It's like two hours into the film and they've got it because I
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:54.400]  show training videos where FEMA's demonizing the founding fathers in Missouri. And then
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:58.880]  in case people don't believe it, I then cut to her driving up to a checkpoint.
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:05.240]  She goes, no, you're not going to search me. This is an illegal checkpoint. And then of
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:09.240]  course for saying her fourth amendment, she's gotta be bad. So they've got her in handcuffs
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:17.680]  in the back of the car. And they open up the trunk, Harrison Ford, goodness gracious. And
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:18.680]  I'm not kidding.
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:24.440]  And then they find the Constitution. But they've sworn an oath to and you would think they
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:36.360]  had found literally a dead body. They're just like, my gosh, hold on a minute. I'm not joking
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:43.920]  right now. They're insane. They're insane. They're sticking robot spy systems on our
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:48.160]  houses that the CIA director brags are watching and listening to us.
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:52.480]  And we're like, you don't have a right. The cops are like, you're going to jail. George
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:49:02.920]  Washington's bad. Man, I can't handle, I'm sorry. It's in a sick way. I'm sorry, John,
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:03.920]  go ahead. I apologize.
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.200]  I just got to say, keep up the fight, man. I am and have a good day.
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:12.000]  I can't help it. I'm going to send you, but only you. I tell you what, put you on hold
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:17.160]  and I'll send you a hundred citizen rule books. How's that sound? Maybe I should just spend
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:24.960]  all our money, get out like 5 million bumper stickers and just quit. And put like nine
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.520]  smart meters on my house.
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:35.880]  Go get a law enforcement degree, go out and run checkpoints, taser all women. Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:43.320]  Just gobble fluoride, just promote vaccines all day. I could join the New World Order,
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:52.120]  it'd be good. GMO, it's all insane. I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This stuff's really
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:53.120]  starting to get to me.
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:50:01.920]  I mean, it's so insane. Cuz I'm here on air, realizing this is all really happening. And
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:07.200]  you know the public generally is not going to wake up, it's all going to happen. Yeah,
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:12.960]  the future of micro drones could get downright scary the size of mosquitoes. Here, let me,
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:16.560]  did you ever put up the CIA director, says your washing machine or your dryer is going
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:17.560]  to spy on you?
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:22.120]  You ever pull that up from Wired? Now pull it up. I mean, all day, it's not a big deal,
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  but I've been asking for it since the first hour. Here, let me type it in for you right
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:34.000]  now. You guys are great, but I mean, it's like that's really important. See, CIA director,
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.120]  your washer or dryer? I think it was dryer.
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:43.000]  Your dryer. No, he said dryer. That was one headline. He said dryer. The media said appliances.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:49.960]  Sure go with that. Appliances are, there it is. CIA chief will spy on you through your
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:55.520]  dishwasher. There it is. They already are. And I agree it's good. It's good that he's
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:51:01.160]  spied on by the CIA shipping in the narcotics. They're good people.
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:05.640]  Attention, gardeners and patriots, drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive
[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:10.480]  Federal Reserve debt monetizing are creating the perfect conditions for dramatically higher
[02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:15.200]  food prices in the months ahead. That means there has never been a better time to secure

[02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:05.200]  My name is Steven Huir. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:09.940]  most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So
[02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:14.020]  whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters
[02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:18.400]  like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:23.440]  brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:26.960]  one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:31.720]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I
[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:37.000]  got him on One World Way, and in two months, his constipation is gone. He's become friendlier.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:41.760]  He can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has made his first friend. He's
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:46.280]  doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. You could offer him
[02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:50.220]  a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.

[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:33.760]  By the way, the article again is up at infowars.com. Chris Rock is now saying in an anti-gun speech
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:44.360]  with the mayors against gun violence run by Bloomberg, that Obama is our daddy. Obama
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:48.600]  is our daddy. Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:55.320]  I am just here to support the president of the United States. The president of the United
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:55:03.200]  States is, you know, our boss, but he's also, you know, the president and the first lady
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:07.920]  are kind of like the mom and the dad of the country. And when your dad says something,
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:13.080]  you listen. And when you don't, it usually bites you in the ass later on.
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:17.920]  Well, there you go, Chris Rock. I'm here to support the president.
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:22.240]  All right, well, turn my guns in then. I mean, you said so. I mean, absolutely. He is my
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:28.800]  daddy and I'd better do what he says. Government is our God. You're right. I've been a bad
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:37.840]  man. I apologize. I want to apologize ultra deeply, ultra deeply, Chris, that, you know,
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:39.080]  and of course, you're a big liberal, too.
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:45.000]  I like what Obama's doing those torture bases. Again, you don't care. You get to feel powerful
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.480]  and feel good about yourself at the same time. That's what it's all about. Feel like you're
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:52.760]  part of a winning crew. So Chris, drink that fluoride, take those shots and enjoy your
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:55.720]  private security detail that have firearms.
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:00.360]  But you're going to fail. I like all the nice priest and other interesting looking creepy
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:05.300]  characters up there with you. Just I mean, every time they have these anti gun control
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:09.040]  groups or these police chiefs and people, I mean, they all look like super creepy people,
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:10.040]  don't they?
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:13.480]  You see all the cops that are out there for guns and sheriffs. They all are well spoken
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:17.160]  focus, look manly, have a twinkle in their eye. You can just tell they're good people.
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:21.160]  You can just see it. And you see these anti gunners. I mean, they're a bunch of sniveling
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:27.720]  piles of dog crap. Excuse me. I'm sick of you people. I'll tell you the real reason
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:31.560]  I've been screwing around all hour and making jokes because I'm actually in a rage, man.
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:34.680]  I'll tell you right now, I'm sick of these people. I'm sick of them. I know who they
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:39.320]  are. I know what you're doing. I'm sick of all your crimes. I'm sick of what you're doing
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:46.920]  to innocent people. I'm tired of your frauds. I'm angry. I want to bring you to justice.
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:52.160]  You will be brought to justice. Alan in New Jersey, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:58.320]  Hey, how are you? Good. Um, I wanted to, um, see, get your take and see if you've heard
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:04.440]  anything about this. Um, you know, as you most likely know, steel team for their primary
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:10.240]  objective is to guard diplomats when they're in the middle East. And, uh, I have a personal
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:16.400]  relationship to commander Job Price, the leader of steel team for, and I want to know if you
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:21.200]  heard anything about his death and the supposed, uh, if you go to the European union times,
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:25.080]  there's an amazing article on what real, what they think really happened.
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:30.560]  And there's a lot of data in there that he flew with four other seals. The Bahrain got
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:36.560]  on a flight with Hillary Clinton in late December. Uh, there's a reason a bunch of seals are
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:40.120]  dying with that source. You give is not a good source from my experience, but I appreciate
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:44.320]  your call. Uh, the people, you know, personally send us some information. I mean, you know,
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:47.920]  tell your story. We'll, we'll check it and vet it. You got photos with this guy, we'll
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:48.920]  publish it.
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:53.400]  Um, but you know, they kill seals all the time cause that's who they use as their black
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:58.440]  op commandos. And of course they actually take them out of seals. That's the only people
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:03.880]  that gets the last level. There's like five more levels above seals and then Delta force
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:11.240]  and then groups above that, um, men associated with special forces. We'll just put it to
[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:16.480]  you that way because I've had family that have been involved in it and the whole thing
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:21.480]  is you're actually working for the globalist. Okay. I love, I always talk about that and
[02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:24.840]  the people that say I'm a government agent never use that cause it's my admission, but
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:28.680]  it's not like it's a bad admission. I'm exposing that the stuff's going on, but then they make
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:32.240]  up intelligence community connections that aren't there, you know, because, cause it's
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:36.720]  them breaking it. See, it's them making it up. It doesn't matter. All right, I'm going
[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:47.880]  to come back with more calls transmission. Thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com

[02:59:55.880 --> 03:00:09.360]  listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. Big brother, mainstream media, government
[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:18.120]  cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:33.680]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, ladies and gentlemen, doing a little
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:40.720]  bit of overdrive here. Little dessert, taking a few of your calls. I got to about 45, 50
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:46.160]  articles a day. I did OK. Should have got to all hundred and something, but. Got a special
[03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:49.640]  show tomorrow. I'll just leave it at that for you. A lot of special reports are going
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:50.640]  to be aired here.
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:58.060]  A lot of live reports tomorrow. Look, it's the inability to wake up to classical tyranny
[03:00:58.060 --> 03:01:02.800]  with a high tech icing that is hurting us. I mean, things have already gotten cuckoo
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:08.840]  level dangerous. It'd be like being in a ship that's listening over to one side about to
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:12.880]  capsize and people are still eating caviar and champagne going everything's great. Shut
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:16.220]  up, conspiracy theorist.
[03:01:16.220 --> 03:01:22.400]  And you know, we could still fix the ship. But this always happens in decadent societies.
[03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:26.680]  People don't grow up under real adversity. So as they go into a scientific adversity,
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:30.480]  they don't know how to resist it. And then they lie to themselves and acclimate themselves
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:36.400]  to any new level of abuse. And it's called being a biological robot. I mean, a conscious
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:40.620]  alive person can navigate and choose their destiny within their own mind that they can
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:45.360]  choose who you want to be, who you want to stand for that you can do.
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:49.000]  And I just ask God, I'm gonna take a few final calls here to energize me because I've really
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:54.360]  been exhausting myself and I need the energy and I need the focus and I need the discernment
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:01:58.720]  to navigate this Heavenly Father and I want everybody to pray. I need this help. And I
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:03.320]  pray for our listeners as well. Please, please give me the energy. You know, I care about
[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:05.160]  the people and I just want to defeat the tyranny.
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:09.760]  I want to be your vessel. I'm weak. Please help me. Please energize me, please. If that's
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:15.720]  your will, help me. Help me get the word out. Help me, God. That's all I can say. Donna
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:18.640]  in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:21.720]  Hi, Alex. Yes, welcome.
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:31.880]  Hi, I'm newly awake. So I just started learning about all this chaos that's going on. Anyway,
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:37.860]  I was watching The Daily Show last night because they had Ray Kelly on. He's the New York City
[03:02:37.860 --> 03:02:45.200]  Police Commissioner talking about guns. He's changing the script up. He's now saying that
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:49.160]  he's not worried about the big guns. The big guns aren't the problem.
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:55.040]  He's worried about handguns. Yeah. No, no, they're always demonized one. Then I said
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:59.480]  they'd move to handguns. Obama during the second debate gave out the script. I said,
[03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:03.600]  it'll first be rifles, semi-auto, then it'll be handguns. It's all script. They've done
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:14.360]  it everywhere. It's an exact script. Yeah, I can't believe it. I'm still in shock. Because
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:20.520]  I'm newly awake, it hurts me. Well, it should hurt you. That means you've got your head
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:24.280]  screwed on straight. You learn about this stuff, it does hurt. But that hurting's good.
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:30.920]  That's your guts waking up. Yeah, it's not good to know you've been lied to.
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:34.880]  Well, first it's gonna hit you in the belly. Then it's gonna hit you in the heart. First
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:37.960]  your belly for a while, it might take a month, it might take a year. You're gonna feel it
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:42.240]  down here and it's scary. Then your heart's gonna get warm and fiery feeling. And then
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:45.720]  after that happens, it transfers right up here to the cerebral cortex.
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:49.400]  Cuz your gut, your heart, your head, it's how it's worked with me and so many others.
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:53.720]  And then once you get that fire in the mind of man that Thomas Jefferson talked about,
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:59.240]  look out. Believe me, you want that to come as quickly as possible. That your combat reflexes
[03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:02.860]  are turning on. You're firing up. They're flipping the switches. Humans are incredible
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:06.680]  creatures. The switches are getting flipped on right now.
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:10.920]  So it's gonna get a lot better. All right, don't worry, you're designed to fight evil.
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:18.600]  Yeah, a little inspiration to you. You found a little down. I asked God for guidance and
[03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:24.200]  to show me the right way and Fran pointed me in the direction of your show. So I think
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:26.680]  God's using you. He's using you as a tool.
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:31.320]  Well as out of control as I am, I am that imperfect tool and so are you to ram up against
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:37.560]  the enemy. And that is my job. I know that I'm doing God's will. I just I feel so honored
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:42.080]  and so pathetic like dirty rags. I see all the mistakes. I'm everything I just say God
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:47.240]  help me do it better. But God's like you are doing what I want. Now attack them. Throw
[03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:57.160]  everything against them now. Now. Now forward more, more, more burning in my bones. We'll
[03:04:57.160 --> 03:05:24.120]  be right back. God bless you all.
