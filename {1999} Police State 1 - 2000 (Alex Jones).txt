[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Music
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.500]  And rest in peace, and rest in peace,
[00:25.500 --> 00:31.000]  with the dentist in peace.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  Look, oh, do not, and do not,
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  look, oh, and do not sin.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  And the dentist, the dentist,
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.500]  the medicine who canheat,
[00:52.500 --> 00:57.500]  and the God who can prove
[00:57.500 --> 01:01.700]  that the Captain has done
[01:01.700 --> 01:06.000]  a grand miracle.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  The Pope, the apostle,
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  has done a grand miracle
[01:14.000 --> 01:24.800]  Oh, oh, grata, let the latter be king concreta in teres.
[01:24.800 --> 01:35.300]  Nun, em, nun, dun, dorsum, nun, dun, ferroto in seleris.
[01:35.300 --> 01:56.100]  Nun, nun, dun, dorsum, nun, dorsum, nun, dorsum, nun, dun, ferroto in seleris.
[01:56.100 --> 02:22.160]  Nun, nun, dorsum, nun, dorsum, nun,
[02:32.960 --> 02:36.160]  We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this important bulletin from the United Press.
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.160]  Flats, Washington.
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.160]  We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.
[02:40.160 --> 02:41.160]  The German news agency.
[02:41.160 --> 02:44.160]  We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin from Washington.
[02:44.160 --> 02:46.160]  Special report, verdict sparks violence.
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.160]  National Guard troops are standing by ready to patrol the streets of Los Angeles rocked by widespread violence.
[02:52.160 --> 02:54.160]  My name's Alex Jones.
[02:54.160 --> 02:56.160]  I'm a radio and television host in Austin, Texas.
[02:56.160 --> 03:03.160]  And for many years I've been exposing the criminal activities of the global elite, otherwise known as the New World Order.
[03:03.160 --> 03:10.160]  These folks don't make their money out of the production of goods and services or via creativity.
[03:10.160 --> 03:16.160]  They make their money and their stock and trade is slavery, control of populations.
[03:16.160 --> 03:26.160]  In the next two hours you will see hardcore documentation, evidence that is irrefutable that America is turning into a nightmarish police state,
[03:26.160 --> 03:36.160]  cameras on the street corners, mass checkpoints on our major interstate highways, warrantless searches.
[03:36.160 --> 03:47.160]  But worst of all, you'll see America's military being perverted, being turned into an instrument of control, not an instrument of defense.
[03:47.160 --> 03:50.160]  I have footage and you're going to see it.
[03:50.160 --> 04:04.160]  Marines engaging in mock gun confiscations, kicking in doors, setting up concentration camps and working with foreign troops from China, Russia, Britain, Australia.
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.160]  It's incredible, my friends, and you've got to face up to it.
[04:08.160 --> 04:11.160]  I've got to face up to it and we've got to take action.
[04:11.160 --> 04:22.160]  But perhaps worst of all is the Delta Force, Army Special Operations from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, slamming into South Texas towns during Operation Last Dance.
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.160]  Buildings ablaze, power lines down, live fire exercises.
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.160]  The citizenry terrorized.
[04:30.160 --> 04:32.160]  Again, this isn't some foreign country.
[04:32.160 --> 04:38.160]  This is America, psychological warfare against the population.
[04:38.160 --> 04:47.160]  Why are armored personnel carriers being delivered every week to small towns and big cities, not for the military, but for police?
[04:47.160 --> 04:51.160]  Why is the military training with our police?
[04:51.160 --> 04:53.160]  And what's happening?
[04:53.160 --> 04:58.160]  My friends, this is the battle for the republic.
[04:58.160 --> 05:01.160]  The enemy is not our police and it's not our military.
[05:01.160 --> 05:12.160]  It is those that would pervert and twist the sacred oath that our peace officers and military folks have sworn to uphold.
[05:12.160 --> 05:18.160]  That is to defend our country from enemies foreign and domestic.
[05:18.160 --> 05:26.160]  It's up to you, this whole criminal system, this whole undertaking that we see unfolding before our eyes is done through ignorance.
[05:26.160 --> 05:35.160]  It's up to you to educate the cop that lives next door to you or to talk to your friend who's a captain or a colonel or a general or a private in the United States military.
[05:35.160 --> 05:41.160]  It's up to you to educate them about what's happening and refresh their memory about history.
[05:41.160 --> 05:45.160]  We are repeating what happened in 1933 Germany.
[05:45.160 --> 05:47.160]  My friends, it's up to you.
[05:47.160 --> 05:51.160]  In the next two hours, again, you're going to see the documentation.
[05:51.160 --> 05:58.160]  It's irrefutable and I challenge you to research the information you'll see born out in this documentary.
[05:58.160 --> 06:02.160]  Here are just a few of the scenes you'll see in the next two hours.
[06:02.160 --> 06:07.160]  So sit back and educate yourselves about what's happening to our nation.
[06:07.160 --> 06:11.160]  As I said, it is a battle for the republic.
[06:11.160 --> 06:13.160]  What are you doing, sir?
[06:13.160 --> 06:15.160]  Having a good time?
[06:15.160 --> 06:18.160]  How's it going over at the camp?
[06:18.160 --> 06:24.160]  I'm feeling well. The guys are doing a bit of exercise now.
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.160]  They're doing very well.
[06:26.160 --> 06:30.160]  So the camp situation is going good with the disarmament and things?
[06:30.160 --> 06:31.160]  Oh, yeah.
[06:31.160 --> 06:33.160]  Because we saw them over there disarming people. Is that what the exercise is?
[06:33.160 --> 06:35.160]  They're exercising now, yeah.
[06:35.160 --> 06:37.160]  Fantastic. Where are you from, sir?
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.160]  Holland.
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.160]  Oh, okay.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.160]  From the best Marines.
[06:40.160 --> 06:52.160]  Fantastic.
[06:52.160 --> 07:04.160]  Get up! Get up!
[07:04.160 --> 07:11.160]  No! We're in crime!
[07:11.160 --> 07:32.160]  Lady!
[07:32.160 --> 07:35.160]  I need to get to the town mayor. She's in a meeting.
[07:35.160 --> 07:37.160]  Okay, let's go and bring those two in.
[07:37.160 --> 07:39.160]  Do you need a message from that person?
[07:39.160 --> 07:40.160]  Not a message.
[07:40.160 --> 07:41.160]  Yeah, we're going to get fed.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.160]  Thank you.
[07:42.160 --> 07:43.160]  You need to get fed.
[07:43.160 --> 07:45.160]  Let us out, let us out.
[07:45.160 --> 08:03.160]  I need to get through.
[08:03.160 --> 08:19.160]  Attention, attention, attention.
[08:19.160 --> 08:23.160]  American forces are here to help. Remain calm.
[08:23.160 --> 08:26.160]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[08:26.160 --> 08:28.160]  What do you see? What do you hear?
[08:28.160 --> 08:34.160]  Well, they were throwing some bombs, you know, bombing.
[08:34.160 --> 08:35.160]  Right.
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.160]  Yeah. And some, I think they were using some rifles too.
[08:38.160 --> 08:42.160]  And the other kind of rifles, you know, the one you just, you know, stuff like that.
[08:42.160 --> 08:47.160]  Looking at your windows, seeing unmarked helicopters and troops dressed in
[08:47.160 --> 09:07.160]  ninja black suit with a bow rifle. It's kind of spooky.
[09:07.160 --> 09:12.160]  Hello, Boston SS.
[09:12.160 --> 09:18.160]  I would have said that Alex.
[09:18.160 --> 09:19.160]  Get on.
[09:19.160 --> 09:20.160]  Okay.
[09:20.160 --> 09:21.160]  Get the search lights.
[09:21.160 --> 09:22.160]  Yeah.
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.160]  Hello, my friend.
[09:23.160 --> 09:27.160]  Come on.
[09:27.160 --> 09:31.160]  Warrantless, random searches on America's interstate highways.
[09:31.160 --> 09:35.160]  We think this is good a place as any to start our story.
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.160]  I know what some of you are thinking though.
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.160]  You're thinking, hey, there must have been a child molester or an axe murderer loose.
[09:41.160 --> 09:46.160]  You know, my friends, these are warrantless, random searches.
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.160]  All part of being guilty until proven innocent.
[09:51.160 --> 09:53.160]  The checkpoints.
[09:53.160 --> 09:59.160]  Brought to you by something as innocuous, at least seemingly as the presidential
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.160]  initiative on seatbelt use.
[10:03.160 --> 10:11.160]  The Clinton administration's supposed liberals allotted over 2 billion plus dollars for
[10:11.160 --> 10:16.160]  1999 alone for nationwide Nazi behavior.
[10:16.160 --> 10:19.160]  But not just the socialist and the Democratic Party.
[10:19.160 --> 10:20.160]  Oh, no.
[10:20.160 --> 10:26.160]  The Republicans and the Supreme Court have been backing warrantless searches of
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.160]  anybody the police feel like pulling over and harassing.
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.160]  In a police state, police don't have to work very hard, but in a republic and a
[10:35.160 --> 10:37.160]  country with freedom, they do.
[10:37.160 --> 10:39.160]  This is not an attack on the police.
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.160]  It's a cry for help to every American.
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.160]  Now we're about to go out and speak to some of the police and expose what they're
[10:46.160 --> 10:51.160]  doing and hopefully reactivate their conscience.
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.160]  We are entering the eye of the checkpoint.
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.160]  Caution, reduce speed, checkpoint ahead.
[10:57.160 --> 10:59.160]  Isn't that loving, children?
[10:59.160 --> 11:09.160]  A nice big generator running that.
[11:09.160 --> 11:12.160]  Well, here's the love, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:12.160 --> 11:13.160]  America.
[11:13.160 --> 11:15.160]  Here to take care of you.
[11:15.160 --> 11:18.160]  This happens all the time, right here in Austin, Texas.
[11:18.160 --> 11:21.160]  Just south Austin to be exact.
[11:21.160 --> 11:25.160]  Well, there's the command unit over there.
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.160]  Nice big Winnebago.
[11:28.160 --> 11:40.160]  Ah, shine their lights in people's face.
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.160]  Hello, Poppin SS.
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.160]  I would have said that, Alex.
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.160]  I got it.
[11:52.160 --> 11:54.160]  Get the search lines.
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.160]  Yeah, my friend.
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.160]  We're going to go back through the gauntlet and we've got them just pulling them back,
[12:03.160 --> 12:06.160]  pulling them off down there, pulling them off here, all part of Bill Clinton's funding
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.160]  and they love it.
[12:09.160 --> 12:10.160]  We're exiting.
[12:10.160 --> 12:11.160]  We're turning around.
[12:11.160 --> 12:13.160]  We're going down the access road this time.
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.160]  There's another one right there.
[12:17.160 --> 12:23.160]  Look at the traffic they got back there.
[12:23.160 --> 12:24.160]  Guys, here we go.
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.160]  Look at the traffic they got backed up.
[12:27.160 --> 12:29.160]  It is monumental.
[12:29.160 --> 12:31.160]  This night vision camera comes in.
[12:31.160 --> 12:34.160]  Just line it up.
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.160]  Oh my God, we are in a police day.
[12:37.160 --> 12:41.160]  All right, let's go.
[12:41.160 --> 12:44.160]  Get it, get it.
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.160]  Oh, yes, sir.
[12:45.160 --> 12:46.160]  I'm a syndicated talk show host.
[12:46.160 --> 12:47.160]  I'll also make documentaries.
[12:47.160 --> 12:52.160]  I'm out here covering this.
[12:52.160 --> 12:54.160]  Let's walk on down, Hanson.
[12:54.160 --> 12:56.160]  You lead the way.
[12:56.160 --> 13:00.160]  I'm sure to come over here in a second.
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.160]  Hey, this night vision works good.
[13:04.160 --> 13:07.160]  Here it is, my friends, America.
[13:07.160 --> 13:13.160]  $2.4 billion by Bill Clinton 1999 for federal checkpoints, federal funding.
[13:13.160 --> 13:18.160]  You're seeing MJTF right now, police from all different counties in central Texas and Austin
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.160]  working together, bringing you to police state.
[13:21.160 --> 13:22.160]  It's a lot worse.
[13:22.160 --> 13:24.160]  The war against guns is raging.
[13:24.160 --> 13:37.160]  We're in 1936 Germany right now.
[13:37.160 --> 13:38.160]  I'm going to try to interview one.
[13:38.160 --> 13:40.160]  How much time we got left on the battery?
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.160]  57.
[13:41.160 --> 13:42.160]  Here we go, guys.
[13:42.160 --> 13:49.160]  We're getting shined on right here.
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.160]  We're getting a lot shined on us by the black uniforms, everything.
[13:53.160 --> 13:54.160]  This is incredible.
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.160]  This is incredible.
[13:57.160 --> 14:03.160]  Look at that aggressive behavior.
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.160]  Guys, America is in deep trouble.
[14:06.160 --> 14:08.160]  Hey, are y'all MJTF?
[14:08.160 --> 14:11.160]  Is this an MJTF operation?
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.160]  Oh, this is cheap.
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.160]  Do you even know where this funding comes from?
[14:20.160 --> 14:26.160]  Yeah, this stuff is real, sir.
[14:26.160 --> 14:28.160]  And y'all can rationalize what you're doing.
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.160]  There'll be more decisions for you in the future.
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.160]  We made it out there at about 11 p.m.
[14:35.160 --> 14:40.160]  The checkpoint had been going since 6 p.m. that night during peak traffic time on IH 35.
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.160]  So we walked on over and asked the officers a few questions, just to find out if they
[14:45.160 --> 14:47.160]  had any idea what they were engaging in.
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.160]  Because remember, this whole thing is run out of ignorance.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.160]  How you doing?
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.160]  My name's Alex Jones, and I'm here to talk to you all.
[14:55.160 --> 14:56.160]  How you doing?
[14:56.160 --> 14:57.160]  Thank you very much.
[14:57.160 --> 15:02.160]  We're just curious about the different details of this multi-jurisdictional task force operation here.
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.160]  Or is this just an Austin operation?
[15:05.160 --> 15:10.160]  Where is he?
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.160]  We can talk to him in about two minutes.
[15:13.160 --> 15:15.160]  He's the way back by the van.
[15:15.160 --> 15:26.160]  How many people have y'all apprehended?
[15:26.160 --> 15:46.160]  In that sense, you bring in drugs?
[15:46.160 --> 15:47.160]  Oh, that's tough.
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.160]  We're going across the street, sir?
[15:49.160 --> 15:50.160]  Across the street.
[15:50.160 --> 15:52.160]  Alright, so because we're not picking blue bonnet, so we can't be here.
[15:52.160 --> 15:53.160]  Across the street.
[15:53.160 --> 15:56.160]  Understand, thank you very much, I'm picking blue bonnet.
[15:56.160 --> 15:59.160]  You know, I just want to get out of the car.
[15:59.160 --> 16:00.160]  It's so easy.
[16:00.160 --> 16:04.160]  It's not America anymore.
[16:04.160 --> 16:09.160]  Oh, we've been escorted.
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.160]  Well, y'all tell me I can talk to your superior and I'll be waiting over here.
[16:12.160 --> 16:13.160]  Thank you, thank you very much.
[16:13.160 --> 16:14.160]  Like them people, I'm beautiful.
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.160]  Okay, okay.
[16:15.160 --> 16:17.160]  Like, why aren't y'all wearing your combat?
[16:17.160 --> 16:18.160]  Oh, he's wearing his combat boots.
[16:18.160 --> 16:19.160]  Get a shot.
[16:19.160 --> 16:20.160]  We like that.
[16:20.160 --> 16:22.160]  Hey, hey, yeah.
[16:22.160 --> 16:23.160]  We're into the Dexter's Code.
[16:23.160 --> 16:24.160]  You're not beautiful.
[16:24.160 --> 16:25.160]  I'm the head.
[16:25.160 --> 16:26.160]  Who cares about room?
[16:26.160 --> 16:27.160]  We'll split.
[16:27.160 --> 16:40.160]  I'll tell you, this is it, guys.
[16:40.160 --> 16:41.160]  They're laughing.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.160]  Get shots up.
[16:42.160 --> 16:44.160]  They're over there laughing about this death of this country.
[16:44.160 --> 16:45.160]  Look at them.
[16:45.160 --> 16:48.160]  Over there laughing about the death of our nation.
[16:48.160 --> 16:49.160]  I got it.
[16:49.160 --> 16:51.160]  Over there thinking it's funny.
[16:51.160 --> 16:53.160]  You guys want to clean the drugs off the street?
[16:53.160 --> 16:56.160]  Go after the CIA.
[16:56.160 --> 16:58.160]  You guys want to clean the drugs off the street?
[16:58.160 --> 17:00.160]  Go after the government.
[17:00.160 --> 17:03.160]  I wouldn't use that government bill for a million dollars.
[17:03.160 --> 17:05.160]  But I won't lose my liberties.
[17:05.160 --> 17:09.160]  I got given rights.
[17:09.160 --> 17:11.160]  Total cowards.
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.160]  Total complete cowards.
[17:14.160 --> 17:16.160]  Going along to get along.
[17:16.160 --> 17:20.160]  That is shameful right here in Texas.
[17:20.160 --> 17:22.160]  My God.
[17:22.160 --> 17:25.160]  Yeah, they get their $30,000 to $40,000 a year.
[17:25.160 --> 17:29.160]  They're 20 pieces of silver to sell us down the river.
[17:29.160 --> 17:40.160]  Oh, a pension's in the rest of it.
[17:40.160 --> 17:41.160]  Selling our country out.
[17:41.160 --> 17:42.160]  God.
[17:42.160 --> 17:52.160]  What are we doing, sir?
[17:52.160 --> 17:53.160]  Radio talks you.
[17:53.160 --> 17:54.160]  Now it's Jones.
[17:54.160 --> 17:55.160]  How you doing?
[17:55.160 --> 17:56.160]  What's your name, sir?
[17:56.160 --> 17:57.160]  James.
[17:57.160 --> 17:58.160]  This is night vision camera.
[17:58.160 --> 17:59.160]  Sir, this is reminiscent of Nazi Germany.
[17:59.160 --> 18:00.160]  I'll get somebody to talk to.
[18:00.160 --> 18:02.160]  Well, they were telling us the person in charge would come.
[18:02.160 --> 18:12.160]  I'll get him.
[18:12.160 --> 18:13.160]  Okay.
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.160]  Left.
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.160]  Left.
[18:15.160 --> 18:16.160]  Oh, here we go.
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.160]  Yeah, the Pac-Man mentality.
[18:17.160 --> 18:18.160]  Yes.
[18:18.160 --> 18:19.160]  Yes.
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.160]  Deal with it.
[18:20.160 --> 18:21.160]  Nice crew cut.
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.160]  Why don't you fight for America?
[18:22.160 --> 18:27.160]  We've been asking for an interview for $30,000 to $40,000.
[18:27.160 --> 18:32.160]  And they're just standing over there.
[18:32.160 --> 18:37.160]  And the head guy walked over and then ran off and talked about how there are a bunch of Nazis.
[18:37.160 --> 18:38.160]  I didn't call them Nazis.
[18:38.160 --> 18:40.160]  I just said Nazi-like activities.
[18:40.160 --> 18:46.160]  Nazi-like activities.
[18:46.160 --> 18:48.160]  You know, the whole city, people just love it.
[18:48.160 --> 18:49.160]  Look, I'm shot.
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.160]  Oh, they're shot in the right in their face.
[18:51.160 --> 18:52.160]  Look at that.
[18:52.160 --> 18:54.160]  And he follows them along, too, Alex.
[18:54.160 --> 18:55.160]  Look how they follow him along.
[18:55.160 --> 18:57.160]  Look at that car.
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.160]  So what?
[18:58.160 --> 18:59.160]  Look how he follows them along.
[18:59.160 --> 19:04.160]  Doing a fine job there.
[19:04.160 --> 19:07.160]  People, they wave a little scared sheep.
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.160]  Yeah, I didn't wave.
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.160]  And the reason we didn't wave is because we're not going to sanction this behavior.
[19:14.160 --> 19:20.160]  Culturally, we have to explain that it's not to be condoned because it's a slippery slope,
[19:20.160 --> 19:21.160]  my friends.
[19:21.160 --> 19:24.160]  Doesn't this kind of seem like Nazi Germany to you?
[19:24.160 --> 19:29.160]  I mean, aren't we innocent until proven guilty instead of guilty until proven innocent?
[19:29.160 --> 19:30.160]  I couldn't talk to you about this, sir.
[19:30.160 --> 19:31.160]  I'm just going to do my job.
[19:31.160 --> 19:32.160]  It's just your job?
[19:32.160 --> 19:33.160]  Yes, sir.
[19:33.160 --> 19:34.160]  But hey, well, you know who else said that?
[19:34.160 --> 19:35.160]  Who said that?
[19:35.160 --> 19:36.160]  Well, at Nuremberg.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.160]  Okay.
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.160]  They just really, let's take a break.
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.160]  All right, thanks.
[19:40.160 --> 19:42.160]  How many folks you pulled over tonight?
[19:42.160 --> 19:45.160]  I don't know what it's in.
[19:45.160 --> 19:50.160]  A lot of traffic stops tonight.
[19:50.160 --> 19:52.160]  Oh, you've made three personally.
[19:52.160 --> 19:54.160]  We appreciate that, sir.
[19:54.160 --> 19:55.160]  Thank you.
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.160]  Well, that's a nice black sedan.
[19:57.160 --> 20:00.160]  You said we don't talk to them.
[20:00.160 --> 20:03.160]  Man, all these federal funds come in for this.
[20:03.160 --> 20:07.160]  I thought in America we're innocent until proven guilty.
[20:07.160 --> 20:10.160]  Are we innocent until proven guilty?
[20:10.160 --> 20:12.160]  Are you guilty of something?
[20:12.160 --> 20:14.160]  No, I'm not guilty of anything.
[20:14.160 --> 20:17.160]  Oh, I thought you were asking me were you innocent until proven guilty?
[20:17.160 --> 20:21.160]  But I mean, aren't we all supposed, you know, in this country, you know, other countries
[20:21.160 --> 20:24.160]  like Germany under Hitler wasn't that way or under Stalin, it wasn't that way.
[20:24.160 --> 20:28.160]  But here in America, aren't we supposed to be innocent until proven guilty?
[20:28.160 --> 20:29.160]  That's true.
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.160]  That's true.
[20:30.160 --> 20:31.160]  There you go.
[20:31.160 --> 20:32.160]  Talk to us.
[20:32.160 --> 20:35.160]  Well, I mean, I don't hate police or anything, but at the same time, you've got to wonder,
[20:35.160 --> 20:39.160]  this is happening all over the country now because the federal funds that are flowing.
[20:39.160 --> 20:42.160]  I mean, isn't that interesting?
[20:42.160 --> 20:44.160]  He's talking to the wrong person.
[20:44.160 --> 20:46.160]  You're talking to the wrong person?
[20:46.160 --> 20:48.160]  He's talking to the wrong person.
[20:48.160 --> 20:51.160]  Gentlemen, what's your name? I'm just curious.
[20:51.160 --> 20:52.160]  Johnson.
[20:52.160 --> 20:54.160]  How you doing, sir?
[20:54.160 --> 20:56.160]  Good to talk to you.
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.160]  Y'all like this sedan?
[20:58.160 --> 20:59.160]  That's all right.
[20:59.160 --> 21:03.160]  What do y'all call these units? I see a lot of these around town.
[21:03.160 --> 21:05.160]  Just an unmarked police unit.
[21:05.160 --> 21:08.160]  Did they call y'all in and tell you the procedure?
[21:08.160 --> 21:11.160]  That's what it was.
[21:11.160 --> 21:14.160]  Well, basically, how do they pick people out of the crowd to pull over?
[21:14.160 --> 21:15.160]  That's what we're curious.
[21:15.160 --> 21:18.160]  I don't know. If you go down right over there and talk to one of them superpowers,
[21:18.160 --> 21:19.160]  they can tell you everything about it.
[21:19.160 --> 21:21.160]  They didn't tell you all the procedure.
[21:21.160 --> 21:23.160]  Basically, they just called y'all to tell you all about it.
[21:23.160 --> 21:27.160]  Well, if you go right over there and talk to a superpowers, they didn't tell you all about it.
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.160]  Because I didn't do them a job, brother.
[21:29.160 --> 21:30.160]  Okay.
[21:30.160 --> 21:33.160]  They can tell you all the procedure because they put it together. We did.
[21:33.160 --> 21:35.160]  You guys are just doing your jobs?
[21:35.160 --> 21:36.160]  Right.
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.160]  All right. Well, I'm not attacking y'all, but think about this.
[21:41.160 --> 21:45.160]  It may come in time when you see some things on television that are manufactured by the government.
[21:45.160 --> 21:47.160]  They're asking y'all to do some things that don't really sound right,
[21:47.160 --> 21:50.160]  but there's a rush of everything. Everybody working together.
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.160]  Feeling like y'all are part of a team.
[21:52.160 --> 21:55.160]  Going along with some things that aren't good.
[21:55.160 --> 21:57.160]  And, um...
[21:57.160 --> 22:00.160]  Well, just the whole thing's accelerating.
[22:00.160 --> 22:02.160]  That's right.
[22:02.160 --> 22:07.160]  There's a lot of things accelerating in the world today that aren't too nice.
[22:07.160 --> 22:15.160]  Would you guys, if ordered to do so, would y'all confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens or go house to house?
[22:15.160 --> 22:17.160]  Who would order you to do something that's against the law?
[22:17.160 --> 22:19.160]  It's against the law. They're talking about changing, man.
[22:19.160 --> 22:22.160]  Well, I mean, if they change the law, that's what the law says.
[22:22.160 --> 22:24.160]  How do they change the law without changing the Constitution?
[22:24.160 --> 22:25.160]  I don't know.
[22:25.160 --> 22:27.160]  We're talking Congress about that one.
[22:27.160 --> 22:32.160]  Well, yeah, the President uses those executive orders.
[22:32.160 --> 22:36.160]  Well, guys, that'd be some innocent time today, everybody.
[22:36.160 --> 22:39.160]  Two important points. He said, go back and talk to his superiors.
[22:39.160 --> 22:41.160]  We were there for over two and a half hours.
[22:41.160 --> 22:49.160]  And the second point, these two gentlemen, probably decent people, at least they talked to us,
[22:49.160 --> 22:55.160]  don't realize that an unconstitutional law does not have to be obeyed.
[22:55.160 --> 23:00.160]  In fact, I could harken back to Rosa Parks, going to jail for not sitting at the back of the bus.
[23:00.160 --> 23:05.160]  It was the law that black people were slaves, but later it was found to be unconstitutional.
[23:05.160 --> 23:08.160]  Laws are not holy.
[23:08.160 --> 23:16.160]  Laws are not magical if handed down by some despotic out-of-control police state.
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.160]  Well, we were now on the other side of the highway,
[23:20.160 --> 23:23.160]  and we were talking to some of the truckers about what was going on.
[23:23.160 --> 23:26.160]  The police continually were keying down the CB.
[23:26.160 --> 23:29.160]  Here's just a little bit of this activity.
[23:29.160 --> 23:35.160]  It's the junior high mentality of our law enforcement personnel that is the most frightening aspect.
[23:35.160 --> 23:37.160]  It's a big game.
[23:45.160 --> 23:50.160]  Well, absolutely all our newest nuclear weapons designs have been transferred to China.
[23:50.160 --> 23:54.160]  5,000 pounds of plutonium came up missing.
[23:54.160 --> 23:57.160]  It goes on and on. America is under attack, my friends.
[23:57.160 --> 23:59.160]  This is just the start of what's happening.
[23:59.160 --> 24:05.160]  And Bill Clinton is funding this with 2.4 billion that he got passed just last year.
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.160]  Not long have these police are such cowards and keep keying down on radios
[24:14.160 --> 24:17.160]  because they don't want to hear the truth like little junior high kids.
[24:22.160 --> 24:26.160]  Hey, let me tell you something, police. I'm not afraid of you. You're a bunch of criminals.
[24:26.160 --> 24:28.160]  You're a bunch of weaklings.
[24:28.160 --> 24:32.160]  I'm ashamed to be a part of this country because of people like you.
[24:35.160 --> 24:38.160]  Well, have fun, police. You're an idiot. You're an idiot.
[24:38.160 --> 24:41.160]  Well, Chief Alley, Philippus and San Antonio wouldn't an idiot
[24:41.160 --> 24:44.160]  when he threw the Delta Force out in May, but you won't research that.
[24:44.160 --> 24:51.160]  You're about to see an interview we conducted in mid-May in 1998
[24:51.160 --> 24:56.160]  with the Chief of Police of San Antonio, Texas, Chief Alley, Philippus.
[24:56.160 --> 25:02.160]  The chief was very concerned about what he called the attempts at bribery
[25:02.160 --> 25:04.160]  by Army's police.
[25:04.160 --> 25:10.160]  The chief was very concerned about what he called the attempts at bribery
[25:10.160 --> 25:14.160]  by Army Special Operations Delta Force.
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.160]  Also, the endangerment of public safety, all very serious issues.
[25:19.160 --> 25:23.160]  This interview is a watershed event because as far as we know,
[25:23.160 --> 25:29.160]  this is the first time that local law enforcement, local police leadership
[25:29.160 --> 25:33.160]  has actively stood up against Bill Clinton's new military
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.160]  or the globalist New World Order type military
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.160]  where they come into towns and terrorize the public.
[25:41.160 --> 25:44.160]  Again, God bless Chief Alley, Philippus.
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.160]  What were your major reservations in asking the mayor to tell them
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.160]  that y'all didn't want them to train here and to cease training here?
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.160]  Well, a lot of things happened.
[25:54.160 --> 25:57.160]  First of all, the organization came into the city
[25:57.160 --> 26:00.160]  and never really approached the city as a whole
[26:00.160 --> 26:02.160]  and was gotten together with the mayor and said,
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.160]  we need to speak to all these different departments and request some assistance.
[26:07.160 --> 26:10.160]  Various groups and individuals came into the city
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.160]  and approached different people at different levels.
[26:13.160 --> 26:15.160]  The police department was contacted.
[26:15.160 --> 26:19.160]  The city manager's office was contacted about using city facilities.
[26:19.160 --> 26:23.160]  Various business owners were contacted through the economic development department.
[26:23.160 --> 26:26.160]  The fire department was contacted by different individuals.
[26:26.160 --> 26:32.160]  So there was never any coordinated approach to the city of San Antonio.
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.160]  When we found out of that, we had some reservations,
[26:35.160 --> 26:37.160]  but we were willing at least to listen.
[26:37.160 --> 26:40.160]  But then we started finding out that discussions were happening
[26:40.160 --> 26:43.160]  at other different levels and there was no communication,
[26:43.160 --> 26:45.160]  no coordination between that.
[26:45.160 --> 26:47.160]  We also found out that leases had been negotiated
[26:47.160 --> 26:50.160]  with private business people throughout the city
[26:50.160 --> 26:53.160]  to utilize their vacant buildings
[26:53.160 --> 26:57.160]  without any coordination with the police department
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.160]  because we originally told there were probably going to be a couple of locations
[27:00.160 --> 27:03.160]  and later on we found out there's 12 locations.
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.160]  And yet we were never brought into this at the beginning.
[27:06.160 --> 27:12.160]  Why did the mayor, and I heard this quoted on KTSA,
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.160]  San Antonio 550 station two days ago,
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.160]  I heard it quoted that the mayor said that
[27:19.160 --> 27:23.160]  he didn't appreciate the dishonesty of the Delta Force.
[27:23.160 --> 27:25.160]  I was curious, we call the mayor's office,
[27:25.160 --> 27:28.160]  and Jackie O'Donnell, I believe her name,
[27:28.160 --> 27:31.160]  she told us that you were the mayor's spokesman on this.
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.160]  Can you tell us exactly why the mayor used such strong language
[27:35.160 --> 27:37.160]  and called them dishonest?
[27:37.160 --> 27:39.160]  Well, I think that there were various approaches.
[27:39.160 --> 27:42.160]  For example, when I originally said no several weeks ago,
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.160]  by the fact, a couple of months ago,
[27:44.160 --> 27:48.160]  but no was never no, and then no was never no.
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.160]  End of runs were done around to various community leaders.
[27:51.160 --> 27:55.160]  Excuse me, sir, you're saying that they ignored the police chief
[27:55.160 --> 27:58.160]  and under our constitution, you're the same as the sheriff
[27:58.160 --> 28:00.160]  and you won the city or the county.
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.160]  You're telling me that Delta Force was ignoring your order?
[28:04.160 --> 28:06.160]  Well, I don't want to say they ignored it,
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.160]  but around about way yes, because what they would do,
[28:08.160 --> 28:12.160]  once I said no, they went to various individuals in the community
[28:12.160 --> 28:15.160]  to bring pressure to bear to get me to change my mind.
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.160]  For example, there was a community leader who I have a great deal of respect for
[28:19.160 --> 28:21.160]  and we have a very good relationship that they went to.
[28:21.160 --> 28:23.160]  I get a call from him and he says,
[28:23.160 --> 28:26.160]  chief, there's some people in here that they're in town
[28:26.160 --> 28:29.160]  and was part of their role here, didn't say who it was.
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.160]  They need to meet with the mayor and the police chief.
[28:31.160 --> 28:34.160]  Well, of course, this gentleman, I've worked very closely with him
[28:34.160 --> 28:35.160]  on a number of projects.
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.160]  I said, sure, haven't give me a call.
[28:37.160 --> 28:39.160]  I already said no.
[28:39.160 --> 28:41.160]  Well, then I find out it's the same group.
[28:41.160 --> 28:46.160]  So they identified somebody apparently that I know that's very high in the community
[28:46.160 --> 28:49.160]  to make an approach to me and get me to change my mind.
[28:49.160 --> 28:52.160]  Well, then when we said no,
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.160]  then some elected officials were contacted to bring pressure to bear.
[28:56.160 --> 29:01.160]  And then offers were made to give money, cash money
[29:01.160 --> 29:06.160]  to elected officials' charities if they could get us to change our minds.
[29:06.160 --> 29:08.160]  I mean, you know, as one of my deputy chiefs said,
[29:08.160 --> 29:10.160]  in some circles that's called bribery.
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.160]  Well, it is called bribery, but more importantly,
[29:13.160 --> 29:17.160]  it's called manipulation of the constitutional system
[29:17.160 --> 29:19.160]  and the takeover of local police departments.
[29:19.160 --> 29:23.160]  You talked about a memo from Delta Force?
[29:23.160 --> 29:28.160]  Yeah, because what happened is various elected officials were being contacted.
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.160]  I have 10 city council members and a mayor,
[29:31.160 --> 29:34.160]  and I just wanted to alert them as to what was happening,
[29:34.160 --> 29:38.160]  that these situations were occurring,
[29:38.160 --> 29:41.160]  that they might be contacted by these individuals
[29:41.160 --> 29:44.160]  and that in the best interest of public safety.
[29:44.160 --> 29:46.160]  And that's what I continue to fall back on.
[29:46.160 --> 29:51.160]  We didn't feel that it was in the best interest of the citizens of San Antonio to do that type of thing.
[29:51.160 --> 29:56.160]  All I can say is that, you know, no just never seemed to be no.
[29:56.160 --> 30:00.160]  And even after they told us, we don't need you,
[30:00.160 --> 30:05.160]  we're still going to do our training exercise at other locations in and around the San Antonio,
[30:05.160 --> 30:08.160]  we're still not doing here.
[30:08.160 --> 30:10.160]  Next time, I'm still getting contacted by various officials.
[30:10.160 --> 30:12.160]  I mean, they never would take no for an answer.
[30:12.160 --> 30:14.160]  So they weren't respecting your jurisdiction?
[30:14.160 --> 30:17.160]  They were not respecting our jurisdiction.
[30:17.160 --> 30:25.160]  I don't think they respected our decision to go into predominantly minority areas of the city
[30:25.160 --> 30:27.160]  where we had vacant warehouses and buildings
[30:27.160 --> 30:31.160]  and try to do those types of exercises at those locations in the middle of the night.
[30:31.160 --> 30:33.160]  What type of exercise? Oh, I'm sorry, middle of the night?
[30:33.160 --> 30:36.160]  You know, sometime between 9 p.m. and midnight.
[30:36.160 --> 30:38.160]  You know, I mean, people become frightened.
[30:38.160 --> 30:43.160]  And we do a lot of our decision making on experiences that have happened in a lot of other cities.
[30:43.160 --> 30:46.160]  We were very concerned with some things that have happened over there.
[30:46.160 --> 30:48.160]  We didn't get any real good, clear answers.
[30:48.160 --> 30:50.160]  So that being secretive about it?
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.160]  Very secretive.
[30:51.160 --> 30:56.160]  And you kind of, the city and the mayor and yourself as the police chief,
[30:56.160 --> 31:01.160]  you kind of felt that it was a little odd that they wouldn't trust y'all.
[31:01.160 --> 31:03.160]  I mean, y'all are the authorities here?
[31:03.160 --> 31:04.160]  A little odd.
[31:04.160 --> 31:08.160]  And once I made contact with my peers in some of the other major cities
[31:08.160 --> 31:11.160]  and they shared with me some of their experiences over there,
[31:11.160 --> 31:14.160]  the decision really was very easy.
[31:14.160 --> 31:17.160]  My interest as police chief is the citizens of the city, period.
[31:17.160 --> 31:18.160]  Yes, sir.
[31:18.160 --> 31:21.160]  And I was not about to jeopardize the safety
[31:21.160 --> 31:27.160]  under the exercise of this magnitude under any circumstance.
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.160]  Well, you can't say it any better than that.
[31:29.160 --> 31:32.160]  This isn't some wild conspiracy theorist.
[31:32.160 --> 31:37.160]  This is Alphalepus, head police chief in San Antonio, Texas.
[31:37.160 --> 31:40.160]  Oh, and the mayor too, Howard Peake.
[31:40.160 --> 31:43.160]  He says that it's dangerous and that they're dishonest.
[31:43.160 --> 31:48.160]  I know that they wanted to use some explosives for entry into some of these buildings,
[31:48.160 --> 31:53.160]  some of the so-called ceramic bullets, which would be fired into little traps,
[31:53.160 --> 31:55.160]  which were supposed to catch those, which would disintegrate,
[31:55.160 --> 31:59.160]  supposedly on contact, but I know that in one city, American city,
[31:59.160 --> 32:03.160]  that one of those bullets got a stray and going through a window
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.160]  and down almost into a restaurant.
[32:05.160 --> 32:07.160]  So things can go wrong.
[32:07.160 --> 32:08.160]  What city was that?
[32:08.160 --> 32:10.160]  I believe that it was in Miami.
[32:10.160 --> 32:11.160]  That's incredible.
[32:11.160 --> 32:15.160]  So basically right now, as it stands,
[32:15.160 --> 32:19.160]  until they actually confer with y'all better or change their plans,
[32:19.160 --> 32:21.160]  they're not really welcome to train here in San Antonio?
[32:21.160 --> 32:25.160]  We are not going to support any of their operations.
[32:25.160 --> 32:29.160]  They may do something at the various military bases here in San Antonio.
[32:29.160 --> 32:31.160]  That certainly is their jurisdiction,
[32:31.160 --> 32:34.160]  but we will not support any operations in the city limits.
[32:34.160 --> 32:40.160]  We really count on law enforcement officials locally like y'all to protect the people
[32:40.160 --> 32:43.160]  and uphold the law, and again, I just want to commend you
[32:43.160 --> 32:51.160]  for recognizing some of the behavior of the Delta Force and expelling them.
[32:51.160 --> 32:53.160]  Well, I appreciate that.
[32:53.160 --> 32:57.160]  Again, the decision really was not that difficult.
[32:57.160 --> 32:59.160]  We have the interest of the citizens of San Antonio.
[32:59.160 --> 33:01.160]  This is a military city.
[33:01.160 --> 33:04.160]  We have a tremendous amount of respect for the military and what they do,
[33:04.160 --> 33:08.160]  but I do not have any respect for the tactics that were used
[33:08.160 --> 33:10.160]  by the advanced team coming in here.
[33:10.160 --> 33:12.160]  You're saying that they were disrespectful?
[33:12.160 --> 33:17.160]  They were courteous and friendly to us, to our faces,
[33:17.160 --> 33:22.160]  but again, when you make a decision, you try to get information to go around
[33:22.160 --> 33:26.160]  and try to put influence on you from pressure groups and individuals,
[33:26.160 --> 33:29.160]  either elected or in the community.
[33:29.160 --> 33:34.160]  The interview you just saw was conducted in mid-May of 1998.
[33:34.160 --> 33:37.160]  Delta Force did visit San Antonio.
[33:37.160 --> 33:44.160]  Later the next year, during Operation Last Dance, held February 8th through February 20th.
[33:44.160 --> 33:50.160]  They also smashed into Kingsville, Port Aransas, Alice, Texas, Corpus Christi.
[33:50.160 --> 33:53.160]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and other towns.
[33:53.160 --> 33:55.160]  This is absolutely out of control.
[33:55.160 --> 33:59.160]  We're about to go through this story in sequential order.
[33:59.160 --> 34:03.160]  In some cases, especially in the case of Port Aransas,
[34:03.160 --> 34:09.160]  the local authorities were not even warned before massive military training,
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.160]  if you can call it that, was engaged in, right here in America.
[34:13.160 --> 34:17.160]  It is clear psychological warfare against the police, the public,
[34:17.160 --> 34:23.160]  and everyone else in this nation conditioning us to accept a militarized police state.
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.160]  It's basic terrorism, and I'm sad to say that about our military,
[34:27.160 --> 34:31.160]  but I forgot it's Bill Clinton's military, isn't it?
[34:31.160 --> 34:35.160]  We can only imagine what's coming in the future with other administrations.
[34:35.160 --> 34:38.160]  This is a evil precedent that has been set.
[34:47.160 --> 34:51.160]  On the night of February 8th, 1999, right after my radio show,
[34:51.160 --> 34:57.160]  I got the word that Delta Force had smashed into the first of six towns, Kingsville, Texas.
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.160]  We got in the car, drove through the night to the south Texas coast,
[35:01.160 --> 35:04.160]  right in the middle of Texas oil country.
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.160]  It was incredibly surreal. Shades of Blade Runner.
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.160]  Boy, we can still smell the fire.
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.160]  You fixing this area where it burned through?
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.160]  Hey, how you doing? Alex Jones from Austin, Texas.
[35:29.160 --> 35:31.160]  I got a radio show and a little TV show. What's your name?
[35:31.160 --> 35:34.160]  Jerry McQueen. Jerry McQueen? Yes, sir.
[35:34.160 --> 35:37.160]  So you're fixing the fire damage here?
[35:37.160 --> 35:40.160]  Yes, sir, boarding up the windows and doors.
[35:40.160 --> 35:42.160]  So you're boarding up the windows and doors? Yes, sir.
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.160]  From Army Special Operations Command's work? Yes, sir.
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.160]  Securing it? So that way, no vandalism or anything?
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.160]  You're securing it, so no vandalism.
[35:55.160 --> 35:57.160]  Well, they still care things up.
[35:57.160 --> 35:59.160]  Oh, I understand. No, no, we appreciate what you're doing.
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.160]  Just a few more questions. If you have the time, honestly, you're busy.
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.160]  Did you actually see Army Special Operations Delta Force?
[36:05.160 --> 36:08.160]  I seen some of it. That was it.
[36:08.160 --> 36:10.160]  What color were their uniforms?
[36:10.160 --> 36:13.160]  I don't recall. It was dark and from a distance.
[36:13.160 --> 36:16.160]  From a distance you really couldn't make out their black uniforms very closely?
[36:16.160 --> 36:19.160]  Yeah, it's kind of hard.
[36:19.160 --> 36:22.160]  All different types of helicopters or just mainly one type?
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.160]  Mainly one type that I'd seen.
[36:24.160 --> 36:27.160]  Was that Black Hawk? I'm not sure. I don't know.
[36:27.160 --> 36:29.160]  Larger helicopters?
[36:29.160 --> 36:31.160]  Medium size, I'd say.
[36:31.160 --> 36:34.160]  Medium size.
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.160]  Were the police working with them in these exercises?
[36:39.160 --> 36:41.160]  They had the streets blocked off.
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.160]  Basically, this is a brick building, so the flammable things burned.
[36:46.160 --> 36:49.160]  Yes, just like wood and things like that, I guess.
[36:49.160 --> 36:52.160]  So basically this building is burned out on the inside?
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.160]  Yeah, basically.
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.160]  So it's just things that are charcoal on the inside.
[36:58.160 --> 37:05.160]  Did the military come around here afterwards and clean up all the shell casings and things?
[37:05.160 --> 37:09.160]  Pretty sure they did.
[37:09.160 --> 37:12.160]  Did you hear weapons fire?
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.160]  Yes, we heard machine guns.
[37:14.160 --> 37:16.160]  Or we heard weapons.
[37:16.160 --> 37:18.160]  You heard machine guns and explosions?
[37:18.160 --> 37:20.160]  Yeah, there's explosions.
[37:20.160 --> 37:22.160]  Could you see the explosions or just hear them?
[37:22.160 --> 37:24.160]  You can just hear them.
[37:24.160 --> 37:26.160]  Can you, I know...
[37:26.160 --> 37:27.160]  Oh, yes, sir.
[37:27.160 --> 37:28.160]  We're back to work here.
[37:28.160 --> 37:29.160]  Yes, sir, thanks for your time.
[37:29.160 --> 37:31.160]  All right.
[37:31.160 --> 37:37.160]  Keith, you go around and sign while I keep it diverted and I'll get us some of the fire damage footage.
[37:37.160 --> 37:39.160]  Here it is, sir.
[37:39.160 --> 37:44.160]  Well, you're looking at the upper floor, and our cameraman's a little bit nervous, as you can see,
[37:44.160 --> 37:48.160]  of the Kingsville Police Department's detectives building.
[37:48.160 --> 37:49.160]  Supposedly deserted.
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.160]  We'll go downstairs in just a little while and show you the damage there,
[37:53.160 --> 37:59.160]  and then we'll go interview some folks around the town from just average citizens to officials.
[37:59.160 --> 38:02.160]  Again, why are they practicing taking over police stations?
[38:02.160 --> 38:05.160]  In Kingsville, they did warn some of the officials.
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.160]  In Port Aransas, they did not.
[38:08.160 --> 38:11.160]  Again, we ought to just think about that for a second.
[38:11.160 --> 38:19.160]  Why are they engaging in this behavior to condition the police, as well as the general citizenry,
[38:19.160 --> 38:28.160]  completely burnt out on the second floor of the Kingsville Police Department detectives building?
[38:28.160 --> 38:47.160]  Well, here we have it.
[38:47.160 --> 38:50.160]  They've blown open the door and the ransacking.
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.160]  They've come in and pulled out all the fire damage and put up new plywood over there, as you can see.
[38:56.160 --> 39:03.160]  That's where they came through the windows.
[39:03.160 --> 39:10.160]  Well, here we go for the mark, for the fire damage they've pulled out.
[39:10.160 --> 39:18.160]  Notice the workmen repainting the supposedly abandoned Kingsville Police Department.
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.160]  That doesn't make much sense to me, but again, who knows?
[39:22.160 --> 39:31.160]  I am a conspiracy theorist, but why was it still fully furnished with leather chairs and file cabinets and desk
[39:31.160 --> 39:34.160]  and computer screens and phone systems?
[39:34.160 --> 39:37.160]  You never know. I'm still trying to figure that out.
[39:37.160 --> 39:44.160]  Perhaps they wanted everything left intact so their training and their psychological test would be pulled off a little bit.
[39:44.160 --> 39:47.160]  A little bit cleaner and smoother.
[39:47.160 --> 39:49.160]  Again, you decide.
[39:49.160 --> 39:57.160]  See y'all are just painting over the black burn marks.
[39:57.160 --> 40:05.160]  Delta Force munitions, a solid ceramic slug used to blast open doors.
[40:05.160 --> 40:08.160]  So the jackbooted dogs don't even have to hurt their feet anymore.
[40:08.160 --> 40:10.160]  They just got these.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.160]  Juan Garcia.
[40:11.160 --> 40:15.160]  Juan, what's your position here in the city of Kingsville?
[40:15.160 --> 40:17.160]  Well, I work for Malby Construction.
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.160]  So y'all are just contracted out for the setting to repair?
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.160]  Secure the buildings. That's all. This building and the Exxon building.
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.160]  And that's basically that's it. I mean, that's our only job.
[40:29.160 --> 40:35.160]  So now y'all are here just to secure and put the windows back in and kind of tear out some of the fire damage and things
[40:35.160 --> 40:39.160]  that were caused here to the police station?
[40:39.160 --> 40:42.160]  Yeah, like I said, we were waiting to seal off the building.
[40:42.160 --> 40:50.160]  So that's all they told us. Basically they told us we were going to be sealing off a building late at night.
[40:50.160 --> 40:51.160]  And that's all.
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.160]  After it was broken into.
[40:53.160 --> 40:56.160]  Did you see what happened?
[40:56.160 --> 41:00.160]  We saw we heard gunfire and small explosions and stuff.
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.160]  But actually what happened though, the helicopters zooming around.
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.160]  Can you tell us what you saw and heard?
[41:07.160 --> 41:13.160]  Basically what I saw was just helicopters flying around and gunfire and explosions.
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.160]  But the police were all there and they told us don't be calm.
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.160]  This is just an exercise.
[41:18.160 --> 41:22.160]  Just be calm and were the police working with the military?
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.160]  Yes, sir, they were. As far as I know.
[41:25.160 --> 41:30.160]  I mean, because they sealed off the streets and pretty much in a hurry.
[41:30.160 --> 41:32.160]  Have y'all fixed any bullet holes inside?
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.160]  No, sir. We're not doing it. All we're doing is the exterior of the building.
[41:36.160 --> 41:38.160]  Was there bullet holes inside?
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.160]  Yeah, we saw some.
[41:41.160 --> 41:46.160]  You couldn't hear very much because there was a lot of noise, choppers and stuff.
[41:46.160 --> 41:48.160]  How many choppers?
[41:48.160 --> 41:55.160]  I can't recall. I would say like six. I didn't count them. There were small ones and big ones.
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.160]  Oh, small ones and big ones. We were told there were actually some attack Apache type aircraft.
[42:00.160 --> 42:05.160]  And then also some Blackhawks in support that were actually delivering the troops.
[42:05.160 --> 42:08.160]  I guess, I mean, like I said, I don't know the difference between the helicopters,
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.160]  but there were several big ones and some small ones and stuff.
[42:12.160 --> 42:18.160]  So you saw several big ones and some small ones. Can you try to give us a ballpark figure?
[42:18.160 --> 42:23.160]  I would say five, six. Somewhere on there.
[42:23.160 --> 42:26.160]  So two or three small ones and two or three big ones?
[42:26.160 --> 42:29.160]  Yeah, there wasn't very many big ones. I think there was only like two big ones.
[42:29.160 --> 42:31.160]  And then the rest were just small.
[42:31.160 --> 42:34.160]  So two large helicopters and four small helicopters?
[42:34.160 --> 42:36.160]  Right. Just Black. Just Black.
[42:36.160 --> 42:37.160]  Black helicopters.
[42:37.160 --> 42:38.160]  Yes, sir.
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.160]  And you couldn't see any markings? Were there lights on the helicopters?
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.160]  No, sir. Not when I saw them. Not at all.
[42:43.160 --> 42:45.160]  And how low were they?
[42:45.160 --> 42:50.160]  Right above the buildings. You know, real low.
[42:50.160 --> 42:51.160]  Real low?
[42:51.160 --> 42:52.160]  Yeah.
[42:52.160 --> 42:53.160]  And that's incredibly dangerous.
[42:53.160 --> 42:54.160]  Your name?
[42:54.160 --> 42:55.160]  Gracie.
[42:55.160 --> 42:56.160]  Gracie?
[42:56.160 --> 42:57.160]  Uh-huh.
[42:57.160 --> 42:58.160]  Gracie, you live here in Kingsville?
[42:58.160 --> 43:02.160]  Yes, sir. I live in that building right there in Casa Ricardo.
[43:02.160 --> 43:05.160]  Wow. You live real close.
[43:05.160 --> 43:10.160]  Did you hear about the helicopter assaults on the old police station before it happened?
[43:10.160 --> 43:16.160]  No, no, no. Until that day, there were all these people over there and right there.
[43:16.160 --> 43:17.160]  I'm sorry.
[43:17.160 --> 43:18.160]  No, no.
[43:18.160 --> 43:22.160]  And all that time, you know, there'd be no, you know, surroundings like that.
[43:22.160 --> 43:26.160]  And basically, were you at home when you heard the explosions?
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.160]  Well, for a matter of fact, I have gone for a walk.
[43:30.160 --> 43:32.160]  And I sit and then when I got here...
[43:32.160 --> 43:34.160]  It's a poor thing. You were actually out here.
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.160]  I sit on the bench and then I got scared because, you know, because of the noise.
[43:38.160 --> 43:41.160]  It was so terrible and too loud, you know.
[43:41.160 --> 43:43.160]  What'd you see? What'd you hear?
[43:43.160 --> 43:49.160]  Well, there were throwing some bombs, you know, bombing.
[43:49.160 --> 43:50.160]  Right?
[43:50.160 --> 43:51.160]  Yeah. And some...
[43:51.160 --> 43:53.160]  I think they were using some rifles, too.
[43:53.160 --> 43:57.160]  And the other kind of rifles, you know, the one, you know, stuff like that.
[43:57.160 --> 44:09.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, Gracie lives in Casa Ricardo, approximately 250 feet from the Kingsville Detectives Building, the police department.
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.160]  Casa Ricardo is a nursing home, an old folks home.
[44:14.160 --> 44:21.160]  This lady's out for a walk and suddenly black helicopters, men in uniforms running around firing automatic weapons.
[44:21.160 --> 44:27.160]  Now, tell me, that is not pure insanity and total disregard for the public safety.
[44:27.160 --> 44:29.160]  Let's continue with the interview.
[44:29.160 --> 44:37.160]  Just, you know, going back and forth and doing the same thing, you know, but I just couldn't see anything else because I was so scared.
[44:37.160 --> 44:39.160]  I went back to my apartment and, you know...
[44:39.160 --> 44:41.160]  So, you were out walking and you actually...
[44:41.160 --> 44:46.160]  Well, I think you started when I got from my walk. I'm not really too sure.
[44:46.160 --> 44:47.160]  What'd you see in here again?
[44:47.160 --> 44:48.160]  Uh-huh.
[44:48.160 --> 44:51.160]  You were saying...
[44:51.160 --> 44:58.160]  I went back to my apartment because I was so scared and I got out of it from there because I could still hear the noise, you know.
[44:58.160 --> 45:00.160]  It was too loud and too fast.
[45:00.160 --> 45:01.160]  Make the noise, guys.
[45:01.160 --> 45:02.160]  How about about about an hour?
[45:02.160 --> 45:04.160]  Yeah, of everything, you know.
[45:04.160 --> 45:06.160]  I think they were doing everything at the same time.
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.160]  Explosions and firing and everything at the same time.
[45:10.160 --> 45:14.160]  And then I saw one getting down from a parachute and away over there.
[45:14.160 --> 45:15.160]  You're kidding.
[45:15.160 --> 45:17.160]  Yes, I did.
[45:17.160 --> 45:19.160]  What kind of uniforms were they?
[45:19.160 --> 45:21.160]  I couldn't barely tell.
[45:21.160 --> 45:23.160]  You couldn't really see them in the dark?
[45:23.160 --> 45:25.160]  Yeah, yeah, it was dark, so it was no...
[45:25.160 --> 45:27.160]  Well, maybe it's, you know...
[45:27.160 --> 45:28.160]  Black uniforms?
[45:28.160 --> 45:30.160]  Or green or something like that, you know.
[45:30.160 --> 45:32.160]  Like the ones that...
[45:32.160 --> 45:36.160]  Do you have the men from the National Garden?
[45:36.160 --> 45:38.160]  I think they're the same.
[45:38.160 --> 45:45.160]  I couldn't barely tell and I couldn't barely tell if there was wearing, you know, something like that, like his or I really couldn't tell.
[45:45.160 --> 45:46.160]  But I saw one.
[45:46.160 --> 45:48.160]  What about the helicopters?
[45:48.160 --> 45:51.160]  Well, the helicopters, I don't know.
[45:51.160 --> 45:55.160]  I haven't seen them, you know, so close.
[45:55.160 --> 45:58.160]  They were so big and, you know...
[45:58.160 --> 45:59.160]  They looked like...
[45:59.160 --> 46:01.160]  Well, they looked like blacks.
[46:01.160 --> 46:02.160]  I couldn't barely tell.
[46:02.160 --> 46:03.160]  Maybe they were black.
[46:03.160 --> 46:04.160]  I don't know.
[46:04.160 --> 46:06.160]  No flashing lights on them or anything?
[46:06.160 --> 46:08.160]  I'm afraid they weren't.
[46:08.160 --> 46:09.160]  Between...
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.160]  It was seven to nine in the evening.
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.160]  Seven to nine.
[46:14.160 --> 46:16.160]  And it's also, it was a fire.
[46:16.160 --> 46:17.160]  I don't know where.
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.160]  I think it was in that building.
[46:19.160 --> 46:20.160]  They've all painted over it.
[46:20.160 --> 46:21.160]  Yeah.
[46:21.160 --> 46:23.160]  Wasn't it all black this morning?
[46:23.160 --> 46:27.160]  Yeah, you know, these days like that, I think they fixed it up.
[46:27.160 --> 46:33.160]  But I couldn't tell if it was, you know, right there or over there.
[46:33.160 --> 46:34.160]  So I guess...
[46:34.160 --> 46:35.160]  Now, wait, wait.
[46:35.160 --> 46:37.160]  You said you saw somebody with a parachute.
[46:37.160 --> 46:39.160]  Can you point the direction where you saw the guy in the parachute?
[46:39.160 --> 46:43.160]  Well, let's see...
[46:43.160 --> 46:46.160]  Like near the fence, way over there.
[46:46.160 --> 46:47.160]  Way a couple hundred yards over there?
[46:47.160 --> 46:48.160]  Yeah.
[46:48.160 --> 46:50.160]  And when they're coming down from ropes or actual parachutes?
[46:50.160 --> 46:52.160]  Well, I couldn't barely tell.
[46:52.160 --> 46:53.160]  They were just coming out of the sky in the dark.
[46:53.160 --> 46:55.160]  I couldn't tell if it was a parachute or if it was a rope.
[46:55.160 --> 46:57.160]  I just saw him, you know, getting down.
[46:57.160 --> 46:58.160]  That's all.
[46:58.160 --> 47:00.160]  That is just absolutely incredible.
[47:00.160 --> 47:02.160]  How long did it last?
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.160]  Oh, I don't know.
[47:05.160 --> 47:10.160]  You mean when they, you know, you mean when they finished the end?
[47:10.160 --> 47:11.160]  I'm not sure.
[47:11.160 --> 47:13.160]  It's like I said, it was 7 to 9.
[47:13.160 --> 47:15.160]  That's what they told me there.
[47:15.160 --> 47:17.160]  I'm not sure.
[47:17.160 --> 47:19.160]  And so it went on for several hours?
[47:19.160 --> 47:20.160]  Yeah, I'm afraid so.
[47:20.160 --> 47:21.160]  The gunfire and all the rest of it?
[47:21.160 --> 47:22.160]  Yeah.
[47:22.160 --> 47:24.160]  Well, they had trouble with their imaginary enemy, didn't they?
[47:24.160 --> 47:25.160]  I guess.
[47:25.160 --> 47:27.160]  Must have been many different teams.
[47:27.160 --> 47:31.160]  There were using so many things that I couldn't barely tell what they were.
[47:31.160 --> 47:34.160]  So there were explosions and rapid gunfire?
[47:34.160 --> 47:35.160]  Uh-huh.
[47:35.160 --> 47:38.160]  And they also stuffed them the top of the building right there?
[47:38.160 --> 47:39.160]  Which one?
[47:39.160 --> 47:41.160]  That one right there, you know?
[47:41.160 --> 47:43.160]  You're talking about the old Exxon building?
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.160]  Yeah, that one right here.
[47:45.160 --> 47:47.160]  They blew out almost every window of that building?
[47:47.160 --> 47:48.160]  Yeah, that's what I...
[47:48.160 --> 47:50.160]  We heard that large helicopters landed on the top?
[47:50.160 --> 47:51.160]  Yes.
[47:51.160 --> 47:53.160]  Mostly all of them, I think.
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.160]  They stopped right there in that building on the top.
[47:57.160 --> 47:59.160]  They just landed on top of the building?
[47:59.160 --> 48:01.160]  Yeah, and then they got away.
[48:01.160 --> 48:03.160]  They flew away.
[48:03.160 --> 48:08.160]  And I also saw a lot of men, you know, I think they were going up and those things, you know.
[48:08.160 --> 48:10.160]  What about the police?
[48:10.160 --> 48:13.160]  Well, the police, I don't know about them.
[48:13.160 --> 48:14.160]  I don't know what they did.
[48:14.160 --> 48:17.160]  They were just taking care of the area, that's all.
[48:17.160 --> 48:19.160]  While the Delta Force did their work?
[48:19.160 --> 48:25.160]  They were standing right there, and I went over there, and over here, there were a whole bunch of them.
[48:25.160 --> 48:26.160]  I think there were...
[48:26.160 --> 48:29.160]  Did you appreciate not being warned and suddenly having black helicopters swarming?
[48:29.160 --> 48:30.160]  No.
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.160]  You didn't enjoy that?
[48:32.160 --> 48:43.160]  No, no, not really, because, you know, I was thinking myself that they should be, you know, have done that here because it's dangerous, you know.
[48:43.160 --> 48:44.160]  Well, you know what they're doing.
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.160]  They want to do this to citizens in the future, martial law, and I don't want to scare you as being prepared in this country.
[48:49.160 --> 48:55.160]  And what they're trying to do is, have you ever noticed how if you get somebody into something a little bit at a time, they're ready to accept it?
[48:55.160 --> 49:01.160]  They're easing America in to where people are used to seeing black helicopters flying over and explosions.
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.160]  I don't know, I don't know what to say about that.
[49:05.160 --> 49:07.160]  Well, I'm not trying to scare you, they're not coming after you.
[49:07.160 --> 49:08.160]  Yeah, that's right.
[49:08.160 --> 49:09.160]  Don't worry, they're coming after me.
[49:09.160 --> 49:10.160]  Even though they are, maybe the others, they are.
[49:10.160 --> 49:13.160]  They said a war coward is coming this way, so I don't know.
[49:13.160 --> 49:19.160]  Maybe, you know, they just wanted us to know, to see how, you know, how they fight in the war.
[49:19.160 --> 49:21.160]  That's what I've been thinking about.
[49:21.160 --> 49:23.160]  You're right, they want you to know that they're ready.
[49:23.160 --> 49:33.160]  And maybe, you know, if that war comes over here, that war, you know, it probably will be more louder and stronger, you know?
[49:33.160 --> 49:34.160]  And again, your name one more time?
[49:34.160 --> 49:36.160]  Gracie Longoria.
[49:36.160 --> 49:37.160]  Gracie Longoria?
[49:37.160 --> 49:38.160]  From here, from Kinsville.
[49:38.160 --> 49:40.160]  Well, God bless you, and we appreciate you taking time.
[49:40.160 --> 49:41.160]  Well, God bless you too.
[49:41.160 --> 49:46.160]  Right here in Kingsville, Texas, every window in the Exxon building has been smashed out.
[49:46.160 --> 49:53.160]  Every single window, and they've come in and boarded up every single one of them.
[49:53.160 --> 49:54.160]  This is from the explosions.
[49:54.160 --> 50:04.160]  They came and blew a hole in the roof, we're told, and the large helicopters landed here, again, at the Exxon administrative building that's been shut down for some time.
[50:04.160 --> 50:16.160]  They blew a hole in the roof and inserted troops inside, and practiced killing the evil terrorist, and the police, again, were nearby helping as the relationship was growing.
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.160]  It's so much fun.
[50:20.160 --> 50:29.160]  Well, the entire front entrance that we're told was glass and metal by the lady across the street who will not speak on camera from the Kingsville Publishing Company,
[50:29.160 --> 50:37.160]  the local newspaper, the Kingsville Record, says that, yes, this was all metal, trimmed glass windows, and the entrance right here will all blown away.
[50:37.160 --> 50:41.160]  Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise.
[50:41.160 --> 50:42.160]  That's ridiculous.
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.160]  They blew out every window in the structure.
[50:45.160 --> 50:47.160]  Look at it.
[50:47.160 --> 50:48.160]  Must have been some powerful explosives.
[50:48.160 --> 50:53.160]  I'd like to see the inside of this building.
[50:53.160 --> 51:01.160]  And again, you got the newspaper right across the street, won't even talk to us.
[51:01.160 --> 51:04.160]  About the reporter that allegedly had his camera stolen.
[51:04.160 --> 51:05.160]  Judy Hayes.
[51:05.160 --> 51:06.160]  Judy Hayes, Alex Jones.
[51:06.160 --> 51:07.160]  Nice to meet you.
[51:07.160 --> 51:08.160]  Yes, sir.
[51:08.160 --> 51:09.160]  What's your position here?
[51:09.160 --> 51:11.160]  I'm the lieutenant in charge of the patrol division.
[51:11.160 --> 51:12.160]  Oh, fantastic.
[51:12.160 --> 51:16.160]  All I want is like a five or ten minute interview, so everybody can sit down.
[51:16.160 --> 51:20.160]  I'll answer a couple of questions for you, and then I have to be on my way out.
[51:20.160 --> 51:24.160]  I understand everybody's busy, and I appreciate you doing this.
[51:24.160 --> 51:26.160]  Can you say your name for the record and spell it?
[51:26.160 --> 51:30.160]  My name is Judy Hayes, J-U-D-Y-H-A-Y-E-S.
[51:30.160 --> 51:31.160]  Thanks a lot.
[51:31.160 --> 51:34.160]  We also make documentaries, by the way.
[51:34.160 --> 51:46.160]  We're told that Monday evening of this week, there was a Delta Force operation from Fort Bragg,
[51:46.160 --> 51:51.160]  otherwise known as Army Special Operations Command.
[51:51.160 --> 51:54.160]  Can you tell us how many helicopters were involved?
[51:54.160 --> 51:59.160]  I can tell you that Monday night, there was a joint training session between the United States Army
[51:59.160 --> 52:01.160]  and the Kingsville Police Department.
[52:01.160 --> 52:05.160]  The Army was doing some sort of extraction type thing.
[52:05.160 --> 52:07.160]  They used eight helicopters.
[52:07.160 --> 52:16.160]  Our training involved sealing off the area as if we were involved in taking care of a hazardous materials incident.
[52:16.160 --> 52:23.160]  So we were rerouting traffic and making sure that there was no civilian foot traffic in the area.
[52:23.160 --> 52:26.160]  So we got quite a bit of training in that area.
[52:26.160 --> 52:31.160]  Did any of your SWAT team, or I see you have two officers look like they're SWAT trained,
[52:31.160 --> 52:34.160]  did they assist the Delta Force in any way?
[52:34.160 --> 52:41.160]  The only participation on the part of the Kingsville Police Department was in a hazardous materials training session.
[52:41.160 --> 52:45.160]  We did not participate in any way with what the Army was doing.
[52:45.160 --> 52:46.160]  That's very helpful.
[52:46.160 --> 52:50.160]  We're also told that they were firing ceramic bullets.
[52:50.160 --> 52:53.160]  I have no idea about anything that the Army was doing.
[52:53.160 --> 52:56.160]  It would be a situation in which you would need to contact them.
[52:56.160 --> 53:01.160]  Well, yes, in Fort Bragg.
[53:01.160 --> 53:06.160]  Now, the Mayor had stated, or his office had stated that it was secret,
[53:06.160 --> 53:10.160]  but what y'all are saying is it was secret up to a point and then the Police Department went around
[53:10.160 --> 53:13.160]  and actually warned the citizens in the immediate area downtown.
[53:13.160 --> 53:18.160]  I have no idea where the word secret came from and I'm not going to respond to that.
[53:18.160 --> 53:25.160]  All I can tell you is that we did plan with the Army on this in order to get our training for hazardous materials
[53:25.160 --> 53:32.160]  and we did warn as many persons as possible in the immediate area and then moving out until we had to take our positions
[53:32.160 --> 53:35.160]  in order to take care of the traffic flow.
[53:35.160 --> 53:42.160]  So actually, the night of the event, several hours previous to the eight helicopters coming in,
[53:42.160 --> 53:47.160]  y'all did warn the general public in the area?
[53:47.160 --> 53:49.160]  We most certainly did.
[53:49.160 --> 53:53.160]  Are you familiar with the Chief Police of San Antonio, Alley Fetalpus?
[53:53.160 --> 53:54.160]  No, I'm not.
[53:54.160 --> 53:58.160]  The Deputy Chief is and we're told the Chief also knows him.
[53:58.160 --> 54:05.160]  I went down and did a breaking story back in May of 1998 where he threw out the Delta Force and I had him on tape.
[54:05.160 --> 54:08.160]  They attempted to bribe him. They endangered public safety.
[54:08.160 --> 54:13.160]  Many areas have let Delta train, but are you aware that in Miami they fired a bullet into an all night restaurant?
[54:13.160 --> 54:21.160]  I haven't got any idea of what you're talking about at all and that includes any operations by any one of that name.
[54:21.160 --> 54:23.160]  I know that we worked with the Army.
[54:23.160 --> 54:25.160]  Yes, Delta Force.
[54:25.160 --> 54:34.160]  Are you aware that it is highly dangerous to have helicopters at those low levels, especially that many in a small area?
[54:34.160 --> 54:40.160]  I think what you need to do is to talk to people who have training in that area and I would again refer you to the Army.
[54:40.160 --> 54:44.160]  Okay, one of my last questions and I do appreciate your time.
[54:44.160 --> 54:52.160]  Was there any money given to the city by the U.S. government to be able to carry out this exercise?
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.160]  I think you would need to talk to our finance director on that.
[54:55.160 --> 55:02.160]  Because the chief police of San Antonio and the mayor talked about, again, the attempted bribery and the cash money gifts to people and things.
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.160]  That's why it really became a big stink. It was in their paper for quite a long time.
[55:07.160 --> 55:15.160]  I can't comment on that kind of thing. I'd have no knowledge of it whatsoever and I've referred you to who you need to talk to.
[55:15.160 --> 55:21.160]  Hi, my name is Alex Jones from KGFK Radio and Austin also had a little TV show.
[55:21.160 --> 55:23.160]  How are you doing?
[55:23.160 --> 55:25.160]  Is the mayor in today?
[55:25.160 --> 55:29.160]  I'm not sure. You may want to check his office. Is it straight in?
[55:41.160 --> 55:44.160]  Is this the mayor's office? The city manager's office.
[55:44.160 --> 55:45.160]  City manager's office.
[55:45.160 --> 55:46.160]  Is he in?
[55:46.160 --> 55:48.160]  Yeah, he is. He's on the phone right now.
[55:48.160 --> 55:51.160]  I'd like to ask him two or three questions.
[55:51.160 --> 55:54.160]  What's your name again, sir? Carlos Larimer.
[55:54.160 --> 55:55.160]  Carlos Larimer?
[55:55.160 --> 55:56.160]  Yeah.
[55:56.160 --> 55:57.160]  Well, it's good to meet you, city manager.
[55:57.160 --> 55:59.160]  We'd just like to ask you some simple questions.
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.160]  I hope you don't mind if I sit down. I'm very tired.
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.160]  I've been walking around talking to people on the street all day.
[56:05.160 --> 56:12.160]  We're just curious about Army Special Operations from Fort Bragg coming here, Delta Force.
[56:12.160 --> 56:19.160]  And we'd like just basically to ask some questions about was the public informed beforehand?
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.160]  Are you all aware of the 10th Amendment and Posse Commentatus and things like that?
[56:24.160 --> 56:30.160]  No, I'm probably not aware of the 10th Amendment, but I made the decision not to inform the public
[56:30.160 --> 56:35.160]  because we would have had thousands of people around this area here and would have been a lot harder to control.
[56:35.160 --> 56:39.160]  I understand, sir. I wasn't trying to be sarcastic when I said it.
[56:39.160 --> 56:41.160]  I didn't think you were. I didn't think you were.
[56:41.160 --> 56:44.160]  Yeah. Well, I mean, certainly you are aware of the 10th Amendment, though.
[56:44.160 --> 56:51.160]  It states rights. And it's also Posse Commentatus is concerning federal troops.
[56:51.160 --> 56:56.160]  Working with local law enforcement in any area is expressly prohibited.
[56:56.160 --> 56:58.160]  And I'm not accusing you of doing something wrong.
[56:58.160 --> 57:01.160]  This has been done in literally hundreds of communities.
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.160]  I don't know if they told you that you were the first when they came here.
[57:06.160 --> 57:12.160]  I mean, I was the first of some current events or current exercises that they're going to have.
[57:12.160 --> 57:18.160]  But you chose just so it wouldn't be a public health risk, just so it wouldn't endanger the public,
[57:18.160 --> 57:21.160]  to not tell the public about the operation that was held here Monday.
[57:21.160 --> 57:22.160]  That's right.
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.160]  We were told at a local grocery store some people thought the bank was being robbed.
[57:26.160 --> 57:29.160]  Well, the bank is very close to here, you know.
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.160]  But the police were fully informed of it.
[57:33.160 --> 57:44.160]  As a matter of fact, they used an exercise to secure an area where we might have a hazardous material escape,
[57:44.160 --> 57:47.160]  like from a railroad tracks.
[57:47.160 --> 57:53.160]  We have trains that carry some materials that could be hazardous to you,
[57:53.160 --> 57:56.160]  and sometimes a hazardous or an accident on the bypass.
[57:56.160 --> 57:59.160]  So they practiced an exercise to secure an area.
[57:59.160 --> 58:01.160]  Oh, so local law enforcement actually worked with them?
[58:01.160 --> 58:03.160]  Yeah.
[58:03.160 --> 58:06.160]  Actually worked with Special Forces.
[58:06.160 --> 58:08.160]  Special Forces from Fort Bragg?
[58:08.160 --> 58:09.160]  Yeah.
[58:09.160 --> 58:10.160]  Delta Force?
[58:10.160 --> 58:11.160]  Yeah.
[58:11.160 --> 58:17.160]  Looking at your window, seeing unmarked helicopters and troops dressed in ninja black suits with assault rifles,
[58:17.160 --> 58:19.160]  it's kind of spooky.
[58:19.160 --> 58:25.160]  Well, I agree with Mr. Sanchez, head of emergency management in Clyberg County and in the city of Kingsville.
[58:25.160 --> 58:32.160]  And he wasn't warned, neither was the county commissioner's court or the county judge about what happened in Kingsville.
[58:32.160 --> 58:36.160]  Four days later, in part of Operation Last Dance,
[58:36.160 --> 58:41.160]  Port Aransas got a little visit, and the mayor, Mayor Glenn Martin, was not pleased.
[58:41.160 --> 58:45.160]  Nobody wants to get in their business, but we ought to be able to answer questions,
[58:45.160 --> 58:52.160]  especially when they're flying at dangerously low levels and alert the citizenry.
[58:52.160 --> 58:58.160]  We contacted the mayor of Port Aransas, and in the Corpus Christi collar times,
[58:58.160 --> 59:03.160]  he was also quoted as saying he was not warned of the impending raid.
[59:03.160 --> 59:08.160]  It can be termed nothing less than actual terrorism against the American people.
[59:08.160 --> 59:15.160]  By definition, terrorism seeks a political aim by scaring a population or a group of people.
[59:15.160 --> 59:18.160]  It's plain for all thinking people to see.
[59:18.160 --> 59:26.160]  America is in the process of a radical change, and I'm afraid to say it's not for the better.
[59:26.160 --> 59:30.160]  Alice, Texas, was next on the list for Delta Force training,
[59:30.160 --> 59:37.160]  and one of my listeners in my radio program dropped by and talked to the police chief of Alice, Jack D. Compton.
[59:37.160 --> 59:40.160]  What he found out was interesting.
[59:40.160 --> 59:45.160]  A very key piece of information came out.
[59:45.160 --> 59:51.160]  Foreign troops were involved in at least the Alice operation.
[59:51.160 --> 1:00:00.160]  You see, Jack D. Compton's comments didn't make much sense until about a month after Operation Last Dance,
[1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:07.160]  when Aniston, Alabama, got a visitation by 800 rangers accompanied by Russians.
[1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:13.160]  You'll find out later they actually turned the power off to part of the city because they felt like it.
[1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:16.160]  But let's go ahead and talk to the chief.
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:20.160]  Then we'll go and show you where Delta engaged in so of its training.
[1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:32.160]  Literally 100 feet from a backyard where children were at play.
[1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:44.160]  They need these trainings so specialized and what exactly the qualifications are that they need to change so much.
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:51.160]  They need to keep their skills at hold the razor blades they have to.
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:58.160]  They don't have time to look at their time to plan an operation and go in.
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:02.160]  They've got to make a move, make it fast.
[1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:09.160]  Time is of the essence and having their skills up to a high level is very important.
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:14.160]  But these are the people that you're going to call on bringing your terrorist activities.
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:15.160]  But who are the terrorists?
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:22.160]  It's certainly not Bill Clinton giving all of our nuclear weapons designs and enabling systems to the Chai comms.
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:29.160]  No, no, no, it's people like the Davidians or Randy and Vicki Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:40.160]  We're the terrorists. We're the danger. We're the threat because we won't submit to total domination, total control, total slavery.
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:46.160]  Waco is a sterling example of this, the lies and corruption that were evidenced during their activities.
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:54.160]  But I forgot we had to save the children. That's why we burned the 17 little children to death.
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:02:00.160]  Again, to save them from the terrorist, the deadly dangerous terrorist, their parents.
[1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:08.160]  Can you tell us some of the, not necessarily some of the specifics, but some of the just certain reasons why, you know,
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:14.160]  they need these trainings so specialized and what exactly the qualifications are that they need to change so much.
[1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:19.160]  So if there's not any terrorist activity, these are going to be the men that address it.
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:26.160]  And they need to keep their skills at home the greater than they have to.
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:33.160]  And they don't have time to look at their time to plan an operation and go in.
[1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:37.160]  You know, I can't plan it forever. We've got to make it move fast.
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:44.160]  Towers are the essence and they're having their skills up to a high level.
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:49.160]  But these are the people that you don't call them, bring your terrorist activities.
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:53.160]  Well, yes, these are the people we're going to call on for terrorist activities.
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:59.160]  Delta Force, BATF, FBI, hostage rescue teams.
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:02.160]  They're training on military bases as we speak, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:09.160]  They trained back in 93 before the assault on the Waco Church. That's right. It's not a compound.
[1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:16.160]  We need to get our priorities straight in this country and worry about our real national security risk,
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:23.160]  the real threats to our nation, like Bill Clinton, and the already forming global government that controls him.
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:30.160]  That's the crisis. That's the threat. Not our nation's people. Not America.
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:36.160]  Speaking of global government, let's go back and hear from Chief Police in Alice, Texas, Jack D. Compton.
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:42.160]  As he admits, foreign troops were on the ground during the training mission in Alice, Texas,
[1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:47.160]  during the terror mission in Alice, Texas. Make no mistake, that's what it's about.
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:56.160]  Again, training police, training the general public, training the military that working together for national security is a wonderful thing.
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:01.160]  I'm here to tell you, historically speaking, it is nothing less than a nightmare.
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:06.160]  Governments are the most dangerous creations on earth that are man-made.
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:12.160]  We've also learned that citizens in Alice were told that if they came outside their yards during the training exercise,
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:21.160]  they'd be taken to jail. I mean, this is getting more and more insane. The Bill of Rights is being flushed down the tubes.
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:26.160]  This government is training other so-called friendly countries? They are training friendly countries,
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:32.160]  and I'm not oblivious to giving their names, but I know that they are.
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:39.160]  They were there in Alice a couple weeks ago. They were so present, yes.
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:45.160]  They weren't involved in the training itself. They were there from the sidelines.
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:52.160]  Well, you just heard it, a police chief in a South Texas town, Jack D. Compton, saying that he's under liberty to discuss information,
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:05:00.160]  engage in supposed national security operations. What a convenient umbrella for the unfolding police state.
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:08.160]  But there's one problem with that whole argument. Why are foreign troops in almost all of these exercises, according to my sources?
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:17.160]  Why are they allowed to see all this secret activity? But the American people, in many cases, aren't even warned in the name of national security,
[1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:23.160]  because people like Walter Zulskowski, spokesperson for Army Special Operations at Fort Bragg,
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:29.160]  has stated many times in many publications that, well, we can't let the public know because we have to protect our tactics.
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:36.160]  Oh, I see. The foreign troops aren't your enemy. You just got to protect your tactics from your enemy, and that's obviously the American people.
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:40.160]  Can you describe how many and describe also the helicopters that were there?
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:52.160]  Well, the helicopters were blackhawks, and they came in black down. We didn't see them except in the skyline, and they were completely dark.
[1:05:52.160 --> 1:06:07.160]  And some of the Delta Force people repelled down the ropes to the helicopter, I mean, from the helicopter to the top of the building.
[1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:11.160]  So some landed there on the ground in the parking lot in this building.
[1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:15.160]  Was there any that hovered like above the building, and if so, how high?
[1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:23.160]  Only low enough. Oh, they was probably around 75 to 100 feet, but they came down on the ropes.
[1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:31.160]  And so once they injected the helicopters left, they came back in a few minutes and picked them up.
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:37.160]  They didn't go back up the ropes, they would pick up the helicopters on the ground.
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:50.160]  The noise level was not excessive. Inside that brick building, the noises were muffled.
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:58.160]  You didn't hear a great deal. And the loudest noises didn't come from explosives.
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:07.160]  I think what we call flashbangs, that's a distraction device that makes an excessive noise and a very bright flash.
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:13.160]  The charges they used to breach doors, they were just enough to breach the door.
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:19.160]  They were just coming and dropping off people and bombing and shooting their guns.
[1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:21.160]  They had guns?
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:25.160]  Yeah, they were just practicing. They had closed up all the roads and everything.
[1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:29.160]  Did you see any men? What kind of uniforms they had on?
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:37.160]  No, they didn't let us get out of our gates because if we did, they said we would be arrested.
[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:40.160]  Did you see the Alice Police Department there?
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:42.160]  Yeah, they had all the roads blocked.
[1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:44.160]  So they were like working together?
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:48.160]  Yeah, they were in the sheriff's office.
[1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:57.160]  The J.E. Poultry Company, an abandoned poultry plant, was the site of Delta Force training in Alice, Texas.
[1:07:57.160 --> 1:08:01.160]  Literally smack dab in the middle of a residential area.
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:04.160]  As I said, where children were at play.
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:08.160]  You know, I wish I could say that these operations were just a blunder,
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:14.160]  an irresponsible activity on part of the Department of Defense.
[1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:18.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's clear it's being done on purpose.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.160]  And don't forget Gracie. She lives in Casa Ricardo,
[1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:37.160]  a retirement home that was right across the street from the detectives building,
[1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:39.160]  the old detectives building in Kingsville,
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:46.160]  old folks homes, residential areas, all part of training the American people and police
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:54.160]  to accept visitations by black helicopters bearing armed men in black ski masks with automatic weapons.
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:59.160]  Again, Americans are being designated as the new threat.
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:04.160]  Not the Chycoms, not the Russians, not the socialists that are running this nation.
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:07.160]  They've taken over, my friends.
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:13.160]  Unfortunately, the strange military activities are not localized only in Texas.
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:17.160]  They're happening all across the nation and with increased frequency,
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:23.160]  literally hundreds of so-called training missions terrorizing the public.
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:27.160]  You heard the police chief of Alice, Texas tell us that,
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:31.160]  well, there were some foreign troops, but I can't talk about it.
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:37.160]  Well, the sheriff, Larry Ameshin, sure talked about it from Aniston, Alabama.
[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:41.160]  He wasn't told that 800 Rangers with a contingent of Russian troops
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:45.160]  were going to be visiting the Aniston Municipal Airport.
[1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:49.160]  They didn't even warn the public when they turned the power off,
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:52.160]  not by accident, but on purpose.
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:57.160]  Again, if this doesn't make it clear that this is out of control psychological warfare
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:04.160]  upon the American people, psyops testing, I don't know what will make it clear to you, America.
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:08.160]  This is a crisis of pandemic proportions.
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:14.160]  Imagine sitting down to have dinner and suddenly the power goes off at 9 o'clock at night.
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:17.160]  A few minutes later, you hear automatic weapons fire.
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:20.160]  You walk outside, black helicopters, structures on fire.
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:26.160]  That's what happened at the Aniston Municipal Airport back in March of 1999.
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:30.160]  And again, the sheriff was not even notified, Larry Ameshin.
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:35.160]  But our good friends, the Russians, oh, it was okay to tell them all about it.
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:42.160]  And they were even allowed to join in on the fun, the terrorizing of the American public.
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:44.160]  Thank you, Bill Clinton.
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.160]  Lest you think it's just special operations from the Army and the Navy
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:51.160]  that have been engaging in this treacherous activity, think twice.
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:59.160]  The Army National Guard is engaging in the same type activities minus the live fire and burning structures.
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:07.160]  But when it came to the practice takeover of a private civilian airport, all the same.
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:09.160]  In Temple, Texas.
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:12.160]  So are y'all just in support of the takeover of the airport?
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:15.160]  Uh, yes.
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:17.160]  That's what they just told us over there.
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:20.160]  So yes, y'all are just supporting the officers of the takeover of the airport.
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:22.160]  Yes.
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:27.160]  And we were telling us it could be for here in the U.S. or overseas?
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:29.160]  Possibly.
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:31.160]  Well, they tell you all that, huh?
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:34.160]  Yeah, we're just working out of it.
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:39.160]  Because we have aircraft, we're supporting the aircraft, so you have to have an airfield, so we just...
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:41.160]  Just getting the local authorities used to working?
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:42.160]  Yeah.
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:43.160]  Working together.
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:52.160]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:56.160]  Our soldiers are now authorized to make any comments or anything.
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:59.160]  Oh, okay, the soldiers are authorized to talk to us?
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:02.160]  We are authorized to make any comments or anything.
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  Okay, okay.
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:13.160]  Are y'all out here when the Czech troops were here?
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:17.160]  Yes, they were here on Wednesday.
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.160]  Oh, the Czech troops were?
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:19.160]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  What were they doing?
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:22.160]  They just...
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:25.160]  I think they were just stopping by, I don't know.
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:26.160]  They were just stopping by?
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:27.160]  Uh-huh.
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:29.160]  Y'all are just Army reserves, aren't you?
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:31.160]  Yeah, we are Army National Guard.
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:35.160]  We're here for two weeks, 18 Temple, Texas.
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:38.160]  So basically, this isn't a Delta Force operation?
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:39.160]  No, it's not.
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:40.160]  No, it's not.
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:42.160]  You know, they visited Texas back in February?
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:43.160]  Yes.
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:44.160]  Uh-huh.
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:45.160]  There were some buildings that got burned.
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:46.160]  The police chief threw them out.
[1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:47.160]  Yeah.
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:49.160]  San Antonio Alley and Philippus, he's former Army intelligence,
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:50.160]  just like the military.
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:51.160]  Yeah.
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:53.160]  They fired in an all-night restaurant, too.
[1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:54.160]  Kind of a big stink.
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.160]  Yeah, I think the best way to find out about the Czech
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:12:59.160]  is when I operate some people down here.
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:00.160]  Operation people?
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:01.160]  Yeah, in the front.
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:03.160]  So basically, y'all are just all maneuvers.
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:05.160]  I live in Austin, and I literally saw them
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.160]  maybe in the same helicopters,
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:08.160]  but over a three-day period last week,
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:10.160]  I saw hundreds of helicopters.
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.160]  I even saw a Russian hind.
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:14.160]  Are y'all practicing in those or something?
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:15.160]  No, no, we're not.
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.160]  I heard we missed the Czech troops.
[1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:18.160]  The Czech troops.
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:20.160]  You ever heard there were some Czechoslovakian troops here?
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.160]  Yeah, there were some Czechoslovakian officers here.
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.160]  Oh, really?
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:25.160]  Or were they just checking out how the U.S. operates?
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:26.160]  I'm not sure.
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.160]  They were with the Public Affairs Office out here.
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:29.160]  Oh, really?
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:30.160]  What's your name, sir?
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:32.160]  Major Canyon.
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:33.160]  Major Canyon.
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:35.160]  What is the exercise y'all are conducting here
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:38.160]  at the Temple, Texas Municipal Airport?
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.160]  Okay, we're here acting like we're being deployed
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:42.160]  and occupying an airport,
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:43.160]  and then staging out of here
[1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:46.160]  and operating our missions out of the airport.
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:47.160]  Did you get that, Mike?
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:48.160]  Yeah.
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:51.160]  Anyways, of course this is for overseas troops.
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:54.160]  Either overseas or something local.
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:58.160]  So are y'all just in support of the takeover of the airport?
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:01.160]  Uh, yes.
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:03.160]  That's what they just told us over there, sir.
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:05.160]  So yes, y'all are just supporting the officers
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:06.160]  of the takeover of the airport?
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:08.160]  Yes.
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:11.160]  And we were telling us it could be for here in the U.S.
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:14.160]  or overseas?
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:15.160]  Possibly.
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:16.160]  Really?
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:18.160]  They tell y'all that, huh?
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.160]  Yeah, somewhat, you know what I mean.
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:22.160]  I think you guys are kind of smiling.
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.160]  What tell ya?
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:27.160]  I can't tell you anything anymore than he could.
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:28.160]  We have aircraft.
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:29.160]  We're supporting the aircraft,
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.160]  so you have to have an airfield.
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:35.160]  We're just getting the local authorities used to working.
[1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:38.160]  Working together.
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:41.160]  Don't be talking to anybody.
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:43.160]  I'm going to go to a public information office.
[1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:45.160]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:49.160]  Our soldiers are not authorized to make any comments or anything.
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:50.160]  Oh, okay.
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:52.160]  The soldiers are not authorized to talk to us.
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:56.160]  Okay, okay.
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:03.160]  Okay.
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:06.160]  Upon entering the once civilian terminal
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:08.160]  at the Temple Municipal Airport,
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:11.160]  we were told to leave.
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:15.160]  Though politely, it still points to something ominous.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:18.160]  We're just here for a two-week period.
[1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:20.160]  Oh, just for a two-week period?
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:23.160]  How long ago did y'all move in? About a week ago?
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:25.160]  No, we're here for two weeks at a time.
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:27.160]  Oh, cool.
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:28.160]  Who you with?
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.160]  Oh, I got a little radio show, a little syndicated talk show,
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:32.160]  and I also make documentaries.
[1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:33.160]  Thank you.
[1:15:33.160 --> 1:15:34.160]  How you doing?
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:36.160]  Pretty good.
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:39.160]  So y'all are just practicing taking over the airport?
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:40.160]  No.
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:43.160]  Can I introduce you to somebody that...
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:45.160]  I already talked to you about this.
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:46.160]  Yeah.
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:47.160]  We're just practicing occupying the airport.
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:48.160]  Yeah.
[1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:49.160]  That's just been taken over.
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:50.160]  Okay.
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:51.160]  We're just having a meeting in here,
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:52.160]  so please ask you to leave.
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:53.160]  Oh, okay.
[1:15:53.160 --> 1:15:54.160]  Leave the municipal airport?
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:55.160]  Sure we will.
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:57.160]  No, leave the terminal building.
[1:15:57.160 --> 1:15:58.160]  Leave the terminal building.
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:15:59.160]  Okay, thanks a lot.
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:00.160]  Okay.
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:01.160]  Appreciate it.
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:02.160]  Thanks for the help.
[1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:20.160]  The place is Hebron, Maryland.
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:23.160]  The date is September 3rd and 4th, 1998.
[1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:26.160]  Another one of my listeners in Hebron, Maryland,
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:30.160]  sent me this amateur videotape and accompanying news articles.
[1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:35.160]  I called and confirmed his story with the sheriff and others in the town.
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:38.160]  The Marines came in, over 70 of them,
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:42.160]  and engaged in a takeover of the town from the courthouse
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:45.160]  to other centers of city government,
[1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:48.160]  and then they went out during the day and at night
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:50.160]  and engaged in mock gun confiscations
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:54.160]  aided by citizens and, yes, even adolescents and young children
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:58.160]  on bicycles looking for the supposed terrorist.
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.160]  All part of training, our law enforcement, our military,
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:05.160]  and our local constabulary is all around the country
[1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:08.160]  that it's normal activity to have children and others
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:10.160]  engaged with the military,
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:12.160]  tattling on citizens.
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:16.160]  This is nothing but pure preparation for martial law.
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:20.160]  Again, Hebron, Maryland, 1998.
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:22.160]  Are you the sheriff?
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:23.160]  Yes, I am.
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.160]  So tell me what's happening here.
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:27.160]  Hold on.
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:29.160]  I don't have to repeat this again, though.
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:31.160]  Well, some of it, a little bit.
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:35.160]  I won't take too long because I got some food over there waiting for me.
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:39.160]  I just got a military exercise training
[1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:42.160]  at being conducted in a civilian population
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:46.160]  in full support with the community, with the sheriff's office.
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:48.160]  Oh, yeah, you fully support it?
[1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:49.160]  Absolutely.
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:51.160]  And what is the purpose of it?
[1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:54.160]  It's to give these young marine second lieutenants
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:56.160]  an opportunity for some real world training
[1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:01.160]  with nine combatants who have been exposed to something like this.
[1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:04.160]  So, therefore, they're not choreographed in any way.
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:06.160]  They haven't been exposed to this kind of training before?
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:07.160]  No.
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:10.160]  Weren't they going door to door to a few houses?
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:13.160]  They are going door to door to some houses,
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:15.160]  but they're going door to door to houses
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:18.160]  where the people in those houses have already volunteered
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:19.160]  to be a part of the training action.
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:21.160]  And what are they going to do when they get to the house?
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:22.160]  I'm not sure.
[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:24.160]  They can talk it over with the people that have volunteered,
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:27.160]  but they're going to be going no houses or no place in town
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:29.160]  so that's where there's not a volunteer spirit.
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:32.160]  But they're going to do gun confiscation, right?
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:33.160]  Oh, no, not my town.
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:34.160]  Weapons?
[1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:36.160]  No gun confiscation.
[1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:38.160]  Well, they're going to confiscate artificial weapons.
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:40.160]  Well, if that's part of the training scenario,
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:42.160]  but they're not taking any civilian weapons.
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:45.160]  Well, they're taking what is supposed to be, right?
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:48.160]  Mock weapons as if it were the citizens' weapons?
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:51.160]  Now, that I'm not sure of, but if they are,
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:55.160]  it's as far as their training scenario and their items
[1:18:55.160 --> 1:18:58.160]  that they have brought as far as their training equipment.
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:18:59.160]  Right, but they're training in order
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:01.160]  so they could confiscate weapons.
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:03.160]  I think that's the case here.
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:11.160]  Yeah.
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:13.160]  You guys are using the ladder instead of, like,
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:15.160]  climbing by a rope or something.
[1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:19.160]  The ladder's quicker, easier to get gear up to the roof.
[1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:21.160]  Would you have to carry it through the field
[1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:23.160]  if you were, like, really...
[1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:25.160]  Well, the idea is that since we're in town,
[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:28.160]  we're going to be able to get one in this surrounding area
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:30.160]  and get one of these.
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:31.160]  What?
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:33.160]  Yeah.
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:35.160]  I can't hear you.
[1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:37.160]  You're also going to see
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:39.160]  plain-closed Marine Corps spies
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:42.160]  going around coordinating the operations,
[1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:44.160]  coordinating local police,
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:48.160]  the military, and the Tattletail citizens
[1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:51.160]  to deal with the deadly dangerous terrorist
[1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:53.160]  right here in America.
[1:19:53.160 --> 1:20:03.160]  Hey, is the patrol going out right now?
[1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:05.160]  Hey, we got another patrol going out.
[1:20:05.160 --> 1:20:07.160]  The first patrol doesn't know anything about the house call.
[1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:08.160]  Just leave them alone.
[1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:10.160]  They'll get to the house call on time.
[1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:11.160]  Got it?
[1:20:11.160 --> 1:20:12.160]  Okay, I'm just trying to figure out
[1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:16.160]  who we need to walk with.
[1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:41.160]  Well, you just heard it for yourself.
[1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:42.160]  The United States Marine Corps,
[1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:45.160]  with plain-closed officers wandering around
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:21:12.160]  talking about house calls.
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:13.160]  The amateur cameraman
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:16.160]  that got us this footage lives in Maryland.
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:18.160]  He had every right to get this footage,
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:19.160]  but once the sun went down,
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:21.160]  the local police and the military
[1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:24.160]  did not want him to get some of the key footage,
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:27.160]  the rating of the homes.
[1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:29.160]  Again, what do they have to hide?
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:33.160]  What are they doing with that?
[1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:37.160]  Okay, we have four individuals running around the town.
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:40.160]  They're just basically acting as aggressors, bad guys,
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:43.160]  and their mission is once the officers and the lieutenants
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:45.160]  come in, their mission is to go out
[1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:46.160]  and seek these insurgents
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:48.160]  and see if they can locate them
[1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:50.160]  and remove them from the population.
[1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:51.160]  And you haven't started doing that yet?
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:53.160]  No, not at all.
[1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:55.160]  And what kind of stuff are they going to do?
[1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:56.160]  Like, act like they're shooting at you
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:21:57.160]  and stuff like that?
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:59.160]  Basically, it was just a typical marine training exercise.
[1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:00.160]  They have weapons.
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:02.160]  They could be firing blank ammunition,
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:04.160]  just basic urban controlling.
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:06.160]  Just be doing that now in the street and stuff.
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:08.160]  And tell me about the door-to-door stuff
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.160]  that you're going to do.
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:12.160]  Like, was it four houses or what?
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:13.160]  It's four houses.
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:14.160]  And what are you going to do?
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:16.160]  What we're going to do is we're going to plant
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:18.160]  some rubber weapons in there,
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:20.160]  toy guns, per se.
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:22.160]  And you're just going to go into regular citizens' homes
[1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:23.160]  doing this?
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:26.160]  Actually, the citizens have volunteered to services.
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:28.160]  They volunteer to be role-players.
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:30.160]  And they've allowed us to use their homes.
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:31.160]  And what are they going to do?
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:33.160]  Are any of them going to act like they don't want you to do it?
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.160]  Or are they all going to act like they don't want you to do it?
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:37.160]  Well, some are going to be friendly.
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:38.160]  Some are going to be belligerent.
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:40.160]  Some are going to be uncooperative.
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.160]  That's the scenario that we're going to train.
[1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:44.160]  Oh, and it's just going to be the people who live in the house
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.160]  that are doing this role-playing.
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:47.160]  What about there?
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:49.160]  Are there going to be kids in the house?
[1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:50.160]  The kids are more excited.
[1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:51.160]  I don't think the kids,
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:53.160]  maybe there might be a few kids running around, whatever,
[1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:55.160]  but, you know, the kids might not...
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:56.160]  Now, what are you going to do?
[1:22:56.160 --> 1:22:57.160]  Are you going to arrest the people?
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:22:58.160]  Are we going to arrest the people?
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:00.160]  Well, or act out that you're whatever.
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:01.160]  No, no, sir.
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.160]  We're not going to arrest anyone.
[1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.160]  What are you going to do to them?
[1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:04.160]  Nothing.
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:05.160]  Go up to them and ask them questions,
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:07.160]  if they've seen any subversive activities.
[1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:08.160]  You have to understand,
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:10.160]  these people have been versed in their roles.
[1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:11.160]  Yeah, I understand.
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:12.160]  I'm not like...
[1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:13.160]  You're going to like...
[1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:14.160]  I mean, they're going to say,
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:15.160]  when they're resisting,
[1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.160]  what are you going to do?
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:17.160]  Are you going to grab them like and stuff?
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:21.160]  The people aren't playing the role of the resistance.
[1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:23.160]  Oh, they're just going to talk stuff, but not...
[1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:25.160]  They're just civilians.
[1:23:25.160 --> 1:23:26.160]  Oh, yeah.
[1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:27.160]  Oh, I didn't know if they were going to act
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:28.160]  like they're resisting,
[1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:29.160]  and you're going to act like you're,
[1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:32.160]  like, arresting them or shooting them or...
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:34.160]  No, we're not assaulting anything.
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:35.160]  The resistance don't want you or anything?
[1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:36.160]  No, sir.
[1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.160]  Oh, okay.
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:39.160]  And then what's going to happen
[1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:40.160]  besides that, Dan?
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:42.160]  What about the rooftop stuff?
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:43.160]  The rooftop?
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:44.160]  Rooftop?
[1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:45.160]  I don't know.
[1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:46.160]  What rooftop?
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:47.160]  I heard you guys were going to go
[1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:48.160]  and take over buildings or something,
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:50.160]  maybe from the insurgents or something?
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:52.160]  I don't know anything about it.
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:55.160]  Oh, nothing about that.
[1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:56.160]  So maybe that's just whatever happens,
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:00.160]  whatever the insurgents decide to do or something?
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:01.160]  If you don't mind me asking,
[1:24:01.160 --> 1:24:02.160]  where are you from?
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:03.160]  From Baltimore.
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:04.160]  Baltimore?
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:05.160]  Yeah.
[1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:06.160]  Baltimore, Maryland.
[1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:07.160]  Not that far.
[1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:08.160]  Nice town.
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:10.160]  Yeah, it's pretty nice town.
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:11.160]  Thank you.
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:31.160]  There he is.
[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.160]  I'm not carrying him over here.
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:35.160]  I got to get used to looking at this camera.
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:36.160]  It's weird.
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:48.160]  Again, this is amateur camera work,
[1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:50.160]  and for some reason the cameraman
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:52.160]  didn't really know what he was videotaping,
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:55.160]  but upon speaking to him later in depth,
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:57.160]  it was clear the entire day
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:00.160]  small children, again, were aiding
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  the United States Marine Corps
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:05.160]  in tattling and looking for the subversives.
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:09.160]  This is right out of mind comp, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:12.160]  This is Nazi-esque behavior.
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:30.160]  The tattletail police.
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:32.160]  Imagine Marines in your back yard,
[1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:33.160]  in your front yard,
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:36.160]  walking down your streets in the middle of the night.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:38.160]  Well, you're a patriot, aren't you?
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:39.160]  Well, I certainly am,
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:42.160]  but this is a deadly, dangerous precedent
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:43.160]  that's being set.
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:45.160]  They're brainwashing our military.
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:47.160]  Now, if they had nothing to hide,
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:50.160]  I'm a little confused by their actions.
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:52.160]  The police began to get more and more aggressive
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:53.160]  as the night wore on,
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:56.160]  simply because this average Joe Q. citizen
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:58.160]  was trying to catch some videotape
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.160]  with the bizarre activities.
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:01.160]  Oh, nothing.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:03.160]  I just said I didn't have it on then anyway.
[1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:04.160]  I was talking to you.
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:11.160]  How are you doing?
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:12.160]  What's that?
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:14.160]  It's a good evening.
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:16.160]  How are you doing that, sir?
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:17.160]  Very good, yourself.
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:19.160]  How are you doing?
[1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:20.160]  Not bad.
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:22.160]  Were you the same guy who was here earlier?
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:24.160]  Lesson number one,
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:34.160]  never turn off the video camera,
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:36.160]  even though you feel intimidated.
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:39.160]  I've seen this, I can't tell you how many times.
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:43.160]  Sheldon, the amateur cameraman,
[1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:45.160]  turned off his camera when confronted
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:47.160]  by the sheriff's deputy.
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:49.160]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:51.160]  look right there on your screen
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:53.160]  right before he turned the camera on.
[1:26:53.160 --> 1:26:56.160]  A Marine with a fully automatic weapon.
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:26:59.160]  The point is, you see the relationship building here.
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:04.160]  Sheriff's deputy and military officer.
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:06.160]  Now, let's try to figure this out.
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:07.160]  Just for a second.
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:10.160]  Are they going to load our police
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:12.160]  up with our Marines on C-130s
[1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:14.160]  and fly them overseas?
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:17.160]  Hmm, just a question I have.
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:19.160]  Where are you going, man?
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:21.160]  Where am I going?
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:23.160]  Where am I going?
[1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:25.160]  Where am I?
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:27.160]  Where are you going?
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:29.160]  What do you want?
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:31.160]  About what?
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:32.160]  About your activity.
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:34.160]  What's my activity? What's wrong?
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:35.160]  I need to be here.
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:37.160]  Well,
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:39.160]  I'm doing something.
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:41.160]  I'm doing something, too.
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:43.160]  I need to talk to someone here.
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:45.160]  Why are they around my truck?
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:47.160]  They're making a body.
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:49.160]  What do you want?
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:51.160]  How about that?
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:53.160]  Sure.
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:55.160]  Okay.
[1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:57.160]  What do you want?
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:59.160]  What is your point?
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:01.160]  Well, that's America.
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:03.160]  You just saw the camera shut off.
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:05.160]  He was told if he did any more videotaping,
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:07.160]  he'd be going to jail.
[1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:09.160]  And there's the police officer
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:11.160]  that told him to turn his camera off.
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:13.160]  Getting multiple visitations
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:15.160]  for walking down one of the main streets
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.160]  of Hebron, Maryland, in the state
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:19.160]  where Sheldon Green lives.
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:23.160]  I've gotten a chance to get to know Sheldon
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:25.160]  long distance since I got this tape
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:27.160]  almost a year ago.
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:29.160]  He's a great guy.
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:31.160]  Being treated like a criminal.
[1:28:31.160 --> 1:28:33.160]  For only asking questions
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.160]  and videotaping the
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:37.160]  urban warfare training
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:39.160]  and disarmament scenario,
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:41.160]  turn your camera off
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:43.160]  while the Marines
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:45.160]  check out your truck.
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:47.160]  They're in black and white
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.160]  night vision video for you.
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:51.160]  Well, here we are
[1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:53.160]  in Northern California in Oakland.
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:55.160]  And Marines
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:28:57.160]  have come in for Operation Urban Warrior.
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:28:59.160]  What should be deemed operation
[1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:01.160]  desensitization of the population.
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:03.160]  And they have the role players.
[1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:05.160]  They have their fake camp
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:07.160]  set up. You name it.
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:09.160]  We're going to take you in
[1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:15.160]  for a moment.
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:19.160]  We're going to take you in for a moment.
[1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:29.160]  We're going to take you in for a moment.
[1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:39.160]  We're going to take you in for a moment.
[1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:49.160]  We're going to take you in for a moment.
[1:30:49.160 --> 1:30:57.160]  We're going to take you in for a moment.
[1:30:57.160 --> 1:31:03.160]  We're going to take you in for a moment.
[1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:35.160]  They're preparing people for what is coming,
[1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:37.160]  not what is being presented today.
[1:31:37.160 --> 1:31:39.160]  So you're saying they're preparing people
[1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:41.160]  to accept it with incrementalism.
[1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:43.160]  That is correct. Like the old frog example.
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:45.160]  You put the frog in the water
[1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:47.160]  and you just gradually
[1:31:47.160 --> 1:31:49.160]  continue to raise the heat on the water
[1:31:49.160 --> 1:31:51.160]  until the frog is cooked.
[1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:53.160]  That's the way it works.
[1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:55.160]  The problem is that the local people,
[1:31:55.160 --> 1:31:57.160]  people in general,
[1:31:57.160 --> 1:31:59.160]  just will not take their
[1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:01.160]  heads out of the sand.
[1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.160]  They don't realize that when the head is in the sand,
[1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:05.160]  the other part of the body
[1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.160]  is totally exposed to problems.
[1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:09.160]  I don't care.
[1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:11.160]  If I'm just the only person screaming
[1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:13.160]  like the voice in the wilderness,
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:15.160]  if I'm only the
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:17.160]  Paul Revere of Oakland,
[1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:19.160]  I'm going to tell everyone I can,
[1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:21.160]  listen, we have a serious problem.
[1:32:21.160 --> 1:32:23.160]  It's called the police state.
[1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:25.160]  After all the evidence
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:27.160]  you've seen the last hour and a half,
[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:29.160]  how could you deny what's going on?
[1:32:29.160 --> 1:32:31.160]  Well, if this hasn't convinced you,
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:33.160]  get ready. Local police
[1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:35.160]  in Alameda and Oakland,
[1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:37.160]  working with the military, the US military,
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:39.160]  the US Marine Corps and urban warrior,
[1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.160]  as well as foreign troops,
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:43.160]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:45.160]  That's right. Foreign troops,
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:47.160]  right there on your screen,
[1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.160]  and having, speaking of screens,
[1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:51.160]  computers, satellites, tracking,
[1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:53.160]  watching, meanwhile,
[1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:55.160]  the cameras are going up.
[1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:57.160]  It's time for us all to realize
[1:32:57.160 --> 1:32:59.160]  what's happening here.
[1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:01.160]  There you have it, tracking
[1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:03.160]  the population.
[1:33:03.160 --> 1:33:05.160]  My friends, this is totally
[1:33:05.160 --> 1:33:07.160]  unconstitutional, and looking at a
[1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:09.160]  historical reference, it is terrifying
[1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:11.160]  to see military working with
[1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:13.160]  police, then you add in foreign troops,
[1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:15.160]  paid actors saying, we're Americans,
[1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:17.160]  you can't do this to us.
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:19.160]  They're conditioning the police,
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:21.160]  the military and the public.
[1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:23.160]  Think about it. It's clear,
[1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:25.160]  the American people have been designated
[1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:27.160]  the enemy.
[1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:29.160]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:31.160]  it's the federal government
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:33.160]  that is destroying the sovereignty
[1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:35.160]  of this nation, the United States of America.
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:37.160]  It is
[1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:39.160]  their problem, they're the crisis,
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:41.160]  they're the threat, they're the
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:43.160]  terrorist, and I'm sad
[1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:45.160]  to see our military and our police
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:47.160]  being merged, and to see
[1:33:47.160 --> 1:33:49.160]  them changing from peace officers
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:51.160]  and defenders of the
[1:33:51.160 --> 1:33:53.160]  country, into
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:55.160]  thugs, and bullies
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:57.160]  for the bureaucrats, and their foreign
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:33:59.160]  banker globalist controllers.
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:01.160]  It would be
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:03.160]  a partnership for a monitor that would be
[1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:05.160]  placed on each marine, and the monitor and the vital signs.
[1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:07.160]  We were in the same
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:09.160]  way as the person locator
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:11.160]  who I thought that, where
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.160]  a doctor or a medic or a formative
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:15.160]  monitor from a safe distance
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:17.160]  to everybody's body.
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:19.160]  It's a problem.
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:21.160]  It's their body.
[1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:25.160]  Why is that important?
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:27.160]  The way it works now is for the squad
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:29.160]  to have a medic clip them.
[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:31.160]  They're expecting resistance,
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:33.160]  and we'll be getting CNN with cameras.
[1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:37.160]  That woman lives there. Maybe
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:39.160]  her children are out in sleep.
[1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:41.160]  Hey, they're going in there.
[1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.160]  I'm going to go in and rescue my kids, right?
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:45.160]  In the past, that might be interpreted as
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:47.160]  a
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:49.160]  hostile act.
[1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:55.160]  One of the technologies
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:57.160]  that makes you nauseous.
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:34:59.160]  In the past,
[1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:01.160]  in a situation like that, she might have been
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:03.160]  shot.
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:05.160]  In the future, we want to give our marines
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:07.160]  non-lethal options where they can say,
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:09.160]  no, she's not armed,
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:11.160]  maybe threatening, but I don't want
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:13.160]  to kill her or I don't want to kill him
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:15.160]  or them.
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:17.160]  Use your sound wave rifle,
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:19.160]  I guess you could call it, and down
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:21.160]  they go.
[1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:23.160]  You guys have heard of the sticky gun?
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:25.160]  Yeah. Sure you've seen that.
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:27.160]  We're trying to come up with new stuff now
[1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:29.160]  for crowd control, etc.
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:31.160]  We've got a group of civilians
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:33.160]  that are trying to break through a barrier.
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:35.160]  Instead of unloading with a saw into them,
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:37.160]  you just have a sticky gun.
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:39.160]  All of a sudden, boom, they can't move.
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:41.160]  All kinds of things, the Marine Corps
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:43.160]  and the United States military is trying to do
[1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:45.160]  to minimize the amount of people that
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:47.160]  have to be killed.
[1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:49.160]  They're going to prison.
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:51.160]  Are you going to see an execution?
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:53.160]  So you can see, she went running in there
[1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:55.160]  saying, I live here.
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:57.160]  There's a prisoner.
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:35:59.160]  Typical of what you see in an urban
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:01.160]  environment, people hanging out
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:03.160]  doing nothing.
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:05.160]  And as we know, idle time is the devil's
[1:36:05.160 --> 1:36:07.160]  hands.
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:09.160]  We've been saying people don't have jobs.
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:11.160]  They don't have a home to go to
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:13.160]  or home if they want to go to.
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:15.160]  So they just hang out all day long.
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:17.160]  You have a local
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:19.160]  legislator over there and then none.
[1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:21.160]  You have a church right here.
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:23.160]  You have some Marines conducting an interview
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:25.160]  over here, what it looks like.
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:31.160]  Right now, everything's calm.
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:33.160]  Everybody seems to make a tent.
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:35.160]  But at any minute, this could erupt
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:37.160]  into a riot.
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:39.160]  We were in Oak Knoll for
[1:36:39.160 --> 1:36:41.160]  five days
[1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:43.160]  in Oakland, California.
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:45.160]  But the footage you're seeing was amateur.
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.160]  You see, the media was taken on a stage
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:49.160]  tour.
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:51.160]  You'll see some of our footage later.
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:53.160]  This is the guided tours for the public
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:55.160]  during the exercises.
[1:36:55.160 --> 1:36:57.160]  And when the Marines have a problem
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:36:59.160]  or when the police have a problem
[1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:01.160]  dealing with the civilians, they call
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:05.160]  in the backup and the battle begins.
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:11.160]  Oh, by the way, I hope you enjoyed
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.160]  seeing the foreign troops earlier
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:41.160]  helping keep the Americans under control.
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:43.160]  Let's go.
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:45.160]  Let's go.
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:47.160]  Let's go.
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:55.160]  Cut, you.
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:59.160]  Hey, don't turn around.
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:01.160]  Hey?
[1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:05.160]  Jerkett, yeah.
[1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:07.160]  We'll cut this.
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:09.160]  No, you see it, don't you?
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:25.160]  Hey! Open the roof!
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:26.160]  What?
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:27.160]  The roof?
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:28.160]  The roof?
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:30.160]  No, not the roof.
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:32.160]  They have to keep the roof open.
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:33.160]  What?
[1:38:33.160 --> 1:38:40.160]  Yeah.
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:44.160]  Now watch how they treat this civilian.
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:45.160]  Boom!
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:46.160]  They kick him.
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:47.160]  Get out of there.
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:50.160]  He scurries past the foreign troops
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:54.160]  from the Royal Netherlands
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:56.160]  and then they and SWAT team's styles
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:38:58.160]  stacked up, get ready to raid
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:00.160]  and kick in the doors.
[1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:02.160]  Besides, these people are lazy.
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:03.160]  They have to be dealt with.
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:06.160]  You heard the Marine Corps officer earlier, didn't you?
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:22.160]  I'm very glad to see that the humanitarian assistance
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:35.160]  is going well.
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:37.160]  When the police can't handle it,
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:40.160]  they just call in the foreign troops.
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:42.160]  Everything's okay, working together,
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:44.160]  speaking English, speaking foreign languages,
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:46.160]  working with police, speaking English.
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:52.160]  Hey, otherwise, we're going to overwhelm them, you know?
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:53.160]  Thank God.
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:54.160]  Go!
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:55.160]  Go!
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:56.160]  Go!
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:57.160]  Go!
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:39:58.160]  Go!
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:39:59.160]  Go!
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:00.160]  Go!
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:01.160]  Go!
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:02.160]  Go!
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:03.160]  Go!
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:04.160]  Go!
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:05.160]  Go!
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:06.160]  Go!
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:07.160]  Go!
[1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:08.160]  Go!
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:09.160]  Go!
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:10.160]  Go!
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:11.160]  Go!
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:12.160]  Go!
[1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:23.160]  Go!
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:29.160]  Go!
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:41.160]  Go!
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:44.000]  Waaaaaaaa!
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:45.240]  You can keep it a little more.
[1:40:53.260 --> 1:40:55.400]  Attention, attention, attention.
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:40:57.800]  American forces are here to help.
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:59.240]  Remain calm.
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.860]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:06.120]  Attention, attention, attention.
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:08.360]  American forces are here to help.
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:11.120]  Please, please remain calm.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:23.120]  Let's move, let's move, right in the middle of the experiment.
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:37.120]  I need you guys to move, man, I'm not saying anything.
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:38.120]  Zoom in down there.
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  Notice the defensive posture, ladies and gentlemen, of the tanks surrounding the camp.
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:49.120]  We were run off during our staged guided tour.
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:55.120]  We were told later, by internal sources, they were staging a defense of the camp.
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  Someone was going to try to free people and that can't be allowed.
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  How's it going over at the camp?
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:09.120]  I'm very well. The guys are doing exercises now. They're doing very well.
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  So the camp situation is going good with the disarmament and things?
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:14.120]  Oh yeah.
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:17.120]  Because we saw them over there disarming people. Is that what the exercise is?
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:18.120]  They're exercising now, yeah.
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:20.120]  Fantastic. Where are you from, sir?
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:21.120]  Holland.
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:22.120]  Oh, okay.
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:23.120]  From the Best Marines.
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:28.120]  Now, this poor fellow is going to be taken into the mock police station,
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  handcuffed and then transported to the camp for his best interest.
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  Again, he must be a dangerous extremist.
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:43:02.120]  I have rights. I have rights, please.
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:11.120]  I have rights.
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:16.120]  Staging for a big offensive against the civilians. It's so much fun.
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:32.120]  It's a track.
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:57.120]  Sir, is this where you take the digital photos?
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:00.120]  Yes, sir. That's the station we take digital photos here.
[1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  I send them straight to Sergeant Smith and he processes it and he puts them on ID cards, sir.
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:12.120]  Oh, so the people coming into the camp get ID cards?
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:20.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:31.120]  Who's the mayor?
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:35.120]  We have someone reporting to be the mayor of Boolean.
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  Do you know who the mayor of Boolean is?
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:49.120]  Jerry Brown.
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  Where did you acquire the helmet?
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  Someone just gave it to me. I just put it on.
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  Where did they give it to you?
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:58.120]  It was laying on the field and someone just handed it over to me.
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:00.120]  I was in the wrong way.
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:02.120]  Where we got on the helicopter.
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:06.120]  Well, as usual, the Army officials would not let us view the entire interrogation.
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:18.120]  As you heard, they told us to get out of there.
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:23.120]  Do you guys want to take the air to process the process?
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:26.120]  There's a few rules and regulations that you must abide by.
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  One of them, the weapons is allowed upon board the campus.
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  The ID card that you have on your person needs to stay out where we can see you.
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:36.120]  These are the only means we have to identify you.
[1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:43.120]  We are family members. We need you to keep your family members together as you are ultimately responsible for them.
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:46.120]  If you have any questions out there, please ask one of the Marines.
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:50.120]  I'd be glad to help you answer any questions you might have.
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  Can you say that one more time again?
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  If you have any questions, please contact one of the Marines out there.
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:00.120]  They'll answer any questions you might have.
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:04.120]  Sauer hours are going from children from 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:07.120]  for women from 6 to 8 p.m.
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:10.120]  and for men from 8 to 10 p.m.
[1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:12.120]  Thank you very much.
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:15.120]  You've been very informative and very courteous.
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  I really appreciate it.
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.120]  Thank you very much.
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  Does anybody have any questions?
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:24.120]  There's a few regulations you must abide by while on this camp.
[1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:28.120]  No weapons will be tolerated on the camp and no disturbances will be tolerated on the camp either.
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:32.120]  Do you have some way to quarter or corral, these folks?
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:34.120]  That's another great question.
[1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:40.120]  I've got to tell you that in an actual environment, we would work very, very closely with local government.
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  If this was a domestic crisis like an earthquake or a fire, then we would be working very, very close
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:50.120]  and hand-in-hand with FEMA and the American Red Cross, for example.
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:55.120]  And they would be in here helping us, or we would be actually helping them.
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  If we were doing this, let's say, in a Somalia or a Bangladesh or some other foreign country that had invited us in,
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:06.120]  then certainly we would be working with other non-governmental organizations and private organizations
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:08.120]  and certainly government organizations.
[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:10.120]  International and like the United Nations?
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:14.120]  Certainly. You bet. We would really be here to provide support to them.
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:23.120]  Is there a concern that they may be terrorists or someone who might not be welcome in the camp coming into the camp?
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  Yes, certainly. That's why the first thing we do is we make sure that there are no weapons coming into the camp.
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  Once they get into the camp, they'll come through the processing tent,
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:38.120]  and we do get some information from them so that we can track other family members,
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:46.120]  and we talk to them, and we would certainly try to identify any known or suspected terrorists and separate them out from the rest.
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:49.120]  We actually have a place where we would separate them.
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  There are collection points where we would collect enemy prisoners of war,
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  and then they would be evacuated to the rear.
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  Oh, to a secure facility?
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:04.120]  I'm sure we want to protect them, too.
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:10.120]  I need to speak with Major Braddock, your security chief, your security chief, Miller.
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  I need to get to the town mayor. She's in a meeting.
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:18.120]  Okay, let's go and bring those two in.
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:20.120]  Yeah, we're going to get fed.
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:22.120]  You need to get fed.
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:24.120]  Let us out, let us out.
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:28.120]  Can you get off the screen?
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:32.120]  Can you point out the enemies on the screen?
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:36.120]  Yeah, again, here's the red icons are an example of an enemy unit there,
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:42.120]  and again, we're using Milstander 2525 symbology, which is a little bit new to the military right now.
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  And that's the criminal group?
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:50.120]  Well, again, it could be an enemy unit, or it could be an unknown unit, it could be just a civilian group.
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  We don't know, again, it depends on how it's reported, and that's just an example.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  So, this is the criminal group, this is the terrorist group, this is a civilian group, this is an infantry unit.
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:02.120]  Who's the infantry?
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  It could be an enemy infantry unit, unknown size and type.
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:06.120]  Okay.
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:12.120]  If I see a group of enemy infantry, and I don't know what size and type it is, it's just an unknown enemy unit.
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:16.120]  So we've got terrorists, we've got criminal groups, we've got infantry groups,
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:18.120]  and there's an armored vehicle at the enemy house?
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  Correct.
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  The symbology ID is ready up here.
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:24.120]  This is an armored vehicle.
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:25.120]  We've got five units.
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:27.120]  Any families that drive this vehicle?
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.120]  Okay, these guys have plastic handcuffs available.
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:34.120]  You'll see it in the gentleman's mouth right there.
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:36.120]  He's got a plastic handcuff.
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:40.120]  These are handcuffs that are used to control dissidents.
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:46.120]  You see, he's turning it into a handcuff by looping one through the other.
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:58.120]  And they'll be used to put on persons names.
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:03.120]  Basically, this is a place where people are identified.
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:07.120]  Here's the plastic handcuffs right here.
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:10.120]  We're interfering with the exercise at this point, okay?
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:12.120]  They won't tolerate civil disobedience.
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  This is a place where they're going to use the plastic handcuffs again
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  to see them right here in the soldier's hands.
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:25.120]  This is where people are restrained, identified as possible terrorists.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  Let's go, please.
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  This is a site that we've been warned away from by the people operating this.
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:41.120]  They don't want us to see people restrained in handcuffs.
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:48.120]  This is something that they don't want us to be able to video.
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:53.120]  I'm not going to bring a foreign officer up and have me insulted, okay?
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  Insulting?
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:55.120]  Yeah.
[1:50:55.120 --> 1:50:56.120]  But did I insult him?
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.120]  Well, I'm not saying you did, but you're getting close, okay?
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:50:59.120]  So I'm not going to do that.
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:02.120]  If you're going to intervene, I'll be more than happy to do that.
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:03.120]  How did I get close?
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:04.120]  I mean, I'm just curious.
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.120]  You're asking me, you know what you're doing.
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:07.120]  So that's all I'm saying.
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:08.120]  I was asking about the UN.
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:09.120]  Okay.
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.120]  I'll be the foreign officer for you.
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.120]  And he was on UN duty.
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:16.120]  So a lot of the older people are getting out of the Marines.
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:20.120]  Basically, it's all going to a younger type of person.
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.120]  Oh, they've actually changed.
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:33.120]  Well, it's mainly more young people are being involved with the new time of change, a change of time.
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:38.120]  So guys, is the main assault about to start?
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:39.120]  Pretty soon, here.
[1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:40.120]  Pretty soon.
[1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:44.120]  So they just basically let us see the soft stuff, huh?
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:45.120]  Right.
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:48.120]  You said right?
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:49.120]  Yeah.
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:53.120]  So you all are about to go in and take out the terrorist, huh?
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:55.120]  Pretty much, yeah.
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:56.120]  Pretty much.
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:58.120]  Who are the terrorists?
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:51:59.120]  I thought I'm off.
[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:00.120]  We're really powerful.
[1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:01.120]  Valerie says that.
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:04.120]  Who's the main complement of terrorists?
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:05.120]  What's that?
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:10.120]  I mean, basically, we just saw the soft stuff.
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:12.120]  You all are about to go in and do a major assault.
[1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:13.120]  Exactly, yeah.
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:14.120]  We're going to go in.
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:15.120]  We're going to hit the terrorists.
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:16.120]  Take them out.
[1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  They've been causing some problems.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:20.120]  Roll them with the vehicles for support.
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:22.120]  Who are the terrorists?
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:23.120]  Who are the terrorists?
[1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:24.120]  Yeah.
[1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:25.120]  They got a faction in there.
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:26.120]  It's causing some trouble.
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:28.120]  Is that the orange?
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:29.120]  What's that?
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:30.120]  The orange group.
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:31.120]  You're green and they're orange?
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:36.120]  They're green for us.
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:40.120]  So basically, what's going on right now?
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:41.120]  The other forces can't handle it.
[1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  They're about to send you all in?
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:44.120]  Exactly, exactly.
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  One bot is going to be sending us in.
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:50.120]  And we're going to hit the last two buildings where the faction is going to be held at.
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:52.120]  And we're going to rush in there with our scouts.
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:54.120]  We're going to hit them hard, take them out.
[1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:57.120]  So you all are doing almost like a SWAT type city exercise.
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:52:58.120]  Right.
[1:52:58.120 --> 1:53:00.120]  So you're doing special weapons and tactics?
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:01.120]  Exactly.
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:02.120]  Just like police?
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:03.120]  Yeah.
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:05.120]  But with bigger, more firepower?
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:06.120]  Pretty much like SWAT.
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  We're going to go in, we're going to raid, we're going to hit them hard and we're going to pull out.
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:11.120]  So y'all are going in to kill?
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  This is right now, peacekeeping is going on right now.
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:14.120]  Y'all are going in to kill?
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:15.120]  Terrorists.
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:17.120]  Kill terrorists, right?
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:19.120]  Exactly.
[1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:20.120]  Wow.
[1:53:20.120 --> 1:53:22.120]  That's something else.
[1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:23.120]  Mike, let's come up there.
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  I don't know if I'm getting all this.
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  I saw some people being arrested and frisked and slammed down on the ground down there at the base.
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  What's going on there?
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:34.120]  They're probably most likely just giving up resistance saying we don't want help.
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:36.120]  They're probably pushing people around.
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:40.120]  Oh, so during the evacuation period?
[1:53:40.120 --> 1:53:42.120]  You can counter hostiles.
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:44.120]  So they forcibly take people to the camp?
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:46.120]  If they're being hostile.
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:50.120]  What about the folks that are wearing black and are opposing us police officers?
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:51.120]  What's their role?
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  I'm not sure.
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:55.120]  They are police officers.
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:59.120]  If you might acknowledge those are police officers from the Alameda Police.
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:00.120]  So they're police acts?
[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:04.120]  We have full support for this training operation from the Oakland Police Department, basically
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:07.120]  all the civic people here.
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:09.120]  Oh, I understand that absolutely.
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.120]  Marines are just training with the Alameda Police Department.
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:15.120]  That's more likely what's going on there, just to get used to working hand in hand with the police force.
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  That's a lot of what goes on in today's world.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:24.120]  What would you do if people in America were upset about getting their weapons taken away?
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  Would you guys ever go in and help the government take their weapons away?
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:30.120]  We don't have to have this.
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  I don't know.
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:32.120]  I won't answer that question.
[1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:33.120]  Okay.
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:34.120]  We'll turn the camera off.
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:38.120]  Well, that's Oakland, California, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:40.120]  Now let's go to some listening devices.
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  Cameras on the street corners and armored personnel carriers in the hands of your local police.
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  So, Officer, you're on the Austin City SWAT team?
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:49.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  What type of vehicle is this?
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  It's called APC, Armored Personnel Carrier.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  Armored Personnel Carrier.
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  Donated from the military, donate that, Jeff.
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:58.120]  Yeah, all the free goodies.
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  There's a lot more coming.
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  Don't worry.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  It works fine.
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:04.120]  Is this your Kevlar helmet?
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  Yep.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:06.120]  Pretty effective?
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  Yep.
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:08.120]  Can we look at it?
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:09.120]  Sure.
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  Boy, it almost looks like a German helmet.
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  Yeah, I think it's there.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:14.120]  I think they're actually military surplus.
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:15.120]  Yeah.
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:16.120]  So, we're going to point them back.
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  Police departments, from the smallest to the largest, all across the country, are receiving free military surplus helicopters,
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:29.120]  APCs, known as Armored Personnel Carriers, and much more.
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  A deadly trend that is expanding.
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  But it's not just armor that local law enforcement from state agencies to local police departments are getting.
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.120]  No, my friends.
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  It's listening devices.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  Of course, the excuse is to find the location of gunshots.
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:52.120]  But the designers openly admit it can also be used to listen to your conversations and triangulate your position.
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  Just consciously think about this for a second.
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  Listening devices.
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  And I almost forgot, in tandem with cameras, all federal funding.
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:04.120]  Repeat.
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  All federal.
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:07.120]  Armored Personnel Carriers.
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  Helicopters.
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:09.120]  Foreign troops.
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:10.120]  Practicing with local police.
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  With our military.
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:18.120]  And in Austin, Texas, and many other cities I've visited, I have noticed that many of the cameras aim into the neighborhoods.
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:20.120]  I'm not kidding.
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  Time and time again, they are not focused on the highways and byways, but into neighborhoods.
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  And then you've got the checkpoints.
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  Those can't be ignored.
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  Warrantless searches.
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.120]  Random searches.
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:34.120]  Can't be called American.
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  More akin to some foreign third world dictatorship.
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  Every day I see families.
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:42.120]  Black, white, Hispanic.
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  It doesn't matter.
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  Being pulled over.
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:45.120]  Being searched at random.
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  Police have requested to search my vehicle.
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  And in all of the four or five cases, I've told them no.
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  But once I had to get somewhere, so I said, you know what?
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:55.120]  Go ahead and search the vehicle.
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:58.120]  But you're thinking the media will keep you abreast of the situation?
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:03.120]  Well, my friends, you're looking at a FEMA control box.
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  That's right.
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  989 KJFK FM where I work in Austin, Texas.
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:12.120]  That, my friends, can take over the radio station.
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  It is radio controlled by a FEMA tower.
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:16.120]  That's right.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.120]  A FEMA tower in New Braunville, Texas.
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  It covers almost all of the central part of the state of Texas.
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:30.120]  Little teletypes come printing out of the side of the machine weekly and update us.
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  In the past, it was voluntary.
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:34.120]  Now it's mandatory.
[1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:37.120]  And they can remote control, take over the station.
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:41.120]  But again, I guess they've only got our best interest at heart.
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  They are the globalists.
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:47.120]  They are the people that know best and understand how the world needs to be managed.
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:49.120]  They would never hurt us.
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:50.120]  Well, that's funny.
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:58.120]  Why do they slaughter between 500, 800,000 people in Africa, in Rwanda, back in 94 through 96?
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:04.120]  Again, I guess they do know better than our own Congress, our own House and Senate how to run the nation.
[1:58:04.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  And if not, well, they'll just supersede the Constitution with executive orders that their puppet presidents will pass.
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:12.120]  They're the power.
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  They're the elite.
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:14.120]  They're the enemy.
[1:58:14.120 --> 1:58:22.120]  But even the United Nations and the World Bank and the IMF and the rest of this global gang of thugs are nothing more than puppets.
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  Puppets to the financial interests that control them, like the World Bank and the IMF.
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  Massive foundations, as we speak, according to the Washington Post, are moving forward to destroy the Second Amendment.
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:44.120]  People like George Soros pumping tens of millions of dollars a year into the movement to disarm the law-abiding traditions and give the despotic government free reign to enslave us.
[1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  Bill Clinton kisses mothers and gives weeping speeches, chiding how evil the gun industry is.
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:56.120]  The same gun industry that supplied the weapons that helped us defeat Hitler.
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:59:06.120]  Oh, and don't forget all the celebrities like Rosie O'Donald and Janet Reno, the butcher of Waco coming out and saying you should have to have a federal license to be able to have a gun.
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:10.120]  Sharon Stone saying she's giving up her right to keep him bare arms.
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  What choice words from the actress?
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:19.120]  And Spike Lee saying we should kill, quote, shoot Charlton Heston and dismantle the NRA.
[1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:27.120]  Funny, Spike, I thought you were for nonviolence. Why did you say we should shoot Charlton Heston with a 44 bulldog magnum?
[1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:29.120]  I'm having a lot of trouble figuring this out.
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:32.120]  Oh, I'm sorry. You're an elitist bootlicker, aren't you?
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:34.120]  But this is a global problem.
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:39.120]  In England, they're getting ready to restrict the right to a jury trial to most the population.
[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:48.120]  The U.S. is moving forward in joining the U.N. International Criminal Court with a tribunal, not juries, and the satellites are going up.
[1:59:48.120 --> 1:59:53.120]  And back to America with the thumb scanners, the retina scanners, the national ID cards.
[1:59:53.120 --> 2:00:02.120]  With your bank accounts, your insurance, your life history, all on one government-issued card, think of the power and control it's going to give them.
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:07.120]  And by the way, it's already being implemented in places like New Jersey or Texas.
[2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:09.120]  I'm not a criminal. What's this for?
[2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:11.120]  Then why do you need to mark him? Why do you need to...
[2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:13.120]  That goes right into the FBI.
[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:16.120]  Because Bill Clinton says I'm a criminal because we're standing up against this.
[2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:24.120]  Lest you think it can't happen to you, I simply spoke out against the thumb scanning that's going on in Texas, and I was taken to jail.
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:28.120]  And what happened to my cameraman of over five years, Mike Hansen?
[2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:30.120]  Now that's really sick.
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:32.120]  Mike Hansen, no criminal record?
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:36.120]  Veteran father of two, happily married for 15 years.
[2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:38.120]  Well, Mike paid the ultimate price.
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  He simply refused to let MJTF search his vehicle in a parking lot.
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  And so they busted out his window on him and his 11-year-old daughter, searched the vehicle, found nothing stolen,
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:53.120]  but that didn't stop him from taking him to jail, according to Mike, and beating him and torturing him.
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  And more all the story, America's in a police state. We better stand up and speak out and wake up the good police that are left out there.
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  Knowledge is power. That's as old as human history itself.
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  And our enemies know that.
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  They have most Americans and the rest of the world locked in a mind-numb stupor of false reality.
