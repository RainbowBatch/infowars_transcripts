[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:27.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. It is Monday, June 3rd, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the health
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.500]  ranger, billing in for Alex today, who is in the UK. He has successfully arrived there.
[00:39.500 --> 00:43.000]  They did not kick him out of the country, at least I haven't heard about it. If they
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.500]  did, and I'm sure we'd be the first to hear. So he's there getting ready for the Bilderberg
[00:48.500 --> 00:53.000]  Conference, and he's going to be joining us, in fact, in the second hour today, calling
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.500]  in. Also joined by David Icke in the second hour. In fact, today is a show that's just
[00:58.500 --> 01:05.000]  packed with great personalities. We've got Gerald Cilente hosting the third hour, and
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.500]  I'm just here for the first hour to get things rolling. So breaking news today, on Drudge,
[01:10.500 --> 01:15.500]  in fact, Drudge is linking to this right now. The US Supreme Court has ruled that police
[01:15.500 --> 01:22.500]  can take DNA swabs from arrestees. Just like taking your fingerprints, they can now take
[01:22.500 --> 01:27.500]  DNA. We're gonna talk about this during the first hour of the Alex Jones show here, why
[01:27.500 --> 01:29.500]  this is such a big deal.
[01:29.500 --> 01:35.000]  It means that the government can take your DNA, essentially any time they want, and enter
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  it into a database that will be used against you. Now, every power that we give to the
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.300]  federal government turns out to be used against us in ways that never could have been imagined
[01:46.300 --> 01:52.000]  by our founding fathers. So this is a very disturbing decision by the Supreme Court,
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.500]  and it was a sharply divided court that made this decision. There were four dissenting
[01:57.500 --> 02:03.500]  justices who said that the court was allowing police to have a significant change, a significant
[02:03.500 --> 02:06.000]  expansion in police powers.
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.500]  So we're gonna talk about that, but it turns out that your DNA, this is the big story really.
[02:10.500 --> 02:16.000]  Your DNA is now claimed to be owned by the federal government, and they can do anything
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.600]  they want with it. In fact, there have been cases still happening right now where medical
[02:20.600 --> 02:28.800]  science has ripped off the DNA of patients and used it to create cancer tumors that they
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.600]  use for experimental purposes to study anti-cancer drugs, and they never pay that patient any
[02:33.600 --> 02:37.000]  kind of royalty, and they don't intend to.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.500]  So we've got that story coming up. Also, the official Bilderberg attendee list has been
[02:41.500 --> 02:47.700]  released, and this is posted right now on Infowars.com. We've got the full list. We're
[02:47.700 --> 02:53.300]  gonna break down for you some of the big names that are on that list because it is a big
[02:53.300 --> 02:58.300]  deal. Remember, the Bilderberg Conference is something that was called a conspiracy
[02:58.300 --> 03:03.700]  theory just a few years ago. They said it doesn't exist, even though it does, just like
[03:03.700 --> 03:08.100]  the ammo purchases by DHS. It doesn't exist. It's a conspiracy theory that they're buying
[03:08.100 --> 03:12.900]  ammo, but they are buying ammo, but it's not for you. It's not to be used against you.
[03:12.900 --> 03:15.500]  That's the explanation now.
[03:15.500 --> 03:21.000]  In addition to that story, we've got this story, the Al Gore backlash, why environmentalists
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.700]  are celebrating rising CO2 levels, and to explain that later today on the show, I brought
[03:28.700 --> 03:34.200]  some science flashcards with me here, right there, to explain to you a little bit about
[03:34.200 --> 03:40.900]  the table of elements and why carbon dioxide is a nutrient, not a pollutant, why plants
[03:40.900 --> 03:46.100]  and forests and gardens need carbon dioxide. That's argon we're showing you right there.
[03:46.100 --> 03:51.100]  Let's find something else. Oh, hydrogen, yeah, isn't that wonderful? We're gonna go through
[03:51.100 --> 03:55.300]  a little bit of a science lesson, which I know you'll enjoy because it has pictures
[03:55.300 --> 04:00.000]  and flashcards. Just a little flashback to high school, yeah, your favorite time, science
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  class, right?
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.100]  Anyway, we're gonna explain all that right here on the Alex Jones show, and in addition
[04:05.100 --> 04:09.900]  to that, we're covering the other news that's breaking today. We've got two-thirds of Americans
[04:09.900 --> 04:16.100]  don't know if they will insure under Obamacare because, of course, Obamacare, which promised
[04:16.100 --> 04:22.500]  to make your health insurance more affordable, is actually making it more expensive, by far.
[04:22.500 --> 04:29.600]  In fact, Californians are expected to pay 146% more for their health insurance premiums
[04:29.600 --> 04:38.100]  under Obamacare, and other states are going to pay up to 400% more for healthcare, health
[04:38.100 --> 04:45.000]  insurance under Obamacare. Gee, it's called the Affordable Care Act, but no one can afford
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.660]  it. All that and much more straight ahead as we continue here on the Alex Jones show.
[04:49.660 --> 05:00.540]  Stay with us.
[05:00.540 --> 05:06.300]  Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with Supernatural Silver, a non-toxic

[08:08.500 --> 08:14.860]  Defending a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[08:14.860 --> 08:29.180]  GCN Radio Network. All right, it's Monday, June 3rd, 2013, here on the Alex Jones Show.
[08:29.180 --> 08:34.780]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today. Alex is in the UK, getting
[08:34.780 --> 08:42.060]  ready to break down the Bilderberg Conference. As a journalist, a news reporter, I don't
[08:42.060 --> 08:46.380]  mean break it down, I don't mean like bash the doors in. No, I mean he's there to cover
[08:46.380 --> 08:51.740]  it. And by the way, if you want to watch the live coverage here on InfoWars, just go to
[08:51.740 --> 08:59.620]  infowars.com slash B, as in Bilderberg. Got it? Infowars.com slash B is the website where
[08:59.620 --> 09:05.720]  all the live coverage is going to be happening. And Alex Jones is there. We've got other InfoWars
[09:05.720 --> 09:11.460]  reporters there. Richard Reeves is on location right now. Of course, Paul Joseph Watson,
[09:11.460 --> 09:16.840]  who lives there, is there. We've also got, I heard, Luke Rudowski is there covering it
[09:16.840 --> 09:20.880]  from We Are Change. And many other people, so expect a lot of interesting reports to
[09:20.880 --> 09:27.100]  come out of the Bilderberg Conference all this week. And infowars.com is the headquarters
[09:27.100 --> 09:31.340]  where you're going to get the most information on that, more than any other news source in
[09:31.340 --> 09:32.340]  the world.
[09:32.340 --> 09:38.300]  And by the way, we have the official Bilderberg attendee list. And it includes, this is breaking
[09:38.300 --> 09:46.460]  news, this is the attendee list was just released. It includes Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com,
[09:46.460 --> 09:52.440]  vice chairman of Goldman Sachs. Gee, we didn't expect that one, Michael Evans. The former
[09:52.440 --> 09:57.980]  Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner. Gee, there's another big unexpected name.
[09:57.980 --> 10:04.500]  The General of the US Army, David Petraeus. Yeah, I'm starting to see a pattern here.
[10:04.500 --> 10:10.320]  Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google. There's another big name and a lot of other names.
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.540]  But gee, according to the mainstream media, all these people are going to a meeting that
[10:14.540 --> 10:22.200]  doesn't exist. Gee, do you think Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt and General Petraeus would
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.860]  all go to a meeting that doesn't exist? Really? No, they're going to the Bilderberg meeting,
[10:28.860 --> 10:34.260]  which does exist, and it's not a conspiracy theory. It is a meeting of some of the most
[10:34.260 --> 10:40.820]  influential and powerful and maybe power hungry people around the world who are getting together
[10:40.820 --> 10:45.420]  to talk about how they're going to run the world, how they're going to influence the
[10:45.420 --> 10:46.420]  world.
[10:46.420 --> 10:51.060]  They're going to shape policy and control people and probably depopulate the planet
[10:51.060 --> 10:55.180]  has been one of the topics that's been talked about in the past, but certainly they want
[10:55.180 --> 11:00.900]  to own the planet. So probably the big topic this year, this is just my personal conjecture
[11:00.900 --> 11:05.700]  on the topic, is to figure out how can they crash the global debt markets in a way that
[11:05.700 --> 11:09.980]  transfers all the wealth from the hands of the working class into the hands of the ultra
[11:09.980 --> 11:15.700]  wealthy elite, who are primarily the people at the meeting? How can they make that crash
[11:15.700 --> 11:20.980]  happen so that it just crashes in their direction? That's probably the big topic, but we'll
[11:20.980 --> 11:21.980]  see.
[11:21.980 --> 11:26.940]  So watch Infowars.com all week long and listen to the Alex Jones show for updates on that.
[11:26.940 --> 11:32.500]  Now, big breaking news from the US Supreme Court just breaking this morning, in fact,
[11:32.500 --> 11:38.580]  and this is the top headline on Drudge this morning. Drudge says ruled, take their DNA.
[11:38.580 --> 11:47.860]  The US Supreme Court has issued a ruling that allows police across the country to take your
[11:47.860 --> 11:54.340]  DNA when they arrest you, to swab your DNA involuntarily on your part. They just take
[11:54.340 --> 11:59.020]  it from you essentially by force. In the same way that they take your fingerprints, they're
[11:59.020 --> 12:00.620]  now gonna take your DNA.
[12:00.620 --> 12:06.140]  Well, why is this a big deal? And why did four of the justices at the US Supreme Court
[12:06.140 --> 12:11.900]  have dissenting opinions warning about the expansion of police powers? This is a big
[12:11.900 --> 12:18.380]  deal because it essentially says that the US government claims ownership over your DNA.
[12:18.380 --> 12:23.660]  Now here's why that really matters. Number one, your DNA is unique and it's supposed
[12:23.660 --> 12:28.560]  to be yours, supposed to be private. It's part of your biology, it's part of your body,
[12:28.560 --> 12:33.420]  it's an intimate part of your body. Why can the government just take that from you? And
[12:33.420 --> 12:36.480]  if the government can take it from you, what can they do with it?
[12:36.480 --> 12:44.620]  Now here's where it gets really scary. You're probably aware of the gene hypothesis of disease,
[12:44.620 --> 12:50.060]  right? You've heard of Angelina Jolie having a double mastectomy because she carried a
[12:50.060 --> 12:57.720]  gene mutation called the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene, B-R-C-A1 and 2 genes that are associated
[12:57.720 --> 13:04.820]  with an increased risk of breast cancer. This hypothesis is wrong. Your genes do not determine
[13:04.820 --> 13:10.660]  your health outcome. They might have a 1% influence over your health. 99% of your health
[13:10.660 --> 13:15.340]  is up to you. It's based on what you eat. It's based on avoiding GMOs and avoiding fluoride
[13:15.340 --> 13:19.600]  and avoiding toxic chemicals and avoiding smoking and fried foods and all those things
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.900]  that you know are bad for you. Most of your health outcome is up to you, probably again
[13:24.900 --> 13:32.880]  99%. But the government has been saying that the genes determine your health outcome. Now
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.940]  here's the danger. What happens when they take your DNA because you're arrested? They
[13:36.940 --> 13:40.260]  put it in a government database, which is of course what they do with everything. The
[13:40.260 --> 13:45.980]  government loves to have databases on the people. And then they analyze your DNA and
[13:45.980 --> 13:51.780]  they decide, oh, you have a gene for mental illness. Then they use that information to
[13:51.780 --> 13:57.460]  take away your Second Amendment rights. That's right, a knock on your door. Hey, we're here
[13:57.460 --> 14:02.780]  to take your guns because when you were arrested last week, we ran a DNA analysis over your
[14:02.780 --> 14:09.060]  genome sequence, and we discovered that you have the gene for mental illness. Haha, the
[14:09.060 --> 14:13.120]  joke's on you. We're taking your guns. That's what the government is gonna do with this.
[14:13.120 --> 14:19.300]  Or even worse, they're gonna say, oh, you wanna sign up for Obamacare because you wanna
[14:19.300 --> 14:26.220]  pay 100 to 200, even 400% more for your health insurance than you used to pay because Obamacare
[14:26.220 --> 14:31.340]  is raising the rates on everybody around the country? Well, guess what? You're disqualified
[14:31.340 --> 14:36.900]  because you have a gene for breast cancer or you have a gene for liver cancer or you
[14:36.900 --> 14:42.460]  have a gene for sickle cell anemia, if you wanna get down that road. They can use this
[14:42.460 --> 14:48.820]  with a racial bias to take away your right to have basic healthcare, basic human dignity
[14:48.820 --> 14:54.700]  in a medical system that essentially respects no human dignity. By the way, they can use
[14:54.700 --> 14:59.580]  your genes against you. They can use them against you in a court of law. They can say,
[14:59.580 --> 15:03.740]  they take your children because they don't like the fact that you're not vaccinating
[15:03.740 --> 15:07.540]  your children or you're homeschooling your children to give them a real education instead
[15:07.540 --> 15:13.180]  of the watered-down, government-run public education system, right? So they take your
[15:13.180 --> 15:20.300]  children and then they arrest you, they get a gene swab, a DNA swab, they run the genetic
[15:20.300 --> 15:25.620]  code from that, and then they say, well, you have the gene of a bad parent, so you can't
[15:25.620 --> 15:30.340]  have your kids back. We're gonna take your kids because the state knows best. We're gonna
[15:30.340 --> 15:35.300]  take your kids and say you have a bad parenting gene. You see, this is the mythology that's
[15:35.300 --> 15:40.060]  so dangerous. They can say your genes are anything they want. They can say you have
[15:40.060 --> 15:46.340]  a gene for being a rebel. They can say you have a gene for being a patriot, which they
[15:46.340 --> 15:52.220]  now call terrorism. You have the gene for speaking out. That's dangerous to the government.
[15:52.220 --> 15:56.420]  Obama says you shouldn't listen to those voices. Maybe you should arrest those voices. Put
[15:56.420 --> 16:01.040]  them in jail because they've got the gene for speaking out. So basically, anybody who's
[16:01.040 --> 16:08.940]  got genetics that are part of humanity, you know, the will to live, the will to exercise
[16:08.940 --> 16:14.200]  free speech, the liberty gene, you might even say, if there is such a thing, they're gonna
[16:14.200 --> 16:20.120]  target that and target you because of your genetic code. This is a very dangerous precedent,
[16:20.120 --> 16:25.740]  and it will be abused. Mark my words here on this day on the Alex Jones show. My prediction
[16:25.740 --> 16:33.260]  is that this will be abused in highly destructive ways against the American people. So the Supreme
[16:33.260 --> 16:42.260]  Court has just sent us down a hellish path of abuse of police powers over our DNA. Now,
[16:42.260 --> 16:46.820]  on the DNA topic, and by the way, bringing back up Angelina Jolie, who continues to be
[16:46.820 --> 16:52.260]  in the media for her decision to have both of her breasts removed, even though they were
[16:52.260 --> 16:56.740]  perfectly healthy breasts, she did not have cancer. She just had a gene that's supposed
[16:56.740 --> 17:02.900]  to be linked with cancer. And I strongly criticize Angelina's decision. I didn't criticize her
[17:02.900 --> 17:09.020]  as a person. I don't know her. I can't really criticize her. I'm criticizing her decision.
[17:09.020 --> 17:16.300]  But the reason this is important is because right now, today, 4000 human genes are owned
[17:16.300 --> 17:22.340]  and patented by corporations and universities. Did you know that? 4000 of your genes. Now,
[17:22.340 --> 17:30.580]  the human body has about 20,000 genes. 4000 of those, or roughly 20%, are patented by
[17:30.580 --> 17:35.480]  someone else. What does this mean? It means you don't even own your own genetic code.
[17:35.480 --> 17:40.900]  You follow me on this? Somebody else claims to own your code. Who gave them that claim
[17:40.900 --> 17:47.780]  over your human body? Who gave them that right to claim they own it? The US government. The
[17:47.780 --> 17:54.080]  US Patent and Trademark Office gave them that claim. They handed out your genes to other
[17:54.080 --> 17:58.180]  corporations and universities. And what are those corporations and universities doing
[17:58.180 --> 18:03.580]  with that monopoly, that patent that they've been given by the US Patent Office? They're
[18:03.580 --> 18:10.060]  using it to charge you monopoly prices on the testing of those genes. That's right.
[18:10.060 --> 18:14.140]  So all those women who are listening to Angelina Jolie and are saying, well, gee, I should
[18:14.140 --> 18:20.740]  go get tested for the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene, they're having to pay 3000 to 4000 dollars
[18:20.740 --> 18:26.940]  out of pocket for a genetic test that should only cost 100 bucks. The reason it costs 3000
[18:26.940 --> 18:31.660]  to 4000 dollars is because you have to pay these monopoly royalties to a company called
[18:31.660 --> 18:37.500]  Myriad Genetics out of Utah that owns the patent on those genes because the US Patent
[18:37.500 --> 18:42.660]  Office gave them that patent. It's insane. And it's gonna be used against you. It's gonna
[18:42.660 --> 18:47.580]  be used against women, especially against women who are all freaked out about whether
[18:47.580 --> 18:49.220]  they have this breast cancer gene.
[18:49.220 --> 18:54.980]  It turns out 99% of them don't have it. So you have to test 100 women to find one who
[18:54.980 --> 19:01.020]  has it. So you're gonna spend $300,000 on this gene testing in order to find one woman
[19:01.020 --> 19:07.620]  who has one gene that only has about a 1% influence over her cancer outcome. That's
[19:07.620 --> 19:13.900]  insanity. That's a medical insanity, patent insanity, intellectual property insanity.
[19:13.900 --> 19:18.740]  And now the US government says we can take your genes anytime we want. Yeah, we pull
[19:18.740 --> 19:23.540]  you over. We can just swab your mouth. And if you refuse, guess what? We're gonna stick
[19:23.540 --> 19:27.980]  a gun in your face and make you do it or take you to jail and then make you do it there.
[19:27.980 --> 19:33.180]  They could take your DNA. They can assign ownership of your DNA to someone else as they've
[19:33.180 --> 19:39.380]  been doing. And they can use that against you over and over and over again. This decision
[19:39.380 --> 19:45.540]  by the US Supreme Court is a violation not just of human rights and civil rights. It
[19:45.540 --> 19:52.020]  is a violation of universal law. It's a violation of God's law if you wanna say it that way.
[19:52.020 --> 19:57.940]  It's a violation of basic human dignity and basic genetic privacy. It is wrong. And we'll
[19:57.940 --> 20:00.580]  be back. Stay with us.
[20:00.580 --> 20:07.020]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind. Burglars look for houses
[20:07.020 --> 20:13.120]  that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking
[20:13.120 --> 20:18.140]  someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great
[20:18.140 --> 20:23.400]  peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians
[20:23.400 --> 20:29.020]  will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home. Fake TV easily
[20:29.020 --> 20:34.420]  plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer. And they're so easy to use. You just
[20:34.420 --> 20:38.860]  plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs
[20:38.860 --> 20:45.260]  and downstairs. Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling
[20:45.260 --> 21:00.180]  877-5FAKETV or go to FAKETV.com. That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[21:00.180 --> 21:04.540]  Wouldn't it be nice to have one product that replaces more than 10, saving you space, time
[21:04.540 --> 21:10.000]  and money? HempUSA.org has a complete full spectrum vitamin mineral detox formulation

[21:37.600 --> 21:41.580]  taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[21:41.580 --> 21:44.980]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[21:44.980 --> 21:49.380]  a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary

[24:07.380 --> 24:17.940]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. All right, we're
[24:17.940 --> 24:22.500]  back. Welcome to the Alex Jones show. We're continuing here. By the way, in the second
[24:22.500 --> 24:27.940]  hour, we've got Alex joining us by phone from the UK where he's covering the Bilderberg
[24:27.940 --> 24:34.460]  Conference and check out all the latest videos and I think they've even got real time text
[24:34.460 --> 24:41.420]  messaging or at least articles at Infowars.com slash B. B as in Bilderberg. David Icke will
[24:41.420 --> 24:46.060]  be joining us in the second hour also with Alex Jones. It's going to be a really fun
[24:46.060 --> 24:51.140]  and interesting conversation. And then the third hour is going to be hosted by Gerald
[24:51.140 --> 24:57.500]  Cilenti. So Gerald happens to be my favorite guest here on the Alex Jones show. So I'm
[24:57.500 --> 25:01.500]  super excited that he's going to be hosting the third hour. And maybe I'll get to talk
[25:01.500 --> 25:05.700]  to him for a few minutes as we intro the third hour. But then I'm out of here and I'm going
[25:05.700 --> 25:13.420]  to do some special reports for the nightly news on the CO2 hoax, the carbon dioxide hoax,
[25:13.420 --> 25:17.580]  which we'll get into here in the next segment. But before we do that, let's break down some
[25:17.580 --> 25:25.140]  of the other news that's happening. Mayhem in the city, New York City, 25 people were
[25:25.140 --> 25:33.540]  shot in the last 48 hours. Gosh, that's almost one person every two hours. That's quite a
[25:33.540 --> 25:40.220]  lot of shooting for a city that says it's making you safe by taking away all your guns.
[25:40.220 --> 25:45.060]  Yet more proof that gun control doesn't work because, of course, only the criminals have
[25:45.060 --> 25:49.740]  the guns in New York City and Chicago and everywhere else that they try their gun control
[25:49.740 --> 25:55.580]  agenda. It just flat out does not work, period, does not work. You notice there's not a bunch
[25:55.580 --> 26:02.860]  of shootings like that in, I don't know, Central Texas. That's because everybody's armed, including
[26:02.860 --> 26:07.700]  myself, right now at this very minute, sitting here in the studio, carrying a Glock as I
[26:07.700 --> 26:10.540]  always do. Everybody's armed around here.
[26:10.540 --> 26:15.580]  That's not crazy shootings. People are actually pretty darn polite to each other when everybody
[26:15.580 --> 26:23.020]  knows they're carrying. So in other news, Infowars reporters confront Bilderberg's security.
[26:23.020 --> 26:29.020]  Paul Joseph Watson and Richard Reeves were confronting the hotel that canceled their
[26:29.020 --> 26:35.860]  reservations, apparently in violation of the 2010 Equality Act in the UK, which says that
[26:35.860 --> 26:42.000]  people cannot be denied, they cannot be discriminated against for their political beliefs. But the
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.740]  hotel appears to be discriminating against the Alex Jones crew precisely because of their
[26:47.740 --> 26:55.340]  political beliefs. This story is posted right now on Infowars.com. It's by Paul Joseph Watson.
[26:55.340 --> 27:01.460]  What is that video? Oh, it's a video of them at the hotel confronting the reception personnel
[27:01.460 --> 27:07.100]  there and asking why their rooms were canceled. Well, gee, we know why they're canceled because
[27:07.100 --> 27:13.780]  you're with Alex Jones. And we can't allow Alex Jones to exercise free speech in the
[27:13.780 --> 27:19.180]  United Kingdom. That would be a terrible, terrible thing. So the oppression has already
[27:19.180 --> 27:23.220]  begun at the Bilderberg Conference, and you can expect there would be more interesting
[27:23.220 --> 27:25.500]  stories all week long.
[27:25.500 --> 27:29.140]  Now, two-thirds of Americans don't know if they will ensure under Obamacare. I mentioned
[27:29.140 --> 27:34.300]  this in the last segment, but I have a few other comments here. Obamacare has been described
[27:34.300 --> 27:39.580]  as a train wreck. It's already derailed. It's running off the tracks. It's just a matter
[27:39.580 --> 27:45.740]  of time before the cars start stacking up and whatever explosives are being carried
[27:45.740 --> 27:49.020]  by the train start leaking out and catching on fire.
[27:49.020 --> 27:55.580]  This is a disaster. The state exchanges that are supposed to be running Obamacare can't
[27:55.580 --> 28:01.300]  even get their IT departments to work correctly. Most of the states that claim they're gonna
[28:01.300 --> 28:07.780]  have this by January 1 of 2014 are not gonna be able to do it. There are gonna be computer
[28:07.780 --> 28:13.740]  problems galore. If you think the DMV is a nightmare, wait until you try to sign up for
[28:13.740 --> 28:16.820]  the Obamacare exchanges in your state.
[28:16.820 --> 28:24.480]  That is gonna be an IT nightmare. I mean, just imagine, just the mess of all these overpaid
[28:24.480 --> 28:31.060]  government employees trying to figure out highly complex relational databases. They're
[28:31.060 --> 28:35.740]  probably gonna try to run the whole system on an Excel spreadsheet because they don't
[28:35.740 --> 28:42.220]  even know how to use databases. So it's gonna be a massive nightmare. And the whole thing,
[28:42.220 --> 28:46.980]  my prediction is it's all gonna fall flat on its face and Obamacare is eventually gonna
[28:46.980 --> 28:47.980]  be pulled.
[28:47.980 --> 28:56.420]  It's gonna be redacted. It's gonna be rejected after the 2014 elections. And certainly by
[28:56.420 --> 29:00.900]  the 2016 presidential election, things are gonna be so different by then. Hopefully,
[29:00.900 --> 29:06.720]  we will have Obama impeached by that time. We'll have Obamacare pulled out of US law.
[29:06.720 --> 29:12.460]  We'll have some liberty back in place. We'll have Rand Paul successfully championing the
[29:12.460 --> 29:16.700]  legalization of industrial hemp farming in America, something that he's just come out
[29:16.700 --> 29:22.100]  for, so that our farmers can get back to business making money again, planting a crop that has
[29:22.100 --> 29:23.600]  a multitude of uses.
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.820]  It's not about marijuana. This is industrial hemp, okay? You can't smoke it, but you can
[29:27.820 --> 29:32.820]  turn it into clothes and textiles and car parts and even seeds and oils and nutritional
[29:32.820 --> 29:37.300]  products. It's the crop for America. It's what we need right now. Go, Rand Paul. Get
[29:37.300 --> 29:42.100]  it legalized, okay? Thank you. Thank you for standing up for liberty. We love you. Keep
[29:42.100 --> 29:49.820]  it up. Stay tuned. This is the Alex Jones Show. We'll be right back.
[29:49.820 --> 30:01.460]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.460 --> 30:05.860]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[30:05.860 --> 30:10.940]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[30:10.940 --> 30:16.340]  your liberty, freedom, and security, and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[30:16.340 --> 30:21.860]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[30:21.860 --> 30:26.700]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries, but here's the most effective way
[30:26.700 --> 30:31.980]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight, government regulation. The do-it-yourself
[30:31.980 --> 30:38.100]  public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided. This,
[30:38.100 --> 30:42.460]  along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[30:42.460 --> 30:48.660]  control of food supplies and resources, says food is the ultimate priority. e Foods Direct
[30:48.660 --> 30:55.380]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[31:03.820 --> 31:09.140]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are
[31:09.140 --> 31:14.680]  committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[31:33.200 --> 31:38.060]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface. But rather, we have formulated
[31:38.060 --> 31:43.500]  our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate
[31:43.500 --> 31:51.340]  and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com

[33:03.900 --> 33:12.500]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[33:12.500 --> 33:19.780]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones Show. Thank you for joining us. This is Mike Adams,
[33:19.780 --> 33:26.060]  the Health Ranger editor of naturalnews.com filling in today. Alex and David Icke are
[33:26.060 --> 33:30.660]  going to be co-hosting the second hour. I'll be riding shotgun for that. And then in the
[33:30.660 --> 33:34.540]  third hour, Gerald Cilenti will be hosting the show. So we've got a great lineup for
[33:34.540 --> 33:40.240]  you today. We've already covered some fascinating news, but now I want to take you to a little
[33:40.240 --> 33:45.460]  science class here. Don't worry, it's not going to bore you and you're not going to
[33:45.460 --> 33:50.300]  get an F, huh? No, you're going to get an A because we're going to talk about the truth
[33:50.300 --> 33:55.460]  about science and atmospheric gases that they don't want you to know in the mainstream media.
[33:55.460 --> 34:01.340]  Specifically, we're talking about, well, greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide. And here in the
[34:01.340 --> 34:04.580]  studio, I brought some flashcards. Obviously, you can't see them on the radio, but if you're
[34:04.580 --> 34:09.860]  tuned in on prisonplanet.tv, you can see the flashcards. Now we've got elements here on
[34:09.860 --> 34:13.980]  the flashcards, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon, all with their atomic
[34:13.980 --> 34:19.080]  weights with pictures, cool pictures, isn't that awesome? Now, here's the myth, here's
[34:19.080 --> 34:24.800]  the delusion being pushed by Al Gore. He says that carbon dioxide, which is a combination
[34:24.800 --> 34:35.540]  of one carbon and two oxygen atoms, carbon dioxide, he says, is a pollutant CO2, is a
[34:35.540 --> 34:40.460]  pollutant, he says, and it's so deadly and so dangerous, it's going to destroy human
[34:40.460 --> 34:46.600]  civilization unless you pay him and his buddies some carbon taxes. So you got to pay him money
[34:46.600 --> 34:52.780]  and then you'll be okay. But let's talk about carbon dioxide and what's really in the atmosphere.
[34:52.780 --> 34:57.540]  It turns out that carbon dioxide has just surpassed a level of 400 parts per million
[34:57.540 --> 35:03.900]  in the, in Earth's atmosphere. 400 parts per million. Well, what does that mean, really?
[35:03.900 --> 35:09.260]  Is it high? Is it low? Because Al Gore wants you to think it's alarmingly high, it's terrible,
[35:09.260 --> 35:16.740]  it's atrocious, it's going to kill us. Well, 400 parts per million is 400 out of a million.
[35:16.740 --> 35:23.540]  So 400 parts per million is less than one half of one one-thousandth of the air. 400
[35:23.540 --> 35:30.500]  parts per million is so small, it's so minuscule, it is a trace gas in the air. It almost doesn't
[35:30.500 --> 35:35.420]  exist at all. And the levels in the past in Earth's history have been as high as 7,000
[35:35.420 --> 35:41.000]  parts per million. So 400 is very, very small. In fact, right now in this office, it's probably
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.220]  2,000 parts per million. In many offices or work environments, it can go up to 3,000 or
[35:46.220 --> 35:52.100]  4,000 parts per million. So 400 parts per million in the atmosphere is ridiculously
[35:52.100 --> 35:57.580]  small. At the same time, when you exhale, you're exhaling carbon dioxide, your breath
[35:57.580 --> 36:04.620]  can exhale as much as 40,000 parts per million carbon dioxide, which adds to the atmosphere.
[36:04.620 --> 36:09.020]  But you're not a polluter just for breathing, are you? That's what Al Gore wants you to
[36:09.020 --> 36:13.300]  think. And a lot of people are confused about this. A lot of people have been brainwashed.
[36:13.300 --> 36:18.480]  And I gotta admit, I was one of them. Yeah, five years ago, I was writing about global
[36:18.480 --> 36:24.580]  warming and CO2. I had fallen for the Al Gore argument. Well, I tell you what, I educated
[36:24.580 --> 36:31.540]  myself since then, and I can admit today that I was wrong about that, and that the CO2 myth
[36:31.540 --> 36:39.340]  is a complete hoax. It turns out that oxygen by itself is at a level in the atmosphere
[36:39.340 --> 36:46.620]  of 210,000 parts per million. You got that? So CO2 is only 400 parts per million. Oxygen
[36:46.620 --> 36:51.980]  is at 210,000 parts per million. And over here, nitrogen, you see this? Nitrogen is
[36:51.980 --> 37:00.020]  at 780,000 parts per million of the atmosphere. And then there's a little bit of argon in
[37:00.020 --> 37:06.900]  the atmosphere, and I include hydrogen in here because H2O, hydrogen and oxygen, creates,
[37:06.900 --> 37:10.340]  well, water vapor, and there's a little bit of that in the atmosphere as well. So what
[37:10.340 --> 37:15.020]  you're looking at here on these flashcards is most of what's in the atmosphere. Not everything,
[37:15.020 --> 37:20.980]  but most of it, by far, the majority. So we're supposed to be concerned about the CO2 being
[37:20.980 --> 37:26.020]  at 400 parts per million? Well, wait a minute. Some new science has just come out that says
[37:26.020 --> 37:32.940]  that as CO2 levels are rising, it's causing more plants to regrow and regreen desert type
[37:32.940 --> 37:40.300]  of areas, arid areas, all across the planet. They're regreening because of rising levels
[37:40.300 --> 37:45.260]  of CO2. Here it is in Science News. There's been a new study that was just published.
[37:45.260 --> 37:50.460]  It looked at CO2 concentrations, and as they're rising, which they are, I'm not saying they
[37:50.460 --> 37:55.740]  aren't going up slowly, they're rising, thank God, because they've been so desperately low
[37:55.740 --> 38:00.860]  for so long that the plants are starving for CO2, okay? So they're finally going up a little
[38:00.860 --> 38:06.540]  bit, and it's helping the forest and it's helping the trees. I gotta tell you, if you're
[38:06.540 --> 38:13.620]  an environmentalist, and I am, I'm a legitimate, true, libertarian environmentalist, I love
[38:13.620 --> 38:19.580]  the environment, I love plants, I love aquaponics, I love growing food from seeds, I love forests,
[38:19.580 --> 38:26.620]  I love CO2 because CO2 helps all of those things. CO2 makes forests grow back faster.
[38:26.620 --> 38:33.220]  It is the ultimate reforestation nutrient. It is a fertilizer, okay? CO2 is fertilizer
[38:33.220 --> 38:39.740]  from the air that helps deserts and arid areas and forests regrow forests and regreen. It's
[38:39.740 --> 38:45.440]  the ultimate nutrient that environmentalists should be supporting. But Al Gore's got these
[38:45.440 --> 38:51.060]  people all twisted up to where they're thinking that CO2 is a poison, and that if you're an
[38:51.060 --> 38:55.060]  environmentalist, you have to be against CO2. It's ridiculous. Now, by the way, just to
[38:55.060 --> 39:01.740]  clarify, just to clarify, because I know where people leap on this issue, I am not pro oil
[39:01.740 --> 39:08.460]  and pro gas and pro coal, okay? I'm not pro fossil fuels. And no, the coal industry didn't
[39:08.460 --> 39:10.060]  pay me to say any of this.
[39:10.060 --> 39:15.820]  In fact, coal is very dirty. Burning fossil fuels is dirty, all right? Now, coal can be
[39:15.820 --> 39:19.100]  made cleaner than it used to be. It's a lot cleaner here in the US than it is in China,
[39:19.100 --> 39:24.100]  for sure. But it's still, it puts sulfur into the air, it puts mercury into the air. Fossil
[39:24.100 --> 39:30.140]  fuels, oil, BP, spills it into the Gulf of Mexico, crimes against nature, Exxon, crimes
[39:30.140 --> 39:33.980]  against nature. These companies, I do not support them, all right?
[39:33.980 --> 39:39.020]  Just to be clear, just to be on the record, I don't support the fossil fuel energy industry.
[39:39.020 --> 39:45.920]  That's not my thing. But I do support rising CO2 levels as a way to regreen the planet.
[39:45.920 --> 39:51.300]  And this is where we've got to get our heads on straight. CO2 is such a powerful nutrient
[39:51.300 --> 39:57.800]  for growing plants that greenhouse owners actually pump CO2 into the greenhouses to
[39:57.800 --> 40:03.180]  boost production of the food plants there. Did you hear me on that? They pump CO2 into
[40:03.180 --> 40:09.180]  the greenhouses to boost productivity. If you wanna grow more food on the planet, you
[40:09.180 --> 40:11.280]  need more CO2.
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.700]  If you wanna reforest the areas where forests have been lost, you need more CO2. I'm not
[40:16.700 --> 40:23.020]  saying burn oil and put CO2 into the atmosphere. It turns out that ocean life produces most
[40:23.020 --> 40:30.020]  of the CO2 anyway, and that's enough. The ocean is exchanging CO2 with the atmosphere
[40:30.020 --> 40:35.940]  constantly. And just like we exhale CO2, ocean creatures are exhaling CO2 as part of their
[40:35.940 --> 40:36.940]  respiration.
[40:36.940 --> 40:44.180]  So CO2 levels, the higher they go, the greener our planet gets, which is why CO2 is the ultimate
[40:44.180 --> 40:51.060]  nutrient for environmental support of plants and trees and food and gardens, all right?
[40:51.060 --> 40:56.220]  So get it through your heads, folks. I know a lot of people, I mean, I did an article
[40:56.220 --> 41:02.060]  on this on natural news yesterday, and some people were still screaming at me. Well, like
[41:02.060 --> 41:07.260]  one of the comments, this is the dumbest comment ever from a Facebook troll, was in my article
[41:07.260 --> 41:11.300]  when I said, let's celebrate rising CO2 levels because it's good for plants, it's good for
[41:11.300 --> 41:12.660]  food, it's good for trees.
[41:12.660 --> 41:19.500]  The dumbest comment ever was, stop being so negative. Yeah, can you believe that? Stop
[41:19.500 --> 41:23.940]  being negative? What do you mean? I was being positive. I was celebrating CO2 levels. They're
[41:23.940 --> 41:27.400]  going up. It's good for nature. It's good for plants. It's good for food production.
[41:27.400 --> 41:33.900]  It's good for trees. And it doesn't hurt us. Actually, your breath has 40,000 parts per
[41:33.900 --> 41:39.040]  million CO2. If you can save another person's life by breathing that into them through mouth
[41:39.040 --> 41:42.780]  to mouth resuscitation, they will come back to life.
[41:42.780 --> 41:48.100]  You're breathing oxygen and carbon dioxide into them from you. Carbon dioxide doesn't
[41:48.100 --> 41:52.960]  hurt them, even at that high level for that short a period of time. In fact, OSHA has
[41:52.960 --> 41:59.380]  set a limit in a workplace of 5,000 parts per million, more than 10 times the current
[41:59.380 --> 42:03.700]  level of CO2 that's in the atmosphere. You can work in an office environment, you can
[42:03.700 --> 42:08.300]  breathe just fine at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, even 5,000 parts per million.
[42:08.300 --> 42:12.720]  Not a big deal. Not a big deal. So I just couldn't believe that comment. He stopped
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.380]  being negative. Actually, it's Al Gore is being negative. Al Gore is the doom and glimmer.
[42:18.380 --> 42:21.820]  He's the one that's saying, we're all gonna be destroyed, human civilization is gonna
[42:21.820 --> 42:27.900]  end if the CO2 level goes up and they get greenhouse gases and the planet's gonna fry
[42:27.900 --> 42:30.440]  and you have to pay him money to solve the problem.
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.180]  That's doomsday talk, okay? That's doom and gloom right there from Al Gore. I'm being
[42:35.180 --> 42:41.340]  the optimist. We are the optimist. We're saying CO2 levels going up, that's great. That's
[42:41.340 --> 42:44.460]  great for the plants. It's great for the trees. It's great for food production. We can produce
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.620]  more food, feed more people.
[42:46.620 --> 42:51.340]  We can turn deserts into forests. We can turn arid areas into forests. We can regreen the
[42:51.340 --> 42:59.600]  planet thanks to CO2. So that's a wrap up of that little science lesson. I hope this
[42:59.600 --> 43:06.260]  gets posted on YouTube. I wanna see the comments on there to see. It really sets apart people
[43:06.260 --> 43:12.540]  who are intelligent, rational thinkers versus those who are just delusional cultists who
[43:12.540 --> 43:17.220]  believe in the Al Gore cult of CO2 being evil, all right?
[43:17.220 --> 43:23.540]  It's a very clear litmus test for your IQ basically. And like I said, I admit I failed
[43:23.540 --> 43:30.180]  that test many years ago and I was suckered into the whole global warming thing. It takes
[43:30.180 --> 43:34.940]  a lot to admit you were wrong and change your opinion, but I think that is a sign of someone
[43:34.940 --> 43:37.700]  who actually thinks about what they're saying.
[43:37.700 --> 43:42.380]  Sometimes we change our minds. I changed my mind about Adam Kokesh by the way. At first
[43:42.380 --> 43:46.540]  I was like his March on Washington, which has now been sort of expanded into 50 states,
[43:46.540 --> 43:51.460]  I was like, that's the worst thing ever, I think it's a terrible idea. Then I rethought
[43:51.460 --> 43:55.380]  the thing and I said, Adam Kokesh, he's got a point, he's got a point.
[43:55.380 --> 44:01.720]  The most dangerous thing is sitting at home doing nothing. So I support activism. I don't
[44:01.720 --> 44:05.820]  necessarily support the speech saying it's gonna be an armed overthrow or anything like
[44:05.820 --> 44:09.100]  that. I don't think we need to go there. I agree with Alex on that point. Let's fight
[44:09.100 --> 44:15.500]  the info war first. Let's not whip out the rifles and start flying lead downrange to
[44:15.500 --> 44:20.740]  make our point. Let's use words instead. Because we're winning on the words. We're winning
[44:20.740 --> 44:27.020]  on the mathematics. We just talked about mathematics in the atmospheric gases and science. We're
[44:27.020 --> 44:33.300]  winning on the mathematics of economics. Austrian economics is winning. We're winning on so
[44:33.300 --> 44:35.900]  many fronts that we should just keep the info war going.
[44:35.900 --> 44:40.500]  But if we are ever wrong, if we come to the conclusion that maybe there's new information
[44:40.500 --> 44:45.780]  that comes in that contradicts our previous opinion, then we gotta be man enough to change
[44:45.780 --> 44:52.460]  our opinion and admit, yeah, we learned something new. We're changing our stance on something.
[44:52.460 --> 44:56.400]  We gotta be man enough to admit that and then move forward from that point forward.
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.860]  And I'm not saying I'm 100% correct on everything right now. There might be things that I changed
[45:00.860 --> 45:06.300]  a few years down the road. But I do know these are elements from the table of elements. Carbon
[45:06.300 --> 45:11.460]  dioxide is not a pollutant. I know that. I mean, unless you're on a space station or
[45:11.460 --> 45:16.060]  something and then if you're on a space station, then yeah, CO2 is a pollutant because it's
[45:16.060 --> 45:21.260]  gonna build up in the air. You gotta have scrubbers to remove it from the air. CO2 scrubbers
[45:21.260 --> 45:26.420]  is why they have them on spaceships. But on Earth, we got enough plants to balance that
[45:26.420 --> 45:31.180]  out. So it's not a pollutant. It is a nutrient. That's the point of all this.
[45:31.180 --> 45:37.900]  All right, so enough said on that point. Let's go to the next big news item. Gotta get this
[45:37.900 --> 45:42.180]  in before we go to David Icke and Alex Jones in the next hour. Check this out. South Korea
[45:42.180 --> 45:50.420]  joins the Japanese ban on US imports or imports of US wheat after the shocking GMO contamination
[45:50.420 --> 45:57.340]  announcement by the USDA. Gonna cover this very quickly. Here's the deal. The USDA tested
[45:57.340 --> 46:03.180]  commercial crop fields, wheat fields in Oregon and it found that they were contaminated with
[46:03.180 --> 46:08.340]  Monsanto's genetically engineered wheat, which was only used experimentally planted across
[46:08.340 --> 46:15.340]  16 states in the United States from 1998 to 2005. This genetically engineered wheat has
[46:15.340 --> 46:20.140]  never been approved by the government for commercial use and it has never been intentionally
[46:20.140 --> 46:26.100]  grown in any commercial farm. What this means is that the genetically engineered wheat escaped.
[46:26.100 --> 46:32.580]  It escaped the experiment. It got loose, all right, and it spread to other farms and other
[46:32.580 --> 46:37.940]  fields and it's now being found in wheat where it's not supposed to be found. Now, Japan
[46:37.940 --> 46:42.460]  got word of this and said, hey, we're canceling our contracts, bud. We're not gonna buy that
[46:42.460 --> 46:47.700]  wheat from the United States because it's contaminated with GMOs and we here in Japan,
[46:47.700 --> 46:53.520]  we don't wanna eat GMOs. Well, South Korea just joined in on Friday, said the same thing.
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.220]  We don't wanna eat GMOs either. We don't want that Monsanto contaminated wheat. We're not
[46:57.220 --> 47:02.260]  buying wheat from the United States. Why is this a big deal? Think about it. If you're
[47:02.260 --> 47:07.860]  a US wheat farmer, you just got screwed by Monsanto big time because now the wheat prices
[47:07.860 --> 47:13.620]  are gonna collapse in the United States through no fault of your own, only through the fault
[47:13.620 --> 47:19.980]  of Monsanto, whose GMOs are contaminating wheat crops causing prices to go down because
[47:19.980 --> 47:24.260]  it's being rejected by other countries all around the world. Most of the world doesn't
[47:24.260 --> 47:30.980]  wanna eat GMO. Most of the people don't wanna eat GMO. GMOs are rejected by everyone except
[47:30.980 --> 47:38.460]  Monsanto and a few members of Congress who are in Monsanto's pocket and the corrupt USDA
[47:38.460 --> 47:43.620]  and that's it. Everybody else rejects it. So if you're a farmer and you're growing wheat,
[47:43.620 --> 47:50.460]  now you're gonna suffer an economic loss because of Monsanto's experiments gone awry. Because
[47:50.460 --> 47:55.100]  of that experimental crop grown in the open air with no protections that didn't even grow
[47:55.100 --> 47:59.940]  it in a greenhouse. All right, this is open field. Let's see what happens. Let's play
[47:59.940 --> 48:05.460]  genetic roulette, to quote Jeffrey Smith's book, with the entire agricultural system.
[48:05.460 --> 48:12.120]  So now we've got, check this out, thanks to the USDA conspiring with Monsanto to legalize
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.940]  these open field experiments, we've now got a situation where we have genetic pollution,
[48:17.940 --> 48:24.500]  polluting the fields of America's bread basket. Now we've got wheat and we've got corn and
[48:24.500 --> 48:30.900]  we've got alfalfa and probably other crops that are contaminated with GMOs. And you can
[48:30.900 --> 48:35.100]  never put that back in the box. You can never take that back.
[48:35.100 --> 48:41.620]  So is our wheat crop now ruined permanently, where other countries aren't gonna import
[48:41.620 --> 48:49.260]  US wheat ever? Hopefully not. Hopefully they'll find a way to still buy US wheat. But it could
[48:49.260 --> 48:56.380]  be that bad. It could be that bad. And this is why it's important for all of us to recognize
[48:56.380 --> 49:03.700]  that Monsanto is hurting farmers. Monsanto is destroying the integrity of the United
[49:03.700 --> 49:10.380]  States agricultural system. It is destroying the economic productivity. Monsanto is hurting
[49:10.380 --> 49:17.120]  US exports. Monsanto is hurting the GDP of the United States of America.
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.300]  It's time all of you out there woke up and smelled the coffee on this issue and realized
[49:22.300 --> 49:27.940]  that Monsanto is bad for America. It's bad for farmers. It's bad for your food. It's
[49:27.940 --> 49:36.340]  all around bad news. And now the proof is in the exports. Japan says no, South Korea
[49:36.340 --> 49:44.500]  says no. That's it. You're done. No more wheat being exported. All right, let's move on to
[49:44.500 --> 49:52.700]  US news here. We've got an Oregon man flying American flag upside down to protest the Obama
[49:52.700 --> 49:53.700]  presidency.
[49:53.700 --> 49:56.820]  I'm gonna go through a few of these headlines here very quickly while we have time. Hey,
[49:56.820 --> 50:04.200]  guys, awesome. You upgraded to color printouts. That's pretty cool. All right, the State Department
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.780]  says there's no active Al Qaeda or Hezbollah terror cells in the western hemisphere. Oh,
[50:09.780 --> 50:15.780]  really? What about the ones running the US government? The Intel chair, this is in the
[50:15.780 --> 50:20.260]  weekly standard, chair of the Intel, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
[50:20.260 --> 50:23.140]  says release the bin Laden documents.
[50:23.140 --> 50:28.500]  The Bradley Manning court martial trial starts today. The trial is dangerous for civil liberties,
[50:28.500 --> 50:34.340]  say, experts. Soldier faces charges of aiding the enemy by downloading and leaking hundreds
[50:34.340 --> 50:39.820]  of thousands of classified documents. He's called a hero to his followers, an enemy of
[50:39.820 --> 50:47.340]  the state to others. It's three years after his arrest. And a man molests and urinates
[50:47.340 --> 50:52.780]  on a woman in the ER, says police. That's out of New York. Yeah, just another sign of

[54:17.180 --> 54:23.260]  Welcome back. This is the Alex Jones show here on GCN and Alex is in the UK. He successfully
[54:23.260 --> 54:27.260]  arrived there to cover the Bilderberg conference that's going to be happening all week with
[54:27.260 --> 54:32.820]  Paul Joseph Watson and others. He joins us by phone now to give us the report of his
[54:32.820 --> 54:36.900]  travels and his arrival. Hey, Alex, you're on.
[54:36.900 --> 54:40.800]  Thank you so much. Thank you so much for sitting in and doing a great job on the broadcast
[54:40.800 --> 54:48.700]  for natural news and from full wars. Obviously, Bilderberg doesn't kick off till Thursday,
[54:48.700 --> 54:55.460]  but the things that are happening here politically, their agenda just being released today, the
[54:55.460 --> 55:00.660]  list of attendees just six, seven years ago, they didn't do that. And even then they would
[55:00.660 --> 55:06.580]  just send to one big newspaper of a big stink got made the list of government officials
[55:06.580 --> 55:11.020]  that were there from around the world. Now they put out the whole list and the agenda
[55:11.020 --> 55:13.900]  three days before it officially starts.
[55:13.900 --> 55:19.560]  We had that first today because Charlie Skelton of the Guardian alerted us even before the
[55:19.560 --> 55:26.460]  Guardian posted it, that it is up on the official Bilderberg meetings site. We now have the
[55:26.460 --> 55:33.220]  agenda and a breakdown of that as well as the full list up on info wars.com. And again,
[55:33.220 --> 55:39.100]  for new listeners listening on AM and FM stations, you may be saying, why cover some group of
[55:39.100 --> 55:41.180]  politicians royalty elite?
[55:41.180 --> 55:46.500]  Well now it's about 150 members. There's a lot of them that aren't on the list every
[55:46.500 --> 55:52.060]  year. We're here to identify them. That's always the key people. And we have moles very
[55:52.060 --> 55:57.360]  close to Bilderberg and we're able to learn the agenda for the year coming up. These people
[55:57.360 --> 56:03.100]  brag and released the BBC about four years ago, the fact that they helped found what
[56:03.100 --> 56:04.980]  became the EU.
[56:04.980 --> 56:08.780]  These are the people setting up the new world order. These are the people behind the carbon
[56:08.780 --> 56:14.860]  taxes as in 21. Last year when I was in Chantilly, Virginia at Bilderberg, a gentleman showed
[56:14.860 --> 56:21.580]  up with the National Archives. I'll just leave it at that. And he said, this isn't classified,
[56:21.580 --> 56:24.860]  but he said, if you've got the waivers you can post it, it is restricted.
[56:24.860 --> 56:31.100]  And it was marked on each one restricted National Archives of a US Senator's papers and some
[56:31.100 --> 56:35.340]  other internal Bilderberg documents. So it was his papers from meetings there in the
[56:35.340 --> 56:41.100]  50s and 60s. And everything they talked about, they then got done within a decade. And so
[56:41.100 --> 56:48.880]  it's royalty, it's all of them getting together with energy ministers and others with the
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.380]  heads of the big power companies to then decide who's gonna be able to operate, who's gonna
[56:53.380 --> 56:54.980]  be shut down.
[56:54.980 --> 57:00.460]  It's the ultimate backroom deals. And it is a giant victory that people now know that
[57:00.460 --> 57:04.580]  Bilderberg even exists. I mean, just four years ago, as I've talked a lot about, the
[57:04.580 --> 57:09.020]  New York Times did a film review on the film New World Order and basically said that I
[57:09.020 --> 57:14.460]  was insane and Bilderberg didn't exist. And I was in Virginia, again, five years ago when
[57:14.460 --> 57:17.780]  they had the event, but this was in their newspaper four years ago when that film came
[57:17.780 --> 57:19.740]  out, imagining it.
[57:19.740 --> 57:24.260]  So it's a big defeat to them. First, they said it doesn't exist and you're all kooks.
[57:24.260 --> 57:27.540]  There's nobody above presidents and prime ministers. The buck stops there. There's no
[57:27.540 --> 57:31.820]  secret of special interest, blah, blah, blah. Because Bilderberg members have been indicted
[57:31.820 --> 57:37.780]  and gotten in trouble before, like Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands in Lockheed Martin's
[57:37.780 --> 57:43.500]  taxpayer scams, buying jets for more money than they were worth as getting kickbacks.
[57:43.500 --> 57:47.180]  Let's say a jet's worth 2 million. Well, he'd buy them for 5 million a piece and get a million
[57:47.180 --> 57:52.820]  bucks out of the 3 million extra. That's the type of stuff that they do on a small fry
[57:52.820 --> 57:58.900]  scale. It's much, much bigger. So that's why this is so huge. That's why this is so important.
[57:58.900 --> 58:01.940]  Think about the victory we've had, folks. All of us should be savoring this to realize
[58:01.940 --> 58:03.100]  we can have victory.
[58:03.100 --> 58:07.580]  These are just humans just like us. They're not God. They're not invincible. They wanted
[58:07.580 --> 58:13.140]  to deny this existed for decades and now they're forced to admit it. They go, okay, but so
[58:13.140 --> 58:18.180]  but it's no big deal. Is that why over 2 million pounds or close to 4 million dollars is being
[58:18.180 --> 58:21.900]  spent to erect a giant steel fence? We're going to videotape tonight.
[58:21.900 --> 58:25.140]  We've got to go to break here, Alex.
[58:25.140 --> 58:26.140]  Okay, great.
[58:26.140 --> 58:30.260]  Okay, so we're going to break, folks. Stay with us. Alex Jones and also David Icke joins

[59:49.140 --> 01:00:05.260]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:12.340]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:21.620]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:26.820]  All right, welcome to the second hour. This is the Alex Jones Show. Alex continues to
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:33.740]  join us live by Skype and he's going to be here for much of this second hour. We've got
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:38.300]  David Icke coming in later in the hour and then in the third hour, Gerald Cilenti is
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:43.380]  hosting again, my favorite guest here on the show. And Alex, as I turn it over to you,
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.540]  I know your focus is Bilderberg, but I'm just wondering if you would comment on the big
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:54.740]  Drudge Linked story today, the US Supreme Court saying that police can take your DNA
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.920]  anytime they want.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.620]  It's horrible news. It's the way the whole world's going because the establishment wants
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:08.300]  authoritarianism. The people running things have openly said, Bilderberg has said, the
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:13.220]  Trilateral Commission has said, the Rand Corporation has stated, we should talk about that more
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.260]  after the break and get David Icke's take on that.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.220]  They just want to set the precedent to do whatever they want, whenever they want and
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:29.140]  shut down the free press because the system is becoming so inequitable, so fraudulent.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:33.580]  We've got big fat special interests that are able to shut down their competition, able
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:38.540]  to transfer most of the wealth for themselves, their government, corporate welfare and bailouts.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.020]  And then you've got a giant dumbed down mass of people that eat GMO and watch TV all day,
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.340]  who will go along with it, but then you've got maybe 30% of us, conservatively worldwide
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.880]  or more, that actually are starting to wake up to what's happening and aren't going along.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:59.100]  So it's when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, it's gonna be a nuclear
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:04.820]  explosion or an atomic reaction. Politically, historically, for every action, there's an
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:10.340]  equal and opposite reaction. So as evil rises, good rises, and this is the process.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:16.240]  I really had an epiphany last night flying in on that 10 hour flight from Dallas, Texas
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:23.860]  into London. I've got to say I'd never seen the PBS special by Stephen Hawking on the
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:28.240]  nature of reality. And do we have free will or not? And of course, they ended up at the
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.560]  show saying we obviously do have free will.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:38.260]  But expanding on that, it is our job to be tested. That's what this planet's all about
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:43.340]  in the middle of space. There's no doubt every culture has known this at their core. And
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.200]  it is our job to decide whether we support negative energy, destructive energy, parasitic
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.540]  energy or, and I'm not trying to be new age here, I'm just saying, but just boiling it
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.220]  down to its most simple physics or whether we support things that are of a higher order,
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.740]  things that build, things that construct.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:06.260]  Are we based on fraud or are we based on lies? And so there is tyranny galloping forward
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.620]  worldwide because of all the cosmologies out there. And there's different forces in this
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.500]  world, different forces of good, different forces of evil, different passive forces.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.100]  I hate to get philosophical here, but the main driving evil force is technocratic. It
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:24.980]  is scientific and it believes in survival of the fittest. And it believes that dumbing
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:31.380]  us down and then killing us is an act of righteous dominance. But in the process, the globalists
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.980]  are destroying the planet and themselves.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.760]  And it's really twisted. I mean, really, they're just a bunch of bullies who enjoy hurting
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.260]  innocent people. But when we come back briefly, as we go to David Icke, I will tell you my
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.140]  experience getting into the country because they interrogated me for 15 hours in Canada.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:52.540]  So they weren't going to let me in until a bunch of press showed up, thanks to Jim Tucker
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.840]  calling the CBC and others and local newspapers, then they got scared and released me.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.140]  I believe they weren't going to let me into England, who's blocked Michael Savage and
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:04.980]  many others, except for the fact that I made the point, this will just be bigger news if
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:11.020]  you don't let me in. We got into the cube. Well, I'll tell the story when we come back.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:16.500]  It's just that they definitely had extra people up there with us and they were making a decision
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.500]  on whether or not we were going to be let into the country because everybody else was
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.360]  just flying right through and some things happen there.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.620]  So I'll finish up with that. But this is a big deal that we can be here, that we can
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:35.540]  cover this. And that now Bilderberg is admitted in all over German, British, Dutch newspapers,
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:39.580]  some U.S. newspapers. But now they've got to make jokes about it. I know it's just a
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:43.840]  bunch of elitist meeting in secret. What's the big deal? Well, we're here to expose what
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.820]  they're doing, the men in the smoking room. And again, Mike Adams, I want to thank you
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:53.460]  for co-hosting and being traffic cop today. David Icke is coming up with Mike Adams, Alex
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:05:01.680]  Jones and more. I'm coming to you live from Bilderberg 2013.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.100]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:11.180]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:16.560]  your liberty, freedom and security. And that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:22.100]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.940]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.700]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do it
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:37.740]  yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:42.740]  This, along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:48.900]  control of food supplies and resources, says food is the ultimate priority. E Foods Direct
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:55.780]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:27.580]  Alex Jones. Welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams filling
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:32.460]  in with Alex, who's joining us via Skype from the UK, where he just arrived. He's going
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:38.100]  to tell us that story in a minute about how the the extra scrutiny was applied to him
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.420]  arriving there because of the Bilderberg conference. But Alex, I gotta I gotta tell you, when I
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:48.640]  walked in the studio today, I saw this this infidel armor, and I have it on the desk here.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.420]  It's awesome. It's got Molly attachments. I mean, I normally don't, you know, plug your
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:58.340]  sponsors, but this is I'm glad you had the sponsor and this body armor looks really amazing.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:03.020]  I I'm impressed by it. Well, it's funny that you bring that up because I do need to plug
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.920]  our great sponsors that have helped finance this trip to come cover the global shadow
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.820]  government and we're about to go talk to David. I come only gonna be here for about 20 minutes
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.340]  so that David can get in a word in edgewise. And I really look forward to meeting him in
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:21.500]  person on Friday. And hopefully we'll get him in studio with us during the show Friday,
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:26.420]  US time, Friday evening, British time, UK time.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:32.140]  But David Ick is about to join us. I saw his impassioned letter last week when they were
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:40.500]  talking about not letting anybody have a permit to have a rally on, you know, city property,
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.660]  private property, you name it. But but letting the Bilderberg group, you know, have their
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.660]  criminal events.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:49.660]  We're gonna have David Ick on with us here in just a minute. But yes, Infidel body armor,
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:55.220]  just amazing body armor. They also have the bulletproof backpacks that are so popular
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:10:02.340]  and they're a great sponsor and they're patriots. And you can go to infidelbodyarmor.com, infidelbodyarmor.com
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:09.540]  or give them a call 1-888-608-6605, 888-608-6605.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:17.020]  And also financing the real press, exposing Bilderberg, getting in their face, bringing
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.540]  out the real agenda from decades ago. Them saying it didn't exist till five, six years
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.980]  ago having to admit it exists, but still saying it doesn't matter if world leaders meet in
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:32.660]  secret. Financing that is of course, infowarsstore.com and all the best products are there like the
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.180]  probe here water filtration, we're still running the special.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:43.220]  The biggest special ever, 15% off with promo code WATER15, WATER15. You can go there.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.260]  We're gonna sell out of the traveler, stainless steel gravity fed filters very soon. The others
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.740]  are gonna sell out. I said it would run till June 9th, the end of Bilderberg. I can't say
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:56.020]  it's gonna continue, but a few days probably because they are selling out, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.020]  this has happened before.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:07.420]  We did a 15% off. So WATER15 is the promo code at infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.720]  On this body armor, just real quick comment. Everybody I know who's a prepper is running
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.580]  a chest rig like this or some kind of body armor like this. The thing is, you can run
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:21.060]  it as a chest rig without the plate and just to carry things. I mean, even as a farmer
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.140]  or a gardener, you can carry because it's got all the molly attachments and it's got
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:28.220]  the ATAX pattern of camo. And then you can put the chest plate in if you need to, if
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.420]  there's riots or gangs, looting or whatever.
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.380]  So it's dual purpose. I've got stuff just like that.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.740]  And I know you're one hell of a farmer and a prepper, man. I mean, you're out there doing
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:41.800]  it with your cows and your goats and everything else, doing a great job. Again, Mike Adams
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:48.260]  of naturalnews.com is riding shotgun. Gerald Cilente is going to be giving you a trends
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:54.740]  in the news update for about 50 minutes in the third hour. I want to go to David Ike
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.740]  of davidike.com.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:00.660]  I want to thank everybody that's made exposing Bilderberg possible. David Ike has exposed
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:05.780]  it for 20 years with people saying it didn't exist. Jim Tucker that died about a month
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:10.740]  ago, he exposed it for about 35 years, the real trailblazer. I've been exposing it for
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:17.380]  18 years. Sites like davidike.com, naturalnews.com, infowars.com and the biggest in the last six
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:23.760]  years drudgereport.com. Drudge was the only big outlet in the US other than Infowars that
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.860]  would put it on his site when we covered it and foreign press like the Guardian covered
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:33.220]  it, forcing the Washington Post after 50 plus years of attendance, the Graham family would
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.220]  admit it exists.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.660]  So that's the big issue. They don't want you to know there's something above presidents
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.340]  and prime ministers. And Bilderberg is right up there at the top of the pyramid. And now
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:47.460]  it's merging with Google and the technocracy that David Ike has talked so much about. And
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:51.820]  so I want to do a couple things here. I want to get David's take on A, how they're acting
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.300]  like we the media and the demonstrators that are coming.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:13:03.660]  Like we're dirty and we're bad and then GS security coming out and G4S security coming
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:09.580]  out, this big globalist outfit and saying, the only place you're allowed to have press
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:15.420]  in Watford. In fact, they're saying on the city sidewalks and this rural countryside
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.860]  area that the hotel's at, that no one's allowed to walk on the sidewalk or on the grass and
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.740]  that citizens have to show their ID.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:29.980]  This is in the newspaper, the police chief and the county sheriff as well. They'll have
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:34.820]  to show your ID to walk down the street or drive a car. They've got checkpoints set up.
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:42.180]  This is martial law. And I've talked to the head cop liaison and he says, he's a listener
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.420]  and does particularly like what's going on, but I'm not going to say much more and I won't
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.420]  get him in trouble.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.220]  I don't think he's playing good cop, bad cop. He gets that he's compartmentalized as David
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:55.100]  Ike has said, here are the people protecting this and oppressing the people while they
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:59.260]  themselves are being oppressed and destroyed. So I want to get his take on that that made
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:04.940]  him so angry in a letter that we published on info wars.com last week or earlier.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:11.340]  No, no. Yes, it was last week. I'm a bit jet lagged folks. Sorry. Haven't had any sleep.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.300]  And then I want him to get into why they're emerging with Google because we have inside
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.060]  moles. That was a big story we broke two weeks ago. That's why they don't want us in the
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:24.860]  hotel days ahead and threw us out because Google is meeting there now and for a week
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:29.300]  after and it's almost a permanent command base. Turns out they hatched a bunch of world
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.280]  war II OSS stuff there.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.700]  Turns out they hatched the Arab spring there. This Watford compound is key and as a transhumanist
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:41.500]  skeleton merging with a machine, climbing out of a reflecting pool in the back. So without
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:46.220]  further ado, I want to thank David Ike for being such a big part of this. He can bring
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.580]  out six, 7,000 people easily. And so if that many show up, they're going to make it hard
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:56.340]  next, but you got to do it. This could bring down Bilderberg politically by forcing it
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.500]  out into the media.
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:01.940]  If they miscalculate, if the police abuse anybody or if the security people do, that
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:08.260]  will backfire. I believe we have these guys by the short hairs. David Ike, again, former
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:14.260]  head of the Green Party, champion goalie, BBC sports reporter, and of course best selling
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:18.960]  author. And say which one about David Ike, he gets people thinking, David Ike, what do
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.480]  you make of how historic this year is? And do you disagree with me that this is a key
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.660]  time and a key opportunity here outside of London?
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:37.540]  Well, I think it is. I think we are looking at an historic moment in terms of the history
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:45.740]  of exposure. And you know, when I went to Alex, coming from England and knowing the
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:53.500]  geography and the location and all that stuff is, what on earth are they doing meeting in
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:16:00.020]  that hotel in Watford? I mean, they must have a very good reason for it because from a protest
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:07.780]  point of view, they're 30 minutes by train from central London. They're a short journey
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:15.820]  in a car, really, from the second biggest city in England, Birmingham. The East Midlands
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:23.020]  cities, which are just up the motorway, they're actually at a place where so many people,
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:33.900]  they're in the middle of a vast, vast population area. And so either they miscalculated or
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:39.340]  they hope they'll cause trouble and do a problem reaction solution, or there's another
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:45.380]  reason why it has to be that hotel. Because what they've done is create a situation
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:52.060]  in which the people, instead of having to go to them, they've almost come to us. You
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:17:01.740]  know, in 1995, Alex, the great, great Jim Tucker did a round robin email saying that
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:06.740]  the Bilderberg meeting was a place called Burgenstock in Switzerland. And as coincidence
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:11.220]  would have it, I was staying with some friends about two hours away at the same time, though
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:18.980]  I didn't know that when I agreed to go. So on the day before, I went across there
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:25.540]  down the two hours down the motorway, freeway, and I went up to three enormously flash hotels
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:31.020]  at the park, the palace and the grand. At the top of this mountain, it was basically
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:37.660]  in the middle of nowhere. And there was just not much more than a village down the bottom
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:43.560]  of the mountain. And I saw them putting up the temporary fences, I saw the people walking
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:52.220]  around with their name tags on. And there was no one around protesting. I mean, Jim
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:58.740]  was there somewhere, but I didn't need him. And then I went back on the last day of the
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:05.940]  Bilderberg meeting that year, 1995, and I wanted to see if I could get closer when it
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:11.580]  was going on. I couldn't even get on the mountain. Right down the entrance onto the
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:16.820]  mountain road from the village, there was the Swiss police, the guys had, I remember
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.440]  them, big orange, luminous jackets on. And I said to them, you know, I just want to go
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.220]  up to the hotel. They said, oh no, no, you can't, there's something going on. And
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:31.740]  I asked the guy, you know, so what is it, mate? Playing the idiot? Why can't I go on?
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:35.860]  What's going on? And he just said to me, I don't know, but it's top secret, top secret,
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:41.980]  he said. And I sat there and I thought, that's compartmentalization for you. You, a guy that
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:47.620]  the people at the top of that mountain are conspiring to manipulate your life, your children's
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:53.340]  life, your grandchildren's life, and you are protecting them when you don't even know they're
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.780]  there and the agenda that's happening. By the way, David, we're going to skip this,
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.420]  we're going to skip this network break because I got to you a little bit late. We're going
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:05.060]  to skip this break. This is the perfect example of everything you're talking about. Please
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:14.500]  continue. And so it's going to be quite, quite emotional, I think, very likely when I come
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:20.500]  up there because having stood at the bottom of that mountain and saw just nothing in front
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:27.220]  of me, and couldn't even see the hotels are so far away, here we are now, looking in their
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:36.220]  face. And I do urge as many people as possible to come along in total peace, and I'm sure
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:45.220]  that's what the vast majority's intent will be. But let's make a massive statement by
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:53.620]  numbers that we are not having this anymore, and that we are starting to figure out what's
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:20:03.740]  going on. And this is such a wonderful opportunity for massive exposure. You've got the media
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:10.820]  now â€“ you know, I do have to laugh â€“ you've got the mainstream media. We're now covering
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:18.300]  it and often making fun of the alternative media. The media, overwhelmingly â€“ in fact,
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:25.260]  if you go back to 1995 when Jim Tucker was the trailblazer, the media entirely that will
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:31.860]  be there covering this event would not be there this weekend if it wasn't for the alternative
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:36.940]  media, if it wasn't for the Jim Tuckers. They trailblazed this when no one else wanted
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:41.500]  to know, and the media were just laughing and ignoring it.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500]  And David, David, isn't this â€“
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:49.940]  And Jim trailblazed it, and the mainstream media have had to follow us, and they better
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.380]  get used to it, because it's only just started.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:57.060]  No, no, I totally agree, and that's where I was going. In my gut, in my intellect, in
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:04.620]  my spirit, at every level, this is a microcosm of the entire world, the entire universe of
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.740]  what's happening, and I want you to elaborate on that in Mike Adams, who's writing Shotgun,
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:14.700]  to pop in with any of his views on this, because here is Westbrook Pegler covering this 60
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:21.420]  years ago, not even knowing its name. Tucker picks it up 36 years ago, and it wasn't until
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:26.660]  a decade ago that really even Foreign Press would cover it, and now it's â€“ I talk to
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:27.660]  people on the airplane.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:33.060]  They know what it is, even if they don't know who David Icke is or Alex Jones. So again,
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:38.020]  this shows our power, the people's power, that they've gone from a stone wall, doesn't
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.980]  exist, there aren't two billion bullets, there aren't armored vehicles, there aren't NSA
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.140]  check spying on you, there isn't a new world order, we're not putting cancer viruses in
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.540]  the vaccines, we're not giving you GMO to kill you, to where we were all on the airplane
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.980]  flying here last night.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:58.260]  And I was talking to people, they're going, Henry Kissinger wants a new world order, and
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:02.460]  he's scum, and GMO's designed to sterilize us with chemicals in it. And I'm going, do
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:07.060]  you know who I am? No, who are you? And I'm telling you, David, people are either getting
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:11.380]  more zombie, or they're getting more awake, and I think it's coming to recrescendo.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:17.140]  And as you just said, their arrogance â€“ by the way, I read this two weeks ago, and then
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:21.620]  looked it up, and it's true, this is on some weird ritual site that had a stone circle
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.100]  at it before they built this palace that royalty would have parties at, and then they brag
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:30.620]  on the side of the thing that people have been coming here to party and mate for 6,000
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.940]  years. So it is some type of weird power site for them.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.580]  But just interjecting, I totally agree, this is historical, this is the Bilderberg meeting
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:43.860]  to be to, folks. This is it. This is where we force the global shadow government out
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860]  in the open. David, I...
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:50.860]  Well, you know, what I was saying earlier, Alex, about why have they held it here in
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:55.900]  that great population area, and I kept saying, oh, some other reason. Well, that's what I
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:04.060]  was talking about when I said that. You know, the Bilderberg group is very, very significant.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:12.420]  But it is a strand in a gigantic web, and you go much deeper in the rabbit hole than
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:20.060]  the Bilderberg group to find the source. And from that comes a deep knowledge of the nature
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:27.060]  of reality, the nature of the Earth's energy field, the fact that everything is conscious,
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:32.100]  and if you can do things to the Earth's energy field, you can affect the collective
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:38.460]  consciousness of everyone, because at the energetic, electromagnetic level, we are interacting
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:42.940]  with the planet, we're interacting with all energetic fields. And this is why they're
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:52.740]  constantly doing their rituals, and they do select Bilderberg meetings based on this,
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:58.080]  and this is a classic example. So in many ways, when you look at it from that point
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.020]  of view, there was only one place they were going to come, which is there for energetic
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.460]  reasons. This is what you find and understand when you go deeper in the rabbit hole. And
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:13.420]  when you get down there, you also realize that there is a reason or an explanation for
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:20.580]  the apparent blatant contradiction between a network of families and secret societies
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:27.500]  who are systematically dismantling the planet, and the fact that they have to live here.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.980]  I mean, this is not the time to go into it, but they want to change the planet into a
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:36.640]  different state that suits something. And that's what's so crazy is that they tell
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.020]  us all day we wanna kill the Earth, and then they say they're the saviors, while they're
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:47.820]  the ones on every front, GMO, chemicals, you name it, actively trying to not even play
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.500]  a good god, but to play a destructive, ugly god.
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.080]  And David, expanding on that, even if other people don't believe in the occult and things,
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:02.140]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove, I have covered Skull and Bones. You said that Savelle was
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:08.380]  running kids to the royal family 15 years ago. Now it's come out, the guy was this total
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:13.580]  Satanist. And for those of us that aren't like these people, we're blind to it, because
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:19.620]  we can't see into that dark spectrum that they inhabit, that they operate in, and expanding
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:23.820]  on that, that's why they've been so scared of exposure.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:29.580]  Because as you said, Bilderberg was just one uncovered part of, say, a temple out in the
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:34.140]  Sahara Desert, one little piece sticking up, and they said, oh, that's not part of a temple.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:38.820]  Don't go dig over there. And we started digging like archaeologists and are now digging and
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:43.580]  finding this giant submerged structure. Is that a good analogy?
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:51.620]  Well, yeah, we can think of huge things together here. First of all, understanding that these
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.460]  people at the Bilderberg Group, I'm looking through the list in front of me that is set
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:26:00.300]  to be coming this year, they look rich and powerful people. And on one level, they're
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:06.260]  rich and powerful people. But in the greater scheme of the global network, they are gophers.
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:12.140]  And they are terrified on one side of those much deeper in the rabbit hole, because this
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:17.540]  is a whole edifice of fear that they're caught in. And on the other side, there's still massive
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.220]  compartmentalization. And a lot of the people there will know some of the picture, but they
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:29.860]  won't know all of it. And these people who are really in the know, they worship these
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:37.420]  gods. They've been talked about in every culture for eons under different names. And they interact
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:42.600]  with these gods. And what I'm talking about gods, I'm talking about non-human entities.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:51.180]  And they are seeking to change the planet to suit them. This is why they are using GMO
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:56.980]  and goodness knows how many other methods to change human DNA, which is why they're
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:02.780]  doing the genetic modification of animals and plants and all the rest of it. They are
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:09.140]  seeking to turn this planet into something that is right for them. This has been an ongoing
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.140]  thing for centuries.
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:14.900]  Well, let me say this. I mean, they are publicly, as you know, in all their publications saying
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.980]  they're a different species than us. We're animals, they're God, and that they're going
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:24.880]  to transcend and merge with machines. And so again, just from a news perspective, whether
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:31.080]  it's true or not, when I was at Bohemian Grove, they were worshiping. They are occultist.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.380]  They believe this is real. And I want you to come back and get into whatever you want
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.660]  with Mike Adams, because I'm going to leave you, David, so that you can have some time
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.300]  here. You're going to be in studio with us sometime on Friday during the show, Friday
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:47.140]  evening, British time. I think we were talking during the break. You're good for that, correct?
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.020]  Yeah, I'll see you Friday.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:53.380]  All right, fantastic. But let me ask you this question as we get ready to go to break. You've
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:58.340]  got a few minutes here. Specifically though, calling out the trips, because you're huge
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.900]  all over the world. I have a big audience here in the UK as well, but you're really
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:08.420]  probably biggest here in the UK, where you can get 7,000, 8,000 people out at an event.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.700]  What do you think people should do? What are points you think that they should be making?
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:16.180]  I mean, we don't really talk about talking points, but what do you think the most important
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.420]  message is to get out here?
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:25.860]  Well, I think the biggest message is numbers. If we get a very large number of people turning
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:31.820]  up at this event, I mean, what we've just discussed, Alex, this is what we're looking
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:40.420]  at here, is absolutely unprecedented. The way that it's set up and that we could actually
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:47.060]  get in to the grounds and stuff like that. Yes, the security will be ludicrous and, you
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:52.380]  know, just so over the top. I mean, the people that run the world are insane. I mean, that's
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:56.220]  the penny that needs to drop before you start understanding the world we live in. They're
[01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:04.980]  great. But if we calmly and peacefully assemble in large, large, large numbers, I mean, even
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:11.420]  focus it on the Saturday when when when people are not working. And let's make a statement
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:17.420]  in numbers that people, including the mainstream media, just numbers, just numbers cannot ignore.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:23.420]  You see, this is the thing you see, what you're talking about on the train. The people, vast
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:28.780]  numbers of people now are far more aware of the world they live in than the journalists
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.460]  who are reporting the world. Let's come back. Let's come back and talk about that with David
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.660]  Eichem. David Eichem, writing shotgun for Mission Control in Austin, Texas, is Mike
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:42.380]  Adams of NaturalNews.com. And I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com. This is historic. I've been
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:50.160]  telling my crew that we all need to recognize the fact that huge, positive things are happening.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:30:00.780]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:08.180]  into why, even though I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:13.220]  my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:18.380]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:24.100]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:29.860]  fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:34.940]  there and discovered Younggevity. The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:40.180]  nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:24.420]  All right, we're continuing now on the Alex Jones Show. Thank you for joining us. Alex
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:31.500]  Jones and David Icke are both joining us by phone and Skype, reporting live from the UK
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:36.700]  and also to both of you guys before I turn it over, Alex, when you're done, when you
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.740]  want to turn it over to me, I want to keep David Icke on the air. I've got more questions
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:42.980]  for David if he's available to take some more questions.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:48.520]  Absolutely. He's with us for the rest of the hour. I'm going to get out of here right now.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:53.580]  Of course, I'm jet lagged, but now I've got total energy once I got on air. It's just
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:58.620]  that I'm going to let you and David now take it from here and then you can ask any questions
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:03.500]  you've got of David. It's just that listeners know this about me. I don't hype something
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:09.940]  up unless I really believe in it. And this is so huge and historical what's happening
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:17.380]  that I don't feel like I am properly imparting to people how big this is, the awakening that's
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:25.700]  going on. And one of two things happened. I got in to UK border, to customs and the
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:31.140]  EU citizens, that's the Brits under the EU, they all went right through, but myself and
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:34.620]  hundreds of others went and got in line for about an hour and everybody was just going
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.820]  instantly through.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.720]  Nobody was getting stopped. People were just straight through. They let you get a ticket
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.460]  here and then you're usually let right in. But when we got up there, three extra women
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:49.820]  came over, men lined up behind the counter, myself and Leanne McAdoo. This didn't happen
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:54.420]  when Richard flew in the day before, Richard Reeves. And they all lined up and were looking
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.460]  at us and were making a decision and then she interrogated us probably four or five
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.860]  times longer than they did other people.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:07.940]  And they were looking for some technicality like Canada did one time, saying, who's paying
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.580]  you to be here? And I said, I told you, I'm a media person and they all knew who I was.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:16.780]  That was clear as hell, people lined up waiting for something. And then they said, okay, and
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.460]  she reluctantly stamped it and I got in.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.900]  In the past, Jim Tucker has been blocked out of countries and then he's got to go to another
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:29.300]  country in Europe to get back in. In the past, Daniel Estlund has been blocked. In the past,
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:34.700]  I've been blocked. And so the fact that they didn't block me showed that they do not want
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.020]  a lot of press attention, which is exactly what they're getting.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:43.620]  You're seeing, no exaggeration, three or four times the coverage we saw last year. Last
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:48.180]  year was three or four times the coverage we saw the year before that. It is exponential.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:52.740]  So I wanted to ask David Icke in closing, and I'm going to throw the interview over
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:55.740]  to Mike Adams and David.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:36:03.300]  Again, just how historical this is, what he thinks Bilderberg is thinking, and what he
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.420]  thinks the establishment is going to do to strike back because humanity is waking up.
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:13.820]  And then I'll be back tomorrow live, hosting probably an hour and a half or so with David
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820]  Knight.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:22.420]  We're going to have live video feeds, live audio feeds, text, chat, all of it. As stuff
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:29.300]  breaks, we'll have live feeds that then get archived at infoawards.com forward slash Bilderberg.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:34.460]  And I want to ask listeners and viewers, even if you can't come to this event in England,
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:37.620]  because I understand it's a great expense, believe me, it's hard for us to come and bring
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:39.900]  this crew in.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:44.660]  It is so important that you spread the word about the demonstrations and about the press
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:51.100]  and that you write articles yourself or blurbs or you do YouTube videos about what's happening.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.780]  So David, that's my final question for you. And then I'm going to turn the show for the
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:37:00.220]  rest of the hour over to you and Mike Adams. David Eich, how important is it for people
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:06.120]  around the world to talk about this on the internet and to watch our video streams, listen
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:13.020]  to our audio streams and give this attention and focus on the resistance?
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:20.740]  Well, it's a simple situation really. That which wishes to be secret, that which works
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:26.660]  in the shadows, that which wishes to keep what it's doing secret from the public, then
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:32.020]  the antidote for that is the opposite. It's making what they're doing as public as possible.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:40.540]  And we've reached the point, we have reached this critical point where people in enough
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:47.340]  numbers are starting to see it, that the difference is starting to cause a shift. Because once
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:52.420]  you have a certain number of people that know something, then that number of people tell
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:57.060]  another number of people. Then now you've got a bigger number of people and they tell
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:03.260]  people from their level of awareness, much greater numbers, and the exponential curve
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:08.820]  starts to turn towards the sky. And this is where we are now. We're at this point where
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:16.100]  they can't keep it secret anymore. And the experience you've described at the airport,
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:20.300]  I've had that in different airports around the world. I've had it in Australia where
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:26.740]  they try to think of a way in exactly the same way. How can we think of a credible way
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:32.940]  of not letting this guy in? But then they go, well, hold on a second. If we do stop
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:38.900]  the fella, it's going to cause more publicity for what they're doing than if we just let
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:46.780]  him in. And so if you, it's like I said on my website, when they decided that they were
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:54.940]  going to have an area for people at this Bilderberg event. Look what happens when you won't take
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.260]  no from the system. This is what we must understand is the power of humanity.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:02.980]  But David, you've got to tell them what you did. You've got to tell them what you did
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:07.300]  though. You look at the number of people who are almost certainly going to turn up this
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:13.500]  weekend and you look at the number of people in the hotel at the Bilderberg event, they
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:20.500]  will be far more turning up to make their feelings known than people in that hotel.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:27.660]  Now think that the people in that hotel, tiny number, are making decisions and manipulating
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:34.060]  and coordinating events that are going to play out as change in policy all over the
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:40.820]  world. This is not the tail wagging the dog. It's not the tail wagging the elephant. It's
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:46.420]  the tail wagging the planet that we're looking at. We have to realize that when we start
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:53.500]  to understand the power we have in numbers, the power we have when we say, no, we're not
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.260]  out of it, then, then the house of cards will come down because that's what it is. A house
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:05.780]  of cards, which we are holding together by our ignorance and our, by our acquiescence.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:11.400]  We're starting to remove the ignorance. Large numbers of people are starting to see it.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.740]  Now we have to remove the acquiescence and show ourselves in numbers that the game is
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:22.260]  up. This is, this may not be, this may not be the end. It's nothing like the end, but
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:27.060]  as Churchill once said, it may perhaps be the end of the beginning. And I think it is.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.620]  It's the end of this stage where we've been building up to this point where there's enough
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:37.540]  awareness now, gathering all the time, that we can go on to the next stage. And that is
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:42.020]  dismantling this bloody nonsense and bringing an end to it. Because these people, these
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:46.900]  people, these, these, these, these powerful people on this list in front of me, they're
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:52.860]  little boys in short trousers. That's what they are. Pathetic little people playing little
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:59.180]  games with the lives of the population of the world. And we say enough, it's over. And
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:05.220]  we can make a mighty statement this weekend that enough is the point we've reached.
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:09.180]  All right. Mike Adams, you take it over. I want to thank all of you. I want to thank
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.980]  the crew because I'm punching out now. And I want to thank all of you, the listeners,
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:17.660]  our affiliates, everybody. I just have a real feeling of thankfulness to everybody that
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:20.860]  loves Liberty that we've gotten to this point. And we're not hyping this folks. This is a
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:25.420]  big deal. Mike Adams, you take over till five after with David Icke, then Gerald Cilenti
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.700]  is coming up. And again, ladies and gentlemen, all the news at info wars.com, four slash
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:33.820]  Bilderberg, David Icke.com, and of course, naturalnews.com.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.440]  But again, just amazing. I'm going to turn it over. Mike, you bring up some wildcard
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.560]  questions here for David Icke. And I'll see everybody back tomorrow on the show. Alex
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.260]  Jones signing off for now back to David Icke.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:50.240]  You bet. Thank you, Alex, for that live report. And David, yeah, it's an honor to be able
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.900]  to speak with you. You probably know I'm a big fan of you and your work, but it's a real
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:42:00.380]  pleasure to talk to you for the first time. I got to be a first with Alex, me and Alex
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:06.200]  at a few days. So, yeah, we all come together because this is what we need to do. Absolutely.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.360]  And you know, I've read all your books and I've watched your presentations. And in the
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.080]  context of Bilderberg, here's here's my opening question for you on this. You know, you talk
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:20.160]  about the nature of reality. You talk about the interaction between consciousness and
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:26.860]  reality. When we look at Bilderbergers, they are, in essence, engineers of illusion. They're
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:32.260]  trying to fabricate a reality that the people then must exist in, like in The Matrix. So
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:37.160]  I'd like you to speak to that role of the Bilderberg members of being sort of engineers
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.720]  of illusion and how we can see through that illusion and awaken to reality.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:51.000]  Well, this is a massive question, but this is an area that, you know, I think everyone
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.080]  in the area of alternative media and people looking for answers to what's going on in
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:03.160]  the world, we really do need to get this deep and deeper to understand the true nature of
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:09.800]  what is going on. Because if we stay only in the realm of the five senses, then we're
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:15.520]  staying on the movie screen. We're not actually exploring where the movie's coming from.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:22.160]  And if you go deep, deep in the rabbit hole, you're looking at entities â€“ I'll call
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:27.680]  it a force â€“ which is talked about using different names all over the world, in all
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:37.420]  the ancient cultures, and very manipulated human genetics in total, and specifically
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:42.480]  manipulated human genetics to create particular hybrid bloodlines, which are representing
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:48.960]  this force in our reality. We call these bloodlines the Illuminati families. They're the ones
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:57.520]  that sit on top the banking system, the governments, the corporations, and all the rest of it.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:05.080]  So what you're looking at is these rich and powerful people, so-called, they are representing
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.460]  this hidden force. In their rituals, they are interacting with this force. This is what
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:20.400]  Satanism is. And so, they understand that what we're living in is not a physical reality
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:27.120]  â€“ that's the illusion â€“ it is a holographic reality, illusory reality. And if you look
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:34.560]  at how holograms, you know, simple holograms you buy in the shops are made, the basic information
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.640]  that creates the hologram is not what you see as an apparently three-dimensional image,
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:46.080]  it's actually information on a waveform print. And then you fire a laser at the waveform
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.880]  print, which looks just like a fingerprint, really, when you see them in close-up, and
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:57.600]  suddenly that laser activates information that gives the illusion of a three-dimensional
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.860]  figure or image, whatever the holographic film has been taken of, and the best of them
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:11.200]  can look as solid as you and me. Now, but, you see, the hologram only exists because
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:17.720]  of the information on the print. And the nature of what the hologram is, whether it's a
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:26.280]  person or a box or a ball or whatever, is dictated by the information on the waveform
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:33.440]  print. So they know, because this is how our reality works, that what we think of as the
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:41.480]  physical world is just a holographic projection from information fields, waveform information
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:47.160]  fields, beyond the frequency range of human sight. But we can feel it, we feel this energy
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:51.440]  all the time, ooh, got good vibes, ooh, got bad vibes, all the rest of it. And so it's
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.720]  at that level, Mike, that they're manipulating our reality. They know that, well, what's
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.120]  the point in manipulating the hologram? The hologram's just a projection of something
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:06.120]  else. It's the something else they want to manipulate. And, therefore, they do these
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:13.160]  endless rituals. And a lot of them are absolutely in public sight, like the pomp and ceremony
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:20.120]  of the royalty in Britain, you know, all the marching soldiers and royal rituals and all
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:27.680]  this stuff. These are all manipulating energy. And when you get deeper into it, you realize
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:34.560]  that they've created, basically, a constant ritual that we call human life, in which if
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:44.960]  they can manipulate us, for instance, to feel fear, to feel anxiety, to feel stress, anger,
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:52.520]  and frustration, then that generates an energy, because everything's energy. And you are
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:47:01.840]  pouring that energy into the Earth's energy field, magnetic field, and that is affecting
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:11.440]  the field in its entirety, because, you know, you've only got to see what they found when
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.440]  you had the 9-11 attacks.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.480]  Yeah, they were feeding off all that fear.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:23.280]  They were picking up changes in the Earth's energy field, Earth's magnetic field, despite,
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:29.400]  at the time of the attacks, when the public became globally aware of it, was absolutely
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:36.120]  fantastic. And that was caused by the human collective emotional reaction to those attacks.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.240]  Now, this is what they're manipulating, and this is why, like I say, they'll do
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:48.200]  their ritual, which is what this Bilderberg thing is all about. So, what the long-term
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:55.720]  story of this is, is that over a vast amount of what we call time, these entities hidden
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:05.440]  from human sight, outside of the human visual range, through their network of hybrid families
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:14.240]  in this reality, have been changing our planet, changing the reality, changing the atmosphere,
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.800]  changing it genetically in the ways I was just talking about. The GMOs, it's what
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:27.280]  it's all about. Remember, it's not just GMO of human beings and GMO food, it's
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.920]  the genetic modification of the entire natural world. They're having genetically modified
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:37.520]  grass and lawns now, they're bringing in everything. They want to genetically modify
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:45.160]  everything, because the atmosphere and the planet that these entities can stand and therefore
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:51.280]  can interact with as they can't now, is very different to the one that is good for
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:55.320]  humans, and that's what we're seeing. And this is why there is, when you understand
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:49:02.000]  this, this is why there is no contradiction between these people who are manipulating
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  events in the world to destroy it from a human point of view, while at the same time they
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.960]  appear to be living in it. Well, why would they destroy their own world? Well, they're
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:18.920]  not like us, that's the point. And the key that really connects Bilderberg here and
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:28.240]  Google is transhumanism, which is not transhumanism at all, it's dehumanism, it's dehumanization.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:38.680]  The more that you can turn someone from a consciousness into a machine, which is like
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:45.120]  a computer, it can have the power of thought, the power of decision making, but it's not
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.600]  actually conscious in the greater human sense. The more you can turn them into machines and
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.440]  fuse them with the machines, the more power you have over them and the less power they
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.280]  have, because their energetic power, their power of consciousness, is constantly being
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:06.160]  eroded by the machines, the technology that they're being fused with. So you look at
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:14.840]  Google, and Google is absolutely there and has been from the start to lead this fusing
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:24.040]  of technology with humans. I have this thing I call the totalitarian titto, where you start
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.160]  at A and you know you're going to the lead and you go in steps, because you don't want
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:32.000]  to go too big or people might say what's going on. And you look at what Google are doing.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.600]  This thing, Google Glass, you know the computer on the...
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.160]  Yeah, the wearable computer, yeah.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.000]  ...and stuff like that. All this stuff going on at this secret laboratory, Google X and
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.320]  all the rest of it, it's all connected to fusing and fusing people and fusing people.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:50.120]  Hey, David, we're going to break. Sorry to cut you off there, David, but we're going
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.800]  to break. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break, and we'll continue with
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:59.360]  David Icke from davidicke.com. Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:05.400]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:11.000]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:17.740]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:22.840]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. Ninety-seven percent of Americans
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:27.200]  don't have this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.520]  the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:36.620]  mob is right outside your door. But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:39.720]  between life and death for you and your family.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:45.880]  Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:50.320]  You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.960]  already seen in the last three months. Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:01.540]  they force me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.

[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:37.640]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface. But rather, we have formulated
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:43.360]  our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate

[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.760]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:15.040]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:20.520]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:24.960]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:13.480]  All right, continuing our interview with David Icke from David Icke.com. This is Mike Adams
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:19.060]  filling in for Alex, who is in the UK at the Bilderberg Conference, which begins later
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:25.480]  this week. Now, in the last segment, David gave us a bewildering tour of a lot of fascinating
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:31.200]  concepts, including the actual terraforming of the planet and some unseen forces that
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.040]  are at work. And continuing with that, David, I wanted to ask you, you know, people are
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:44.260]  fed up with their food being genetically engineered, but they don't yet realize how their reality
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:48.680]  is being engineered, how their fears are being engineered. I mean, so much of what we get
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.540]  from the government and these people at the Bilderberg Conference is what I would call
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:58.240]  fear engineering. You spoke to that a little bit in the last segment. Can you give us a
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:02.920]  little more explanation of why fear is such a crucial element to their global domination
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:03.920]  plan?
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:10.960]  Well, yeah, I was just saying, Mike, about the Google agenda with the transhumanism and
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.160]  what have you. And I just want to throw in one more quick thing to connect all this with
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:27.080]  Bilderberg. Bilderberg, its job is to basically sell and bring into public policy this, well,
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:35.080]  yes, dehumanization agenda. So in the Bilderberg meetings, the interface with the Google event
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:40.760]  that's been going on, and of course Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, executive chairman, will
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.720]  be at the Bilderberg meeting, according to the list that's come out. Their job is then
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:51.840]  to push that through the politicians there and the administrators and what have you into
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:56:00.520]  public policy. And it's interesting that the head of DARPA, this sinister, deeply,
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:08.440]  deeply sinister technological development arm of the Pentagon that's really on a military
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:13.280]  level running this whole transhumanist agenda and developing the technology to push it on,
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:21.360]  was Regina Duggan. Regina Duggan left DARPA and became an executive of Google. And this
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:31.560]  very week, Mike, she was, as also she is an executive of Motorola, she was expounding
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:39.760]  the benefits of replacing passwords with an electronic tattoo, which is one step only
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.720]  from an under the skin microchip. So this is how all these things are running through.
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:55.640]  And what they use, as you point out, is fear. Fear has many, many levels and connotations
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:02.440]  for this whole story. But one of them is when you get people in fear, they will look outside
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.920]  of themselves for someone or something to protect them from what they've been manipulated
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:12.880]  into fear. This is why, all the way through history, these bloodlines have used the bogeyman,
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:18.640]  the big bagged monsters come in and all the rest of it to frighten people into giving
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:27.560]  their power away. And we must stop being frightened of all the fake bogeys and threats that they're
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:33.800]  throwing at us. And we can only really do that, again, when we start to understand the
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:39.560]  nature of our own reality. While we look in the mirror and we think of ourselves as Charlie
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:46.800]  Smith or Ethel Jones, little me, then of course, you're going to look for all these powerful
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:52.920]  people to save us good, all that rest of it. When you realize that Ethel Jones and Charlie
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:59.000]  Smith is just an experience, just a name for an experience, what we are is not our body
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:06.240]  or a name, it is that consciousness, the infinite awareness that we all are, always have been
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:12.080]  and always will be, celebrating that body. That's the true self. And if you look at it,
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:20.440]  Mike, society has been set up to get people to have their point of attention, the point
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:27.240]  at which they observe everything to the five senses, to the body level of reality. And
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:32.520]  that if they can do that and cut us off from consciousness and then control the information
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.520]  of the five senses.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.760]  Thank you, David. We've got to go to break. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but thank you.

[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:29.800]  Alex Jones. We are into the third hour continuing our interview with David Icke on the nature
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:35.980]  of reality and how reality is manipulated by global controllers to put you into a state
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:40.680]  of constant fear so that you need to beg for authority to tell you what to do, or at least
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:45.040]  that's that's part of how it works. And it reminds me, David, this is our last segment
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.600]  with you. And then Gerald Cilente takes over after this segment. But it reminds me there
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:55.960]  was a story that was just posted. This one's by Anthony Gucciardi. The LAPD was caught
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:02.600]  in an intense armed standoff with the Call of Duty video game statue at the headquarters
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:08.600]  of the company that makes the Call of Duty video games. They had a statue of a guy with
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:17.120]  a rifle. And the police, the LAPD, thought that that statue was a threat to them. Now,
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:20.840]  isn't that a great metaphor for what they have the people doing?
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  Well, what they've done, Mike, as you well know, in America, this happening everywhere
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:36.200]  is that they have spent decades systematically changing the personality of the police force
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:44.600]  and law enforcement. The old genuine copper, the old genuine police officer who used a
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:49.000]  bit of common sense and thought he was there to serve the people or she was there to serve
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.480]  the people. They've been sifted out, sifted out, sifted out. Some of them still exist.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:59.280]  It must be a nightmare to work in the system as it is now. But most of them have been sifted
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:06.640]  out. And so many of these narcissistic psychopaths have come in. And this is why YouTube is full
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:17.520]  of these unbelievable, violent scenes of police upon innocent people. But they've also used
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:22.480]  the training, this of course, this happens in the military all the time, to literally
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:30.920]  program the minds of law enforcement people who will allow their minds to fall for it.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:40.520]  And what they've turned out are people who have no sense of looking at a situation and
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:48.520]  making a judgment on the circumstances. Every time I see them, symbolically, I see a big
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:58.880]  slot in their head and a rule book pushed in or a microchip pushed in. And it's basically
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:05.400]  they find it impossible to make a decision by their own initiative. It's like they're
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:09.680]  robots. That's what they've been turned into. And then you see you get these ridiculous
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:13.880]  stories. I know I've seen some on your side from time to time. You find them all over
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:21.040]  the place. These incredible stories where people, what was this one that's been running
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.880]  the last few days? A young kid at school makes, as an experiment, he goes off with a bit of
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:34.920]  a bang and they arrest her for a destructive weapon. I mean, only the mindless and the
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.840]  brain dead could possibly react to...
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.040]  Hey, pop cards shaped like guns, bubble guns.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.000]  ...serving the system by doing so.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.120]  Right. Yeah, you name it. They've bought into the illusion at such a deep level that they
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:53.580]  can't see reality now. And we've put them in charge of policing our society. It's quite
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:54.580]  frightening.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:04:02.840]  Yeah. And if you look at society, it's always been like this, but never more than now in
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:09.680]  terms of those that run it. It's completely inverted. You take anything that society sees
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:16.200]  as normal or to be desired or to be admired and you've got to turn it absolutely on its
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:23.480]  head to see the real truth. And I've said this before, if you're born into a madhouse
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:29.840]  and basically the manipulation of the human perception and the fact that absolute, clinical,
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:36.440]  insane people have been running the world for so long, they have created a madhouse.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:44.160]  We're going through a break, David. I think David's having trouble hearing me, but David

[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.320]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:16.120]  We're back. This is the third hour of the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, June 3rd. Thank you
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:22.280]  for joining us and in this hour we continue with Gerald Cilenti taking over the broadcast and
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:26.440]  as many of you know, he is my favorite guest when he's a guest on the show. He's actually
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:32.360]  going to be a host here in a minute and before I turn it over to Gerald, I got to say that for all
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:38.520]  of you out there, Gerald Cilenti is absolutely brilliant. Not only does he get the numbers right,
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:44.600]  he nails it time and time again on all the issues that matter, especially economics and finance,
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:50.360]  but he's also entertaining. He's fun to listen to. He's a brilliant linguist. He likes to play
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.720]  with words and give us new words and phrases to use that stick in our minds and drive home key
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.480]  concepts. I love the guy. I love what he's doing. So I'm going to sign off right now. This is Mike
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.640]  Adams signing off, turning it over to Gerald Cilenti, who begins with economic news. Take
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:13.400]  it away, Gerald. Oh, thank you, Mike. And you're one of my favorites too, as is naturalnews.com.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:19.480]  There's not a lot of natural news out there, so it's really refreshing to see what you guys do.
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:26.680]  I appreciate it very much. And thank you, Alex Jones, for having me as a host on the Alex Jones
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:32.760]  show today. It's an honor and a privilege. And what I'm going to do today, Mike and everyone,
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:39.320]  is what we do every day for subscribers to the Trends Journal. And that is from Monday to Friday,
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:45.160]  we do trends in the news. So we're going to start off with today's trends in the news,
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:52.200]  talking about gold, because, you know, gold is golden. It's been around for civilizations,
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:58.600]  and it still makes a big difference of what's going on. And gold prices today have bounced up,
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:06.760]  as I speak, about $24, $25. This is a very important mark, by the way, as a trend forecaster.
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:13.560]  It's very important that gold stays above the $1,400 mark as it is right now.
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:19.160]  So it really determines where gold is going to go over the short period and long term,
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:29.560]  if gold stays above this crucial point. Now, why is gold going up today? Well, the news is that
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:39.160]  manufacturing numbers fall, unexpectedly drop, according to Bloomberg. Most U.S. stocks fell,
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:45.400]  leaving the Standard & Poor's 500 index at its lowest in nearly three weeks,
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:53.080]  after manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May, indicating industry will provide
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:11:03.320]  scant support for the economy. So what's the other side of that? More Q's. QE1, QE2, QE3,
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:09.960]  QE to infinity. So that's what we're seeing. That's why gold is going up,
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:16.840]  because there is no recovery. It's an artificial recovery. It's an interest rate recovery,
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:24.200]  as I call it. Look, in the old days, when I was a kid, people used to put money in the bank,
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:30.680]  and they used to retire on the interest that they got from it. That's right. That's ancient history
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:37.160]  in slave landia, the new name for America, the merger of state and corporate powers,
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:43.720]  and now it's the USA, China. That's what's really going on over here. So going back to interest
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:49.800]  rates, there aren't any. You put your money in the bank, the banksters make the dough,
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:57.000]  and you get nothing for return. So what does that mean? You're forced to speculate in the
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:04.280]  equity markets. That's one of the other reasons the equity markets are going up. People have no
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:12.360]  place to put their money. So it's an interest rate recovery because interest rates are at historic
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:21.880]  lows. We're celebrating the 100th year of the Federal Reserve taking over the country. That's
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:30.040]  right. The Federal Reserve Act, was it 1913, 100 years ago, gave them the power to regulate
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:36.760]  and control the supply of money. Now they've regulated to the point where they just keep
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:42.600]  pumping the money in. Stimulus, of course, is white-shoe-boy language for printing cheap
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:50.360]  money, and the other thing is low interest rates. So gold is going up because manufacturing is going
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:58.840]  down. There is no recovery. It's only temporary, an interest rate recovery, and what's boosting it
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:09.480]  is home sales and the construction industry on one end. Again, only temporary construction spending
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:17.160]  level edges higher in April. Now remember, it's only edging higher in April after record low
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:23.000]  interest rates. Total construction spending registered a small gain in April,
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:30.760]  surging home and apartment construction, volatile private non-residential activity,
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:40.040]  and shrinking public investment brings the whole report around. New apartment and home construction
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:49.400]  were the standouts. Okay, here's the deal. New apartment construction, that's because
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:58.600]  people can't afford to buy a home. Yeah, that's right, because young people back in the old days,
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:06.920]  when they got out of college, they didn't have 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 thousand, 100 thousand
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:15.240]  dollars in debt. Yeah, they could buy homes, but now of course, all the jobs that are coming out
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:28.600]  stink. Here's a story from the exchange. The real reason millennials don't buy cars and homes.
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:37.240]  Well, the percentage of 16 to 24 year olds with driver's licenses dropped sharply since 1997 and
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:46.200]  is now below 70% for the first time since 1963. You know why they can't buy cars and they're not
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:53.720]  buying them? They got no dough. The jobs stink. Here, look at the numbers here. I'm not making
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:15:05.000]  this up. Wealth from economic recovery has gone to the richest Americans. Top 1% got 93% of income
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:13.080]  growth as rich poor gap widened. Oh, this story came out on Saturday when no one was paying
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:20.280]  attention. Saturday is the least followed news day of the week, and this isn't from a communist
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:30.600]  paper. It's from Bloomberg. Yeah. Since it goes on, the numbers are right here. The 1.2 million
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:39.320]  households whose income put them at the top 1% of the US saw their earnings increase 5.5%
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:48.440]  last year, according to the US Census Bureau. So this isn't like a lefty organization making
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:58.840]  these numbers up. Well, earnings fell 1.7% for the 96 million households in the bottom 80%.
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:16.440]  Those that made less than $101,583. In 2010, the top 1% of families captured as much as
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:24.920]  93% of the nation's income. The earnings gap between rich and poor Americans was the widest
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:32.520]  in more than four decades in 2011. Now, check this out. You don't like when you're walking down
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:37.560]  the street and you're going to some of these supermarkets, and man, my own, it really looks
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:43.960]  bad out there. When you look at some of the people, your eyes are telling the truth. Yeah,
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:54.040]  now remember, this is from the Census Bureau. Census data shows surpassing income inequality
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:17:01.880]  previously reported in the United States is surpassing income inequality previously reported
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:13.400]  in Uganda and Kazakhstan. All right. I mean, I've never been to Uganda, Kazakhstan,
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.760]  but I know they're not at the top of the pyramid when it comes to quality in life.
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:29.480]  And neither is the United States. Even the meandering economy generated 4.6 million
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:40.360]  private sector jobs since February 2010. Almost 40% of them were in the fields of hospitality.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:46.920]  Don't you love the word hospitality? That means making somebody's bed in a hotel.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:54.200]  It means room service. It means waiting on tables. It means jobs that pay crap
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:01.640]  while the fat cats keep getting fatter and everybody else keeps getting poorer.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:12.120]  Temporary staffing, where the average wage is below $15 an hour. About 11.7% of middle-income
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:23.160]  families own stock in 2010, down from 14% in 2007. So when they're talking about a rising
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:30.920]  stock market, the money's only going to the top. Although US consumer spending climbs up
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:37.000]  to its highest level in four years in August, according to the Gallup survey, it still lags
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:47.320]  2008 levels by more than 20%. And what are people buying? Hey, have a lovely time at Family Dollar,
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:57.960]  because that's all you have to spend. It just keeps getting worse. From 1979 to 2007,
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:05.000]  about $1.1 trillion in annual income shifted to the top 1% of Americans.
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:13.160]  So there you got it. Those are the numbers. The numbers don't lie, but the people that are saying
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:21.320]  that there's a recovery, they're lying. As a matter of fact, making fun of the gold news
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:29.000]  is none other than Nouri al-Rabini, who they call Dr. Doom. He says that gold prices really
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:36.280]  don't make a difference, because after all, gold isn't a medium of exchange. You could store it,
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:41.960]  but it's really not a unit of wealth that you can exchange for product and services.
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:48.760]  He says you can't buy groceries with it. Tell that to the Iranians and tell it to the Chinese,
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:20:01.000]  tell it to the Chinese, because you know why? They're exchanging oil for gold. Get it, Nouri al?
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.480]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements? I have, and all of them don't taste that good,
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:09.320]  have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars. About a year ago,
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:13.800]  I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience. This protein powder made
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:18.840]  me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had. Here's
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:23.480]  the experience of one satisfied user named Rich. The term best of all worlds has been
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:28.680]  belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:35.480]  called best of all worlds. Best taste, by far. Best results, by far. You almost feel like you're
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:40.280]  cheating that something that tastes that good could be so good for you. Thank you, Stephen,
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:46.600]  and Cocoon Nutrition. One World Whey truly is the best of all worlds. The only way for me.
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:55.720]  Yours truly, Rich from Georgia. Real user, real happy. Call 888-988-3325 or visit

[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.480]  power equipment or vehicle be ready? Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored,
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:12.280]  and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.

[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:34.680]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:38.840]  counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:43.080]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:46.600]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:50.680]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:57.640]  Call for your copy. 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:04.200]  That's 800-686-2237. Friends, this is Alex Jones from MidasResources.com.
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:09.720]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used MidasResources for all my precious metal needs.
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:15.320]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, MidasResources is simply the best.
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:20.760]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation. This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:25.400]  the way of the Deutschmark and the Weimar Republic any time. In these historically
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:30.440]  dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver. Midas already has some
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:34.680]  of the best deals in the industry. But if you give them a call and mention the radio special,
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:37.640]  they will give you a list of the day's super specials.
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:44.840]  Midas brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237. They also have a lot
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:50.280]  of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding precious metals.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:58.680]  They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237. Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:04.440]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.880]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:14.440]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:20.200]  could obtain its world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:25.160]  world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:31.320]  superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:36.120]  without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally
[02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:40.600]  wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:56.200]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com. That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:24:11.640]  Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:19.720]  So as I was saying, gold, gold. I'm in gold for the long term. I want to make this perfectly clear.
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:27.720]  I don't call tops or bottoms. This is an interest rate recovery all over the world. The Japanese
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:34.120]  with their stimulus, the Europeans with their stimulus, all over the world, they're pumping
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:42.200]  in cheap dough. And as I said, here's the quote from Nouriel Roubini, gold is not a means of
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:50.360]  payment. You cannot pay for your groceries with it, nor is it a unit to account.
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:25:03.320]  You can't buy, prices of goods and services are not denominated in gold terms. Again, tell that
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:08.760]  to the Iranians and the Chinese. I think the Persians and the Chinese, by the way, have
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:17.960]  been around a lot longer than Nouriel Roubini. Gold is real. And when times get tough, gold for
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:25.880]  me is what you have in your hand. Gerald Cilenti's, GC's, 3G's, guns, gold, and a getaway plan
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:36.440]  when it hits the fan. Hey, from Al Jazeera, Iraq sees deadliest month since 2008.
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:43.560]  UN Chief's representative urges an end to the bloodshed as toll of civilians and security
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:52.200]  personnel cross 1,000. Hey, remember all of those people that said, hey, Iraq is a better place
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:58.840]  without Saddam Hussein, and it was worth the war. You know, the trillion dollars spent and the
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:05.320]  million people killed, plus our soldiers that have lost their lives, limbs, and their minds.
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:09.880]  Here, check out this video. Look what these psychopaths said.
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:15.160]  I think the removal of Saddam Hussein was the right decision. We are safer, more secure,
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:20.280]  that Iraq is better, but our own security is better. With Saddam and his two sons out of power
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:26.680]  and out of office than in office, I believe indeed that we are. But Saddam Hussein was a unique
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:31.240]  threat, and the world is better off without him in power. What we did in Iraq was the right thing
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.400]  to do. It was hard to do. It took a long time. There were significant costs involved.
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:39.320]  It was the right thing to do, and the world is a safer place for having that death.
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:44.680]  Yes or no, did the Iraq war make America seem? Yes, absolutely. Can you imagine what the world
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:50.520]  would be like with Saddam Hussein in control of the third largest oil reserves in the world,
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:56.120]  in the heart of the Middle East? These guys are psychopaths.
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:01.560]  Look at them. Did you get the porky pig of politics over there, Karl Rove, with his last
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:10.120]  statement? What was Saddam Hussein in charge of the third largest oil reserves in the Middle East?
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:16.200]  It's none of our business. You don't attack foreign countries because you want their
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:23.160]  goods and services. Or maybe imperialists do, and immoral people like you, porky pig.
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:29.240]  This is disgusting. You want to know how America could come back? People ask me all the time.
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:37.080]  It's very simple. Do what the founding fathers suggested. Stay out of foreign entanglements.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:42.680]  No, Iraq is not better off without Saddam Hussein, and neither is the rest of the world,
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:49.880]  because from Iraq also came Al-Qaeda, more of Al-Qaeda. And where is Al-Qaeda now?
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:55.000]  Oh, they're over there in Libya. You remember Libya? That was the place that Chickenhawk,
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:03.960]  Cameron, Sarkozy, and Obama were gonna free up to get rid of that dictator's Gaddafi.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:10.120]  And now look what happened. Al-Qaeda's in charge over there. Now they're destabilizing Syria.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:17.080]  This is madness, and the mad men are in control. Oh, a great little story.
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:26.280]  Got coming out in the Financial Times today. China is doing a big deal with Iraq,
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:37.560]  another big deal for China. While the United States wages war, China wages business.
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:48.520]  China wages business, and they're waging business right here in the good old USA.
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:57.880]  Yeah, you remember that news last week? China's buying up Smithfield. Yeah, the biggest pork
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:04.360]  producer in the United States, or one of them. Yeah. And what else is China buying up? Oh,
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:10.840]  you're buying up Club Med. They're buying up the world. Oh, the Prime Minister, Xi,
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:17.400]  he is down in the Caribbean now making deals all over the region.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:25.320]  While America, what are they doing? We got John Kerry, the ketchup king, you know,
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:31.320]  Heinz's little boy, going all over the world talking about more war with Syria.
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:37.080]  And how we have to support the rebels. And how we're sending more troops into the area.
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:44.520]  And now talking about expansion into Asia. And when I come back, we're going to talk
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:52.440]  more about pigs, porks and rats. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.440 --> 02:30:02.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:07.640]  eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally
[02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:12.840]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that,
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:18.600]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:23.320]  hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:31.720]  helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:37.000]  Holland Burst and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.760]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my

[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:09.320]  don't even realize the serious concern for all of us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:15.000]  most important supply you can for your liberty, freedom and security and that's food. We thought
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:21.160]  the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need
[02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:26.040]  financial assistance to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the
[02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:31.320]  most effective way you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation.
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:36.920]  The do-it-yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer
[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:41.720]  be provided. This, along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations
[02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:48.040]  and additional government control of food supplies and resources, says food is the ultimate priority.
[02:32:48.040 --> 02:32:52.600]  e Foods Direct will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice.
[02:32:52.600 --> 02:33:05.240]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. We now take you live to the Central
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:11.480]  Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:19.800]  Hey, this is Gerald Cilenti and I'm back and I'm happy to be your host on the Alex Jones show as
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:28.840]  he's over there exposing the Bilderberg bullies who are taking control of the entire globe.
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:37.160]  It's a takeover. The multinationals are in control. And now it's coming back right here
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:43.880]  to the United States. Even the Chinese are grabbing a piece of the action. As I mentioned,
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:50.120]  they're buying Smithfield up, one of those big pork producers and a lot of labels out there
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:57.800]  that you're all familiar with. Here's a story in today's New York Times. The self-proclaimed
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:04.600]  paper of record, which I like to call the toilet paper of record. Chinese bid for US pork
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:13.160]  had links to Wall Street. You see what I mean? That is a BS line. How nice they say it.
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:21.640]  How about a criminal operation where the mafia is all working together to pull off another big deal
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:27.960]  that's going to screw the people short term, long term? That would have been more appropriate,
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:38.040]  but I digress. Let me move on. When a Chinese company bid 4.7 billion last week to take over
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:47.240]  Smithfield's, America's biggest pork producer, the deal was announced by the company's Chinese
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:54.360]  executives. But behind the bid was a group of savvy investors. Savvy investors, you know what
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:35:02.600]  that means? Savvy investors is a BS line for the guys in that are doing the deal in a rigged game
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:09.880]  that know how it's going to fall out and put all their bets down as the suckers stand around the
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:15.640]  table thinking they're going to win the game. It's an inside deal, but we'll call them savvy
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:24.920]  investors because that's nice and proper. And global deal makers, again, a BS word,
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:31.080]  who hold a substantial stake in the Chinese company. Oh, and you know who those
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:41.880]  global deal makers are and savvy investors? Goldman Sachs, the Goldman Sachs gang, yeah.
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:53.400]  CDH Investments, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund and New Horizon Capital, a private equity
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:36:03.640]  firm founded by the son of the former Chinese prime minister, Wenzhou Bo. You get it? The group
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:10.360]  controls nearly half the shares of Shungai International, much of which was acquired
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:16.920]  about seven years ago by helping privatize the company that had been run by a state-owned
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:24.760]  meat processor. It's all inside deals. Privatization, by the way, that too is
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:32.840]  white shoe boy language for selling expensive public assets to your buddies on inside deals
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:41.800]  for pennies on the dollar. So here you got it, the Chinese buy in Smithfield.
[02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:49.800]  This company, by the way, is a huge pork producer. Now, check this out. These are the Chinese,
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:56.680]  rat meat and Chinese food safety. This was only May 12th. It is in ancient history.
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:02.920]  The latest food scandal in China, which has seen rat meat passed off as lamb,
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:10.520]  has raised more questions about food safety in the country. Okay? And then there's that
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:18.600]  bird flu thing going on. And now, people also forgot, this is from March 20th,
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:29.320]  the number of dead pigs pulled out of the Hangpu River in Shanghai crossed 10,000
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:38.440]  since the city government started fishing out the pig carcasses about two weeks ago.
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:46.120]  Now, let me get this straight. They got pigs floating down the Hangpu and now they're taking
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:54.440]  over the biggest pig producer in the United States. What are we gonna have now? Pigs floating
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:38:06.520]  down the Potomac? I mean, that's all it is. Pigs to pigs. I think they should change the
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:17.720]  symbols of the Democratic and Republican parties. The elephants are the pigs and the Democrats are
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:26.440]  the rats. That's right. The Democrats are the rats that began to sell America out full time
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:34.600]  with Bill Clinton's NAFTA. And of course, the elephant pigs, they started paving the
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:41.240]  deal with Nixon playing ping pong over there in China to get the deals rolling.
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:49.720]  So now you could see what's happening. As I said, as the United States wages war,
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:39:02.520]  China wages business and now they're taking over America. There's another side to the Chinese
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:10.840]  pig story and those gluttons that sold out Smithfield. You see the Chinese food,
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:14.600]  I love it by the way, you go into a health food store, this is one of my favorite.
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:21.160]  I don't eat corporate food. And I'm Italian, I like to cook and I have a wonderful recipe
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:29.960]  that I make with broccoli and pignoli nuts and olives, orchiette, nice fine olive oil.
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:37.560]  And a couple of other ingredients like capers. So I like pignoli nuts. I go into the health food
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:45.160]  store. The pignoli nuts come from China. Yeah, guaranteed to be organic. And I got a bridge
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:50.600]  for you to buy over there in Brooklyn. And I'll give it to you at a good price.
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:59.080]  The Chinese, once they have established their companies in the United States, now could be
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:07.640]  bringing in more of their crappy products and sell it to us and pass it off whatever they want.
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:20.040]  Oh, and by the way, only about 2% or less of imported product is looked at and tested by the
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:28.440]  FDA and the agricultural department. So virtually nothing is being looked at. And by the way,
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:33.480]  as a trend forecast, the way you look at when you look at this trend is to see what the
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:42.680]  opportunities in food, natural as in natural news, natural food, natural healing. That is
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:49.800]  the future. Entrepreneurs understanding that not everybody watches the Kardashians.
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:58.280]  Not everybody tunes in the cartoon news, wet network, CNN, the most trusted name in news.
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:05.160]  So there are a lot of people that are very concerned about their health. And health is
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:12.440]  going to continue to be one of the biggest motivators for profit opportunities among
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:22.200]  those who look for whole health healing as myself to be the major trend as we continue to move into
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:33.320]  the 21st century and continue to see a population that's aging and a very sizable segment of it,
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:40.680]  looking to age healthy. Because in the words of Mr. Boogie, you got a boogie before the lights go
[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:47.400]  out because tomorrow is iffy. So you need to stay in good health to boogie now because you don't
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:54.600]  know what's going to happen tomorrow. Health, nutrition, fitness. And by the way, there is a
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:42:01.560]  Renaissance already taking place. And the Renaissance is in food. Break the chains. You
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:08.600]  hear me say it all the time. Now check it out. Use your head. If the Chinese are going to be taking
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:15.960]  over the nation's largest pork producer and they're being taken over by a company that is
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:22.440]  already one of the largest pork producers in the world, guess what you're going to get at those
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:32.520]  chain food places and all that fast food crap that you eat? You're going to get Chinese pork.
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:40.840]  Chinese pork. It's already disgusting food the way agribusiness has destroyed it. And what they've
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:47.480]  done to these poor animals, these inhumane conditions, now you can guarantee it's even
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:59.640]  going to get worse. So remember, the future is in food. You know, talking about China, by the way,
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:07.000]  a little note that comes out, kind of things you look at as a trend forecaster. And this again,
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.960]  this is over the weekend. The news doesn't come out very big. It's buried in the second section
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:20.840]  of the Financial Times way down on the bottom. Iron ore root amid mounting concern over China
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:28.120]  demand. Iron ore prices suffered their sharpest fall in more than a year this week as steel
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:35.080]  traders and mills rushed to dump their stocks amid fears over the outlook for China demand.
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:41.240]  So things are slowing down globally. Again, the only way they're going to pump the markets up
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:48.760]  is by pumping money into them. And the more money they pump in, the higher gold prices
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:56.120]  should go. And again, we're not only looking at problems in the United States.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:03.480]  Hey, over the weekend, as they were talking about stupid crap on CNN and continue to do so,
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:14.680]  or on MSNBC, mindless news for nobody, and CBS and ABC, et cetera, a little story came out.
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:23.640]  Anti-austerity protests held across Europe. Gee, I wonder why. Demonstrations
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:31.240]  take place in Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Germany, as anger against continent-wide
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:39.640]  austerity pressures grows. These are not austerity pressures. These are robbing the people
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:46.040]  to give the money to the people that have all the money already. That's what austerity measures are.
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:53.640]  That's what austerity measures are. Austerity measures means raising taxes, cutting services,
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:45:00.200]  killing your pensions and benefits, and increasing the age of retirement until after you die.
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:07.960]  And I'm sick of hearing that term entitlements. Social security is not an entitlement.
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:15.160]  Medical benefits are not an entitlement. Just to get this straight for anybody that's too stupid
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:25.320]  to read or too deaf to hear, we put tons of our money that they steal from us from every damn
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:35.000]  paycheck in social security and federal taxes. And then when it's time for us to get it back,
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:43.480]  they say, screw you. They're entitlements. And we'll give them back to you if we feel like it.
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:51.000]  But meanwhile, we're going to give you less back than we promised. And you know why? Because
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:57.800]  the pigs and the rats are in control, the Democrats and the Republicans. I'm a political
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:05.480]  atheist, as you know. I don't believe in any of these religious political parties. Politics has
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:10.760]  become a religion, and I don't bow to political gods. Oh, you know that guy Dingle you got over
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:15.960]  there? That's been screwing you people over there in Michigan all these years.
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:26.120]  The cat's going on to his 57th year, 57th year as a public servant, a public servant. Hey, Dingle,
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:34.760]  I got some toilets to get clean, public servant. These guys are just sucking off the public tit
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:41.480]  their entire life. They never work a day in their lives. And there are loads of them,
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:50.040]  loads of them. Just look through Congress. I want to see term limits. Enough of this baloney.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.680]  The same thing goes on around the world. It's no different over here.
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:02.760]  As I speak, they're demonstrating over there in Turkey. Yeah, you know that place that
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:09.960]  wanted to get into the European Union all the time, but they never let them. But always when
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:16.360]  they need soldiers to kill and NATO troops. Boy, the Turks are on the front line doing that work.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:25.480]  They were in South Korea, rather. They were in Vietnam. They were in Iraq. Oh, yeah. Always
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:30.600]  waging war, but they're not quite in the money game yet. Well, they're having their problems
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:39.480]  there too. Here's the headline from the Financial Times. Turkey's protests reignite. Yep.
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:48.040]  This series of television appearances following the occupation of Taksim Square,
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:57.000]  Risab, Erdogan, that's the prime minister, dismissed protesters across the country's
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:06.840]  biggest cities as looters. He destroyed Twitter as a curse and branded anyone who drank alcohol
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:15.800]  an alcoholic. Yeah, you look at this photo of these protesters. They certainly don't look like
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:22.920]  looters, alcoholics who have been cursed by Twitters. You couldn't have more middle class
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:31.480]  looking cats in your life. But to make this point, Erdogan says many protesters say that
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:39.720]  his authoritarian tendencies on the part of his regime are the root cause of the scale
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:45.880]  of discontent, citing measures such as a new law to restrict the consumption of alcohol.
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:53.880]  Quote, I do these things because I love all my citizens. I want them to get rid of their bad
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:49:03.080]  habits. I know you get it. I do these things because I love all my citizens. Hey, Junior,
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:12.280]  see if you can handle this one. How about doing what your citizens tell you to do? Could you
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:23.480]  handle that? No, none of them can handle it. Look what goes on. Every time these cats come out,
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:29.320]  man, they roll out the red carpets, whether it's the presidents, the prime ministers,
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:39.560]  the chancellors, you name the country. They got enough flunkies standing around saluting
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:46.840]  and blowing trumpets. You wanna cut back the budget and save money, put these people to work.
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:53.080]  Why do they gotta roll out a red carpet? Listen, the next time I come on the Alex Jones show,
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:50:00.520]  I want trumpets. You guys stand up and salute. Who made this crap up?
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:05.960]  And that's what's going on and it goes back to Bilderberg. They're all better than we are.
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:15.320]  They tell us what to do. The New World Order has taken over and you don't have to look behind the
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:23.160]  curtains to see it. It's the banking order. It's the money junkies and it's the military
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:31.880]  industrial complex. Hey, our new Secretary of Defense, he's over there now talking about America
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:41.560]  expanding into Asia with its quote, pivot Asia operation. How about pivoting back home?
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:53.640]  Check the number out. Over 6 trillion, that's where the T has been spent on the Afghan and
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:51:02.040]  Iraq war. Bring the money home. 6 trillion for USA.
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:28.200]  And support the relief effort. We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with

[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:24.280]  Thank you, thank you for having me back, Alex Jones. All the best of good fortune over there
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:32.360]  in Bilderberg, exposing the global takeover by the New World Order, the banking order,
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:38.120]  the money junkie order, and the military industrial complex. And as I was saying,
[02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:46.680]  as we went into break, imagine $6 trillion spent on the Afghan and Iraq wars for nothing,
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:54.760]  to only destroy two countries and destroy the lives of millions of people, including our troops,
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:55:01.640]  who have lost their lives, their limbs, many of their minds, committing suicide and getting very
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:07.960]  little when they come back. I want our money to be met back in America. I believe in what
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:14.840]  the founding fathers stood for, no foreign entanglements. And there's going to be more
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:22.440]  foreign entanglements. As I was mentioning, our Secretary of State Chuck Hagel is over there
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:31.160]  pushing for pivot Asia. Singapore, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, toward the US Navy's small
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:38.920]  combat ship, the USS Freedom. Boy, what did they ask Orwell to leave notes to name these
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:46.360]  things after he passed away, like Patriot missiles? I love that one too. The first of
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:53.880]  a new class of littoral warships recently deployed to Asia to partner with allies in the region.
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:56:00.520]  Oh yeah, allies like Japan, you remember them, yeah. Tora, Tora, Tora, yeah, that Japan,
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:08.840]  the Pearl Harbor Japan, allies. Anyway, his visit to the ship on Sunday comes amid nagging questions
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:20.280]  about the cost and viability of the roughly $34 billion program and the Pentagon buying 42 pieces
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:27.800]  of this crap. You know how much junk that they keep making and throwing away? When I wrote
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:36.200]  Trend Tracking back in 1988, the government had already spent $13 trillion on the Cold War.
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:41.800]  General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us that the military industrial complex is robbing us of the
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:47.880]  genius of our scientists, the sweat of our laborers, and the future of our children.
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:53.480]  It's right here in black and white. It's being robbed. And what they're also talking about,
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:57:00.920]  UK to ship arms if Syria talks fail. This is from the Financial Times. Britain and France this week
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:07.880]  forced through an amendment to a UN arms embargo that opened the door for supply of weapons to the
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:17.080]  opposition forces. In recent weeks, the US has secretly undertaken significant lobbying of EU
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:27.000]  member states in order to get the EU arms embargo amended, the officials said. Hey, you know where
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:34.360]  this comes from? No, no, not the World Socialist newspaper, not the Progressive, not Counterpunch,
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:45.960]  the Financial Times. It's as obvious as that. The US is setting us up for a new war in Syria.
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:52.440]  And now they're talking about a no-fly zone. Yeah, you know what that is. You remember that one in
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:58:00.440]  Libya. A no-fly zone means they bomb the hell out of the government that's in control. And you
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:08.520]  listen to what every one of the prostitutes repeat from the government officials, Assad has to go.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:13.320]  I say if they want him to go, any of those officials that want him to go, go take him out
[02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:20.280]  and leave us out of your psycho trip. We'll lead a death match. Obama wants Assad out. Let's put
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:25.400]  him in the arena and let them fight it out and keep us out of it like the real warriors used to
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:33.080]  do. I want to thank Alex Jones again. And remember, please look us up at trendsjournal.com,
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:38.920]  the trends journal, the only place you'll get history before it happens. And that was some of
[02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:51.400]  today's trends in the news.
