[00:00.000 --> 00:07.720]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.720 --> 00:15.760]  GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.120 --> 00:28.400]  Welcome my friends, welcome to this very important Friday edition, the 15th day of
[00:28.400 --> 00:35.920]  August 2008. We'll be live here for the next three hours and 59 minutes, 18
[00:35.920 --> 00:40.240]  seconds. We are going to have wide open phones throughout the day. Professor
[00:40.240 --> 00:46.600]  Michelle Czosodowski, expert on what's happening with Poland, Georgia, Ukraine,
[00:46.600 --> 00:51.440]  Russia. We'll be joining us for 30 minutes coming up at the middle of this
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.160]  hour. Then Jonathan Elanoff, they're reporting that they're going to be putting
[00:56.160 --> 01:01.960]  people on a little makeshift FEMA camp as they did at the RNC in 2004 that we
[01:01.960 --> 01:08.080]  covered. He was able to successfully sneak in to the facility and get a video
[01:08.080 --> 01:12.760]  of that. Jonathan Elanoff, we are Change Colorado now with something like 500
[01:12.760 --> 01:18.080]  members really exploding that one chapter. And then of course popping in with
[01:18.080 --> 01:20.920]  this multiple times weekly to track all the economic and geopolitical
[01:20.920 --> 01:25.760]  developments as well as Russia. Bob Chapman with us in the fourth hour today.
[01:25.760 --> 01:31.640]  So Michael Czosodowski, Jonathan Elanoff and Bob Chapman all on the show, on the
[01:31.640 --> 01:36.680]  transmission for you today. Huge developments with the Russian escalation
[01:36.680 --> 01:42.320]  kicking off the old Cold War, but in a hotter, more dangerous, more accelerated
[01:42.320 --> 01:44.480]  way.
[01:47.720 --> 01:54.280]  Russia-Poland risk attacks because of U.S. missiles. Now that is the associated
[01:54.280 --> 02:01.520]  press headline. A top Russian general said Friday that Poland's agreement to
[02:01.520 --> 02:07.720]  accept a U.S. missile interceptor base exposes the ex-communist nation to attack
[02:07.720 --> 02:13.000]  possibly by nuclear weapons. The Interfax News Agency reported. Also top
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.400]  geopolitical author U.S. risking nuclear war with Russia. Neocons up nuclear war
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.720]  anti with Poland missile shield. Excellent analysis from Curtinemo at
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.520]  infowars.com. So Paul Watson's done a story. Top geopolitical author U.S. risk
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.240]  nuclear war with Russia. That's at prisonplanet.com and covering the same
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.240]  story but from different perspective and angle. Neocons up nuclear war anti with
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.280]  Poland missile shield infowars.com Curtinemo. Russia seizes arsenal of U.S.
[02:45.280 --> 02:53.440]  weapons in Georgia. Dow Jones news is reporting. Russia keeps up its blockade
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.280]  of strategic Georgian city. Obama fanatics slam author for questioning 911
[03:01.280 --> 03:05.640]  truth. Well the New York Times also slammed myself. Yours truly this radio
[03:05.640 --> 03:13.680]  talk show host and investigative journalist documentary filmmaker. So a
[03:13.680 --> 03:23.200]  huge attack there. We'll be going over that. Dr. Corsi when I saw this last
[03:23.200 --> 03:28.680]  night. Saw the story in the New York Times. Another one today bashing him for
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.640]  going on the vicious evil Alex Jones show. I mean I am blacklisted folks. I
[03:33.640 --> 03:42.480]  mean they they they have Fox News CNN MSNBC. New York Times just scores of
[03:42.480 --> 03:49.640]  publications on our almost daily basis now. Ron Paul goes on Alex Jones. Dr.
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.960]  Corsi goes on Alex Jones. I mean he talked about being blackballed. The
[03:54.960 --> 04:02.000]  blacklist. Man I am proud to be numero uno. The black sheep. The wicked devil
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.200]  according to the corporate whore media. And Corsi's publicist calls us today and
[04:08.200 --> 04:11.920]  said he's not coming on now. We had a scheduling problem. He'll just have to
[04:11.920 --> 04:17.160]  be on next week. Well I said Trey that's a complete bull. That's political. I said
[04:17.160 --> 04:22.000]  you call. Of course he's always asking to come on. I can use another word but we
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.400]  like having him begging to come on. Because he knows it's a big show. But
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.880]  he'll tell you a bigger response here than any other show he goes on. That
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.200]  means TV, Fox, when back any of it. Because we've got active lists. Not just
[04:33.200 --> 04:37.760]  millions but active listeners. But we talked to Corsi this morning. We're
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.480]  going to tell you that the behind the scenes intrigue going on here. But look
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.200]  first I got to cover Russia and what's happening there. Okay because this
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.280]  affects everybody. Frankly I'm going to talk about myself in the New York Times

[04:58.480 --> 05:03.920]  future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the
[05:03.920 --> 05:09.760]  builder bird. But their objective being world domination. For thousands of years
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.760]  their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their
[05:14.760 --> 05:22.840]  great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time

[08:31.680 --> 08:34.640]  Okay we're going to break down what's happening with Russia
[08:34.640 --> 08:37.360]  right now. Then we're going to look more depth into
[08:37.360 --> 08:41.680]  that with into more depth into that subject with Professor Michelle
[08:41.680 --> 08:45.280]  Chassadossi coming up in about 25 minutes. Russia, Poland risk
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.360]  attacks because of U.S. missile shield.
[08:50.080 --> 08:55.120]  Now my detractors whenever I read one of these AP articles
[08:55.120 --> 08:58.400]  they go out and create YouTube videos and things saying that
[08:58.400 --> 09:01.440]  I don't want to talk about myself here but we have to. This show
[09:01.440 --> 09:06.800]  is coming under so much attack. Now from the mainstream media, the New York Times,
[09:06.800 --> 09:12.720]  Fox News, CNN, we're coming under such incredible attack from
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.000]  operatives on the internet and their fellow travelers and well-meaning
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.440]  idiots that are sucked into it that I just have to
[09:19.440 --> 09:23.840]  I guess caveat mention here that I'm reading the Associated Press.
[09:23.840 --> 09:27.280]  What they do is they edit this together with me saying other incendiary things
[09:27.280 --> 09:30.320]  out of the news and then make it sound like I'm saying that
[09:30.320 --> 09:33.360]  Russia's a nuptious or launched missiles at us.
[09:33.360 --> 09:40.160]  Here's the famous case of ABC News and it was
[09:40.160 --> 09:47.200]  December 31st 1999 and I'm a Michael Trudeau's radio show back when he had
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.280]  a show on this station. One of the hosts here
[09:51.280 --> 09:54.480]  that was co-hosting throughout the day with continual coverage now and she
[09:54.480 --> 09:59.040]  runs it and says ABC News is saying a missile's been fired from Russia
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.840]  and I ran out and there was ABC News and Peter Jennings saying yes.
[10:03.840 --> 10:06.960]  NORAD is saying a missile has been fired from Russia
[10:06.960 --> 10:10.800]  out of Chechnya. We don't know if it's intercontinental ballistic or theater
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.240]  missile, intermediate range but NORAD is on the highest alert
[10:16.240 --> 10:21.040]  and I come back on there and say okay this is what ABC News said.
[10:21.040 --> 10:26.960]  Then people knowing, the government knowing,
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.360]  their operatives knowing and plus people that are just flat out jealous of me
[10:31.360 --> 10:34.400]  for some reason, knowing the public has no memory,
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.920]  knowing they have no grasp of that months later said look Alex Jones
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.960]  claimed nukes were launched from Russia against the U.S.
[10:44.960 --> 10:47.680]  Now 30 minutes after they announced that some missiles
[10:47.680 --> 10:50.480]  been fired we don't know if it's a nuke, we don't know if it's conventional,
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.240]  we don't know what range missile it is, they came out with a weird press
[10:54.240 --> 11:00.480]  conference with Russians at NORAD and the Pentagon,
[11:00.480 --> 11:05.840]  the SAC based commanders was there in Colorado Springs,
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.320]  came out and said okay it was a scud missile launch in the Chechnyan war
[11:10.320 --> 11:14.800]  that got high enough up to look like an ICBM no problem
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.200]  and it turns out that was probably some type of weird drill or test of NORAD
[11:19.200 --> 11:21.680]  while the Russians were there in fact that leaked out in the media that that's
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.040]  probably what it was to show the Russians see we can even see one of your
[11:25.040 --> 11:28.560]  scudge being launched and they were all laughing and joking and smiling during
[11:28.560 --> 11:31.920]  the press conference like it was some type of joke on the public
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.480]  something went on there doesn't matter people misrepresented and I hate to
[11:36.480 --> 11:39.200]  even give my ideas they're gonna do it anyways they've already done this
[11:39.200 --> 11:45.040]  last week there are people saying I made up that there's even a war over there
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.200]  in Georgia I mean and you laugh at that but remember the general
[11:49.200 --> 11:52.400]  public doesn't know where Russia is they don't know anything
[11:52.400 --> 11:55.280]  and and and so the government and their operatives
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.520]  they target people who don't know anybody
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.840]  they target people who have no grasp of reality
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.120]  now I shouldn't have prefaced this it it doesn't matter I just
[12:07.120 --> 12:10.800]  realize when I cover the associated press that it could be edited together
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.320]  later and it probably will it shocks me on youtube I mean they'll
[12:14.320 --> 12:17.680]  edit me together saying I hate America
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.520]  death to America when I was quoting neocons
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.760]  and then they'll go say I said that and then people buy it I mean they revel
[12:25.760 --> 12:33.520]  in deception they revel it but those that practice this deception
[12:33.520 --> 12:37.520]  that's the reason the newspapers are down by over 60 circulation why tv's
[12:37.520 --> 12:40.400]  imploding by mainstream news admits that they're losing all
[12:40.400 --> 12:44.160]  credibility and most their viewers because the public may be dumbed down a
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.400]  large segment of the majority but even the dumbed down public doesn't trust you
[12:48.400 --> 12:52.880]  anymore so you're spoiling your own dirty
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.640]  little nest and it's just incredible
[12:58.640 --> 13:01.840]  people then also say well you you say the mainstream media lies you say the
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.800]  mainstream media distorts you say they spin they have scorned with the truth
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.560]  why do you then quote them so much well
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.320]  there's different types of propaganda different types of media
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.640]  and we look at media from different angles and so we can look at russian
[13:18.640 --> 13:23.120]  german dutch japanese iraqi
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.960]  french we can watch the raw video feeds and then we get a clear picture of what
[13:26.960 --> 13:29.440]  indeed happened it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of
[13:29.440 --> 13:32.800]  research it takes a lot of hard work
[13:32.800 --> 13:41.520]  but we told you day one that georgia attacked ocedium
[13:41.520 --> 13:44.640]  now that the details are out it turns out for weeks
[13:44.640 --> 13:48.240]  the georgian military was just randomly shelling
[13:48.240 --> 13:50.880]  civilians
[13:52.640 --> 13:55.840]  you know said he had to turn the water off so they it was already siege over
[13:55.840 --> 14:01.840]  there and then georgian peacekeepers with the un
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.640]  force made up of russians europeans west europeans and
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.720]  and a contingent from around the world and georgians the georgians opened fire
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.400]  inside the bases they ran a sneak attack i mean
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.560]  it's now admitted they came up behind their fellow peacekeepers in the same
[14:18.560 --> 14:23.120]  uniforms and stabbed them in the backs not figuratively
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.640]  literally grabbed the mouth in the kidney rotated
[14:26.640 --> 14:32.000]  slit the throat choking them with tourniquets
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.040]  that's now confirmed when russian peacekeepers would run out of their
[14:37.040 --> 14:40.480]  barracks once they were under bombardment the georgians were set up
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.840]  inside their own base but the georgian peacekeepers had already gotten
[14:43.840 --> 14:46.560]  together beforehand this is the prim meditativeness of it
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.280]  and mowed them down as they were running out of their buildings
[14:51.280 --> 14:58.320]  i mean a total covert sneak attack a coup d'etat
[14:58.320 --> 15:05.760]  against osetia in violation of the 1992 accords
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.040]  and then u.s special forces trainers israelis ukrainians backing up georgians
[15:11.040 --> 15:13.680]  went house to house and scores of towns and cities
[15:13.680 --> 15:22.400]  murdering people in mass and now the numbers are coming out it's well above 2000
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.800]  little towns villages standalone farmhouses they go in the videos all
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.360]  over the far and european russian news never on the u.s news
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.040]  and it just shows dead bodies we have a fox news clip where he's got these
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.240]  americans on who happen to be over there visiting and he says so the russians
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.640]  were attacking and killing you and they go no no the georgians attacked us thank
[15:42.640 --> 15:45.120]  you russia for saving us they were coming door to door
[15:45.120 --> 15:48.000]  killing us we barely got out if the russians wouldn't have come in they
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.320]  would have killed us and they go we got to go to commercial
[15:54.320 --> 15:58.400]  and they come back and say that's what russia wants you to think
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.600]  shepherd smith or whatever his name is hammerhead's name is
[16:03.600 --> 16:09.920]  guys got the eyes on the side of his head
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.000]  poland risk attack because of u.s missiles
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.520]  a top russian general said friday that poland's agreement to accept a u.s
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.040]  missile interceptor base expose the x-communistation to attack
[16:21.040 --> 16:23.920]  possible nuclear weapons interface news agency reported
[16:23.920 --> 16:27.520]  and they you can read what the top general said two days ago we reported it
[16:27.520 --> 16:30.960]  here two days ago and yesterday you can just go read the full russian
[16:30.960 --> 16:34.640]  transcript or watch the video translated it's up on info wars.com
[16:34.640 --> 16:40.160]  prismplanet.com but he he laid out look here's the nato
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.240]  doctrine he read from it they say since 2000 they have a preamp of strike on
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.760]  Russia they're encircling us with what they call a missile
[16:47.760 --> 16:51.040]  defense shield but it's an anti-missile system so that if they begin
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.200]  nuking us or bombing us from the air or using cruise missiles and we try to
[16:55.200 --> 16:59.600]  strike back this destroys the concept of mad
[16:59.600 --> 17:02.400]  and the russian general said we would like to go back to mutually assured
[17:02.400 --> 17:08.720]  destruction where of any one party sneak attacks the other
[17:08.720 --> 17:12.000]  they will then be destroyed by reciprocal attacks
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.680]  but now you're rolling anti-missile systems in
[17:15.680 --> 17:18.960]  right up to our borders so that you can sneak attack us
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.840]  and if we try to counter strike you've got anti-missile missiles
[17:23.840 --> 17:30.320]  service to air anti-missile missiles and they said please we don't want this
[17:30.320 --> 17:33.680]  doctrine we don't like it you're encircling us you're sneak attacking
[17:33.680 --> 17:36.080]  us he looks totally great this isn't an act
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.000]  i mean they're being legitimate you watch our generals they're a bunch of
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.760]  primping uh arrogant lying scum on average
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.800]  nothing but lies comes out of their mouth and i've been analyzing Russia folks
[17:46.800 --> 17:50.320]  they've been doing nothing but telling the truth i have a responsibility to come
[17:50.320 --> 17:53.520]  here and tell you i've been studying this six seven hours a day two three
[17:53.520 --> 17:56.160]  hours in the morning three four hours at night
[17:56.160 --> 18:00.160]  i am i got a staff a few people looking all the stuff well i mean it is a fact
[18:00.160 --> 18:03.360]  the russians are being truthful
[18:04.240 --> 18:08.320]  and the united states and nato and israel are lying about everything it is
[18:08.320 --> 18:11.760]  incredible i mean the georgian president went on
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.840]  tv friday and said we're under attack a sneak attack
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.920]  by russia for no reason and our news all announced it
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.440]  for five minutes when we first put the tv on during the show
[18:25.440 --> 18:28.400]  and all the headlines said russia attacks george i said wow russia's gone
[18:28.400 --> 18:31.840]  to george i know u.s forces were there i know they were trying to take over an
[18:31.840 --> 18:34.720]  area but man this is incredible and then five minutes later we were able to
[18:34.720 --> 18:37.360]  get it right and go wait a minute all these articles a minute the bottom
[18:37.360 --> 18:40.560]  after a sneak attack by georgia but that but
[18:40.560 --> 18:45.280]  mckayl shasvely he goes on tv and says we're under attack help us oh it's
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.640]  horrible oh my god out of the blue no reason sneak attack
[18:53.760 --> 18:56.960]  meanwhile he's still saying russian forces are in the center of the country
[18:56.960 --> 19:00.400]  when they pull back as they said they do he's lying there
[19:00.400 --> 19:05.120]  nothing he says has any connection to reality
[19:05.120 --> 19:09.280]  and i see a scared russian general and by scared you know he's a big old
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.040]  big guy old man he's saying look you're encircling us with weapons
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.440]  you the nato's doctrine is a sneak nuke attack on us and that is their doctrine
[19:17.440 --> 19:24.560]  since 2000 he said stop it stop encircling us with nukes
[19:24.560 --> 19:27.920]  what do you think caused the cuban missile crisis when the u.s moved nukes
[19:27.920 --> 19:32.960]  into turkey but our media was so controlled no one was ever told that
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.760]  folks i love my children i don't want world war three
[19:37.760 --> 19:42.160]  and they're now escalating in poland escalating in ukraine
[19:42.160 --> 19:45.520]  saying they may start fights on the russian border ladies and gentlemen

[23:59.840 --> 24:03.200]  play that clip later russia says pollen risk
[24:03.200 --> 24:06.640]  nuclear attack because of us missiles being moved in around them
[24:06.640 --> 24:10.960]  let's go to the russian top foreign minister
[24:10.960 --> 24:14.720]  in a press conference yesterday you'll hear it translated into english
[24:14.720 --> 24:17.760]  and i'm just going to play about four minutes of this he's totally truthful
[24:17.760 --> 24:21.360]  everything he says is the truth we verified it independently
[24:21.360 --> 24:24.160]  and even in the mainstream news in the bottom of the articles they admit all
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.320]  this but they lie in the tops of the articles here it is
[24:28.320 --> 24:34.320]  president sakashvili go i'm sure sakashvili can no longer be a
[24:34.320 --> 24:37.760]  responsible partner in talks because everything this man has been saying
[24:37.760 --> 24:40.480]  recently doesn't correspond to a single fact
[24:40.480 --> 24:44.400]  as for the political assessments he makes based on lies he tells daily
[24:44.400 --> 24:48.160]  they're absolutely disturbing i'm sure he is a provocator
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.840]  the man who traitorously gave orders to start the mass shelling of cities
[24:51.840 --> 24:55.360]  with multiple rocket launchers to make artillery strikes
[24:55.360 --> 24:59.920]  and airstrikes on civilian areas of ciambali speaks from tv screens
[24:59.920 --> 25:03.280]  showing off with an eu flag in the background saying he was defending
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.600]  american values here i believe it is obvious to everyone that these
[25:07.600 --> 25:11.120]  statements are cynical those who try to defend him understand
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.840]  that it is a losing game who is the contact person in georgia
[25:15.840 --> 25:20.160]  then if georgia remains a party in the talks if you do not see sakashvili as
[25:20.160 --> 25:23.600]  negotiator
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.840]  sometimes this question has no answer at all for example yesterday and need
[25:27.840 --> 25:30.960]  emerge to have another conversation with the georgian foreign minister
[25:30.960 --> 25:35.280]  keselashvili we've been in contact over the last days on the phone
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.040]  yesterday took several hours to get her released on one of the phone numbers of
[25:39.040 --> 25:42.640]  the georgian foreign ministry we talked with her so we have
[25:42.640 --> 25:45.840]  communications channels and my deputy is in constant
[25:45.840 --> 25:48.880]  contact with his counterpart in the georgian foreign ministry
[25:48.880 --> 25:54.080]  so we keep talking mr. labrach concerning georgia's territorial
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.160]  integrity and the future status of south asetia and of carzia
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.640]  russian deputy prime minister Sergei Ivanov when speaking with the bbc
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.200]  says that it could be discussed so the issue is not out of the scope of
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.360]  discussions
[26:13.920 --> 26:17.360]  of course when michael sakashvili became president for the first time
[26:17.360 --> 26:20.480]  his means of coming to power in georgia was quite original
[26:20.480 --> 26:25.360]  after elections it was in 2003 from his first days as president he has been
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.120]  saying his goal is to reinstate georgia's territorial integrity
[26:29.120 --> 26:32.880]  in other words to settle conflicts in south asetia and of carzia
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.600]  that go back to the past and deep into history you can see how it has all been
[26:37.600 --> 26:40.480]  developing but what caused the situation in recent
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.000]  years originates from decisions by the first president of an independent
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.160]  georgia after the collapse of the soviet union it was mr. gamsahulia who
[26:48.160 --> 26:51.840]  issued a motto georgia for georgians he sent georgian
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.000]  troops to sukhumi and skin valley when he was annoyed by the afghazian south
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.720]  asetian protest against his decision to abolish their
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.480]  autonomies the war started you know what happened next
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.480]  the georgian troops were dislodged and peacekeeping mechanisms were agreed
[27:06.480 --> 27:09.840]  then with the help of russia who paid with the blood of their soldiers for
[27:09.840 --> 27:12.480]  that peacekeeping and negotiating structures and
[27:12.480 --> 27:15.840]  mechanisms were agreed we hope that would allow decision
[27:15.840 --> 27:19.200]  making that would help preserve georgia as a single state
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.560]  at the same time they provided for the rights and freedoms of south asetians
[27:22.560 --> 27:25.600]  and abkhazians based on the principles of autonomies
[27:25.600 --> 27:28.960]  the fact that mr. sakashvili has tried many times to get rid of these
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.280]  negotiating mechanisms violated agreements reached in this framework
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.280]  and made attempts to settle the conflicts by force speaks for itself
[27:37.280 --> 27:41.120]  as for methods today's leader of georgia uses to fulfill his mission of
[27:41.120 --> 27:44.880]  gathering of georgian lands i have brought a quotation with me
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.400]  one of the journalists told me that sakashvili was speaking live on february
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.720]  25th 2006 he said i will not give orders to launch a military
[27:52.720 --> 27:56.000]  operation i do not want any people to die because the
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.560]  repercussions of blood spilled in the caucuses will last not only for decades
[28:00.560 --> 28:05.200]  but for centuries will reach the go through talks and consultations
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.120]  so it's clear he told a lie but one thing he got right
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.560]  the consequences will last for centuries not decades
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.840]  so we can now start counting centuries from august 8 2008
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.080]  the wounds sakashvili has inflicted are deep and the healing process will be
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.520]  long what we've kept telling mr. sakashvili all these years
[28:25.520 --> 28:28.960]  is that he should learn to speak patiently and respectfully to the people
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.640]  whom he considers to be his citizens whom he considers to be his
[28:32.640 --> 28:35.520]  compatriots he has definitely failed to do that
[28:35.520 --> 28:39.520]  you know what he has done instead mr. sakashvili is causing great damage not
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.440]  only to south asetians and abkhazians but also to georgians
[28:43.440 --> 28:46.480]  his own people if ethnic terms are to be used
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.080]  what did he do for the georgian state as a result of this adventure
[28:50.080 --> 28:53.600]  before that georgian enclaves in south asetian territory
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.840]  in spite of all the problems and difficulties georgian people used to
[28:57.840 --> 29:00.960]  live there the peacekeeping forces included a georgian
[29:00.960 --> 29:04.000]  battalion alongside a russian and south asetian one
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.400]  he was really present in south asetia he could have used it to increase trust
[29:08.400 --> 29:12.880]  and dialogue and communication on how to settle those problems together
[29:12.880 --> 29:16.160]  such an agreement was reached at the joint control commission a year and a
[29:16.160 --> 29:19.040]  half ago on forming a joint south asetian working
[29:19.040 --> 29:22.960]  group to develop the settlement plan then he just cancelled that agreement
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.160]  he could have worked honestly within the existing format which would have
[29:26.160 --> 29:29.200]  definitely taken a long time but it was the only way
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.800]  towards all right we'll be right back with michelle chastodosky and i'm
[29:32.800 --> 29:43.680]  going to finish up some of these clips as well
