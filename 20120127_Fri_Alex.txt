[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.200 --> 00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.840 --> 00:39.440]  Alex Jones
[00:39.440 --> 00:45.840]  okay strap yourselves in yet again we always save the best for last and it is
[00:45.840 --> 00:54.280]  Friday the 27th day of January 2012 hard to believe that when we're back with you
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.640]  next week will be into the second month of 2012 that's only 11 months left on
[00:59.640 --> 01:02.840]  planet Earth before we're all dead because the Mayans who couldn't even
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.920]  invent a wheel said so actually they were amazing mathematicians and had a
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.640]  very interesting culture and took hallucinogens almost daily their
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.200]  leadership did and actually they didn't say that the world's gonna end at 2012
[01:17.200 --> 01:22.760]  that's when the age ends they believe but I don't put stock in superstition
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.520]  but the establishment certainly does and they're trying to start wars bring in
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.960]  the New World Order all of this and using this is a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.200]  2012 and the rest of it and the mainline Christian Church is always saying it's
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.240]  the end of the world every five minutes so everybody stands down imagine of our
[01:42.240 --> 01:45.920]  forebearers always thought it was the end of the world and didn't get involved
[01:45.920 --> 01:50.280]  in fighting evil where we'd be all I know is it could be the end of the world
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.960]  next month I doubt it you know Jesus Christ could come back tomorrow like a
[01:54.960 --> 02:00.680]  thief in the night I'm still going to confront corruption because I can't
[02:00.680 --> 02:06.360]  control myself I am compelled to do it and not because I have some instinct of
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.560]  being a goody two-shoes and I'm so great and wonderful it's because I can't stand
[02:11.560 --> 02:18.200]  evil corrupt control freak liars I like to teach people how to do things I like
[02:18.200 --> 02:24.880]  to build things I like beautiful things I like the good guys I believe in
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.480]  humanity and I see the corrupt manipulators for what they are and they
[02:30.480 --> 02:39.080]  drive me crazy and I don't like them so that's why I do what I do I feel violent
[02:39.080 --> 02:45.280]  towards evil people I feel quite frankly hateful but I do what I do because I
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.160]  love innocence I was looking at my three-year-old daughter this morning
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.320]  with a ponytail up on the top of her head I mean just a spitting image of a
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.760]  doll and sweeter than anything you can imagine we've also got a puppy that runs
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.400]  around hissing and biting and making cute noises I mean it's like this planet
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.440]  is just covered with incredible stuff wonderful entities that I want to
[03:09.440 --> 03:16.640]  protect from injustice from barbarism from war I don't like it
[03:17.400 --> 03:22.840]  and I will fight fire with fire and that's what we're doing here my friends
[03:22.840 --> 03:29.560]  we're not playing games okay I'm already ranting we've got two special news
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.800]  reports one of which premiered last night on the nightly news but I'm gonna
[03:33.800 --> 03:38.840]  give you a more concise focused commentary on it when we come back
[03:38.840 --> 03:45.160]  that's confirmed rendition Center FEMA camps in the United States and the the
[03:45.160 --> 03:50.000]  camps where they take you on the buses and the army trucks to then interrogate
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.120]  and send people for execution send people for foreign interrogation and
[03:54.120 --> 03:59.840]  torture and re-education or domestic or just those that they want to arrest with
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.320]  quote dissidents so people think that they're actually a good guy to insert
[04:04.320 --> 04:10.200]  spies within the resistance and there's some other subsets as well it's also
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.640]  just scaring people into serving the system when they take them to the camps
[04:13.640 --> 04:16.520]  so four different groups of people historically that are brought to the
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.080]  camps through the globalist interrogation methods that I have
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.800]  infiltrated and observed in police day 2000 you can see me get into the Marine
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.680]  Corps interrogation training center and the spokesman the civilian spokesman
[04:29.680 --> 04:33.880]  following me around all day freaked out said don't video this get out of here
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.920]  that's it you're thrown out of here thrown out of the area of Oakland they

[08:40.880 --> 08:48.520]  dealing with the fact that FEMA camp rendition federal kidnapping hub sites
[08:48.520 --> 08:55.280]  have been identified and of course not only have we identified a new site I've
[08:55.280 --> 08:58.800]  made some phone calls and done some checking in it indeed is some type of
[08:58.800 --> 09:06.400]  high-security prisoner extraction holding facility at LAX but it mirrors
[09:06.400 --> 09:10.920]  other facilities at Bergstrom International in Austin the old Robert
[09:10.920 --> 09:17.920]  Mueller Pier 57 in New York all of it I'm gonna recap that and then get into
[09:17.920 --> 09:26.160]  these reports here in just a moment but coming up in the second hour author and
[09:26.160 --> 09:32.160]  researcher and former political prisoner author of bloodlines of the Illuminati
[09:32.160 --> 09:38.120]  Fritz spring Meyer will be joining us then we have dr. Stan Monteith he'll be
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.200]  riding shotgun with us with Bob Chapman during his weekly visit rarely does
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.300]  Monteith actually contact us and say hey I want to come on he said he's talked to
[09:48.300 --> 09:54.780]  a CFR individual and has some big Intel on the upcoming strike on Iran speaking
[09:54.780 --> 09:59.340]  of that Iran is saying they're gonna let the UN IAEA back into inspector nuclear
[09:59.340 --> 10:06.720]  sites Israel says that they're bluffing on attacks and will basically back off
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.720]  if pressures continually put on them that's in the New York Times and
[10:10.720 --> 10:17.760]  Jerusalem Post gold prices are soaring on Fed news and other factors they've
[10:17.760 --> 10:20.100]  announced they're gonna start quantitative easing three that means
[10:20.100 --> 10:25.480]  big-time inflation there's also reports that GDP actually imploded in the last
[10:25.480 --> 10:31.880]  year 1.2% and that's even with cook numbers also they're spinning leaked
[10:31.880 --> 10:36.760]  video that shows Rand Paul wasn't
[10:36.920 --> 10:48.200]  basically I rate at the facility and that he was detained it shows him in a
[10:48.200 --> 10:52.380]  cubicle with police around it keeping him there and and the TSA's released a
[10:52.380 --> 10:57.240]  small clip of it acting like that's the entirety of how long Rand Paul was there
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.160]  when he said it was close to two hours and witnesses have said that so there
[11:02.160 --> 11:08.000]  it's incredible how they will spend things that is coming up as well Obama
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.320]  accused of contempt of court in birther hearing secretary of state warns Obama a
[11:15.320 --> 11:20.200]  mishearing at your own peril they are trying to make him show up for this
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.040]  hearing to prove his citizenship we know he did have a fake Social Security
[11:24.040 --> 11:27.960]  number of somebody else's out of Connecticut we do know his files are
[11:27.960 --> 11:32.680]  sealed we do know he went by other names we do know his entire family was CIA
[11:32.680 --> 11:35.680]  continuing
[11:37.120 --> 11:43.960]  with some of that news we'll be breaking that down with Obama and his car company
[11:43.960 --> 11:48.560]  that he's backed with the battery-operated system is filing for
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.800]  bankruptcy that was just basically a shell corporation that they used to pay
[11:52.800 --> 11:59.340]  off some of their political contributors so that's all coming up today and a lot
[11:59.340 --> 12:05.360]  more also there's a big manufactured controversy really it's a jealousy issue
[12:05.360 --> 12:13.280]  by the king of the terrible dinosaur media the globalist media New York Times
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.560]  more and more becoming a non-issue just just dwindling and shriveling up to
[12:19.560 --> 12:22.800]  nothing like a vampire that's hit by the Sun at high noon
[12:22.800 --> 12:29.800]  conservatives criticized drudge for anti-genrich assault and all drudge did
[12:29.800 --> 12:35.560]  the last three days was linked to all of the major conservative sites from the
[12:35.560 --> 12:44.840]  Washington Times to Forbes to I mean you name it National Review pointing out
[12:44.840 --> 12:52.000]  that Genrich has been for open borders carbon taxes called for global
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.320]  government all this stuff I mean that's who Newt
[12:55.320 --> 13:02.680]  Genrich is and so the New York Times is acting like conservatives are mad at the
[13:02.680 --> 13:07.080]  drudge report when these aren't conservatives that are defending Newt
[13:07.080 --> 13:13.320]  Genrich I mean it is ridiculous to claim that conservatives are defending Newt
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.960]  Genrich Newt Genrich is a joke and let me let me get this straight I don't like
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.160]  Mitt Romney he's for carbon taxes he's been for abortion in the past he wrote
[13:23.160 --> 13:29.360]  Obamacare he's a globalist big-time but he's not as evil as Newt Genrich I mean
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.240]  Newt Genrich is anti-family anti-us sovereignty and has written articles
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.320]  that I've read on air calling for it that the so-called conservatives that
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.560]  are attacking him they're just more rhinos Genrich is so extreme that rhinos
[13:43.560 --> 13:49.660]  don't even like him okay and so the New York Times claim conservatives
[13:49.660 --> 13:54.180]  criticized drudge for anti-genrich assault furious conservatives have taken
[13:54.180 --> 13:59.040]  to blogs and Twitter on Thursday to vent their ire against what they allege is
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.480]  conspiratorial dumping of twisted and manipulative negative attacks on Newt
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.840]  Genrich see when you can think for yourself it's called a conspiracy it's
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.160]  called conspiracy theory
[14:13.160 --> 14:22.520]  and it makes my head spin that this type of stuff goes on now it has come out
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.540]  it's been all over the news the last week that almost all of Genrich's
[14:26.540 --> 14:31.000]  Twitter responses in fact Aaron was showing me in the article he was like 90
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.200]  something percent guys print 90% I don't know the exact percent it's 90 plus but
[14:37.200 --> 14:45.140]  just say 90% type in fake Genrich Twitter responses and it'll it'll pop up
[14:45.140 --> 14:48.980]  that's the same thing with Romney it's the same thing with all these guys and
[14:48.980 --> 14:52.880]  it's come out that Romney and Genrich that their crowds are almost completely
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.800]  paid for and fake and when he doesn't have paid people that then he has no one
[14:58.800 --> 15:03.240]  there for him and then Ron Paul's this rock star there's election fraud in South
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.760]  Carolina folks there was election fraud in Iowa there's gonna be election fraud
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.920]  in Florida Ron Paul is the front-runner every article I go to I type in Ron Paul
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.840]  into search engine a couple times a day every article is five to one ten to one
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.560]  you name it for Ron Paul in articles attacking him in neutral articles you
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.760]  name it in articles that don't mention Ron Paul they're about Mitt Romney and
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.600]  Genrich it's all Ron Paul supporters I mean it's a fraud it's a hoax just like
[15:33.600 --> 15:38.200]  the New York Times is a hoax the New York Times makes hundreds of millions of
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.480]  dollars a year last time I checked is like 500 million a year and they still
[15:43.480 --> 15:47.040]  had a shortfall of hundreds of millions and they have less visitors in the
[15:47.040 --> 15:50.480]  Drudge Report and the Drudge Report probably makes four or five million a
[15:50.480 --> 16:00.520]  year again it's a hoax infowars.com dozens of times bigger than msnbc.com we
[16:00.520 --> 16:05.520]  make a fraction of what they do because when the global corporate sellout slug
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.120]  New World Order trash
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.500]  yeah there it is report Time magazine 92% of Newt Genrich's Twitter followers
[16:14.500 --> 16:25.200]  aren't real anyways there it is so the globalist tithe to the media they know
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.260]  it's a failure they know it doesn't make money they know it's not popular they
[16:29.260 --> 16:36.480]  they pay for it so that there's at least an echo chamber of propaganda I mean how
[16:36.480 --> 16:43.000]  is that how is it that infowars.com conservatively last time I checked the
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.080]  metric gets about 50 plus times the traffic of the austin-american statesman
[16:48.080 --> 16:53.720]  and the austin-american statesman makes tens upon tens upon tens of millions of
[16:53.720 --> 16:58.080]  dollars I think last time I checked you know it's it's grossing something like
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.800]  50 60 million a year I forget you pull it up just like I forget if it's 90 or 92
[17:02.800 --> 17:07.700]  it's 92% of his Twitter followers are fake all I know is is that I'm much
[17:07.700 --> 17:12.580]  bigger than a big giant building full of all these employees that no one reads
[17:12.580 --> 17:18.000]  no one trusts and no one listens to but it's the Emperor's new clothes everybody
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.280]  goes along with it that they're the biggest thing in the world so everyone
[17:21.280 --> 17:27.840]  just bows down to it all day like it is all right I'm I'm digressing here I just
[17:27.840 --> 17:34.120]  read an article like this and it is the the the discredited New York Times that
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.640]  is hanging on by its fingernails to any readership any credibility any anything
[17:39.640 --> 17:43.080]  and that's why they're gonna try to shut down freedom on the web that's why
[17:43.080 --> 17:47.320]  they're delisting info wars and prison planet from Google news that's why
[17:47.320 --> 17:50.560]  they're censoring us on military bases and government buildings all over the
[17:50.560 --> 17:56.880]  world they're censoring us folks because they're scared to death they know we are
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.500]  absolutely on a tilted football field going uphill getting touchdowns beating
[18:02.500 --> 18:06.640]  them so they just want to shut down the entire game even though we're going
[18:06.640 --> 18:13.800]  uphill dragging balls and chains behind us they want to shut down the entire
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.840]  game and just flip the field straight up so we fall down into Hades basically

[20:00.240 --> 20:04.560]  is take us down with them and shut us down because they're in total panic
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.600]  that's why the White House regulations ours back in the news saying shut down
[20:08.600 --> 20:13.200]  people that don't agree with them shut down websites that criticize electric
[20:13.200 --> 20:16.960]  cars he was in the news two days ago saying that I mean you talk about
[20:16.960 --> 20:23.560]  Twilight zone tyrant level control freak spasms and temper tantrums publicly but
[20:23.560 --> 20:27.640]  these scum are in control they've hijacked the country so just because
[20:27.640 --> 20:31.840]  everybody knows they're a pack of lion crooks doesn't mean that we're not in
[20:31.840 --> 20:37.200]  deep trouble oh it makes me want to throw up and worse news out today EU
[20:37.200 --> 20:45.080]  signs the act global internet censorship treaty all the European countries have
[20:45.080 --> 20:49.000]  signed on Japan signed on they all love the censorship it's here get ready
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.640]  they're coming for us because they can't stand it they can't stand the fact that
[20:55.640 --> 20:58.880]  they can't sit there and be arrogant media whores anymore and that no one
[20:58.880 --> 21:05.920]  wants to listen to them now this is a breaking news report here these are
[21:05.920 --> 21:12.200]  excerpts from my film martial law my film police state to the takeover that's
[21:12.200 --> 21:21.920]  from 2000 and from martial law 2005 confirming that they have these FEMA
[21:21.920 --> 21:26.640]  funded hubs and Sandpoint naval brig in Seattle where they put political
[21:26.640 --> 21:32.240]  protesters under FEMA's control and then you tie that into the emergency centers
[21:32.240 --> 21:38.600]  Establishment Act and you tie that in to all the admissions that they have these
[21:38.600 --> 21:44.080]  hubs at airports like they have here in Austin at the old Robert Mueller and at
[21:44.080 --> 21:49.240]  the new airport Bergstrom they have these holding hubs with porta potties
[21:49.240 --> 21:53.400]  cots bolts and chains in the floor to hold political dissidents and this has
[21:53.400 --> 21:58.200]  been admitted for more than 13 years that we've known of when Rob do my
[21:58.200 --> 22:04.200]  reporter he's suing right now they're trying to settle with them Pittsburgh
[22:04.200 --> 22:08.520]  Pennsylvania over arresting him for videotaping from a hilltop them beating
[22:08.520 --> 22:12.000]  and arresting protesters they took them to a military base they had people
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.280]  getting off trucks with bags on their heads and the police were all there with
[22:15.280 --> 22:20.040]  the military shut up with the computer terminals running at all so military
[22:20.040 --> 22:26.600]  bases sports stadiums in fact that's in the news today about the sports stadiums
[22:26.600 --> 22:31.240]  that's in the Miami newspaper they want to put the homeless basically forcibly
[22:31.240 --> 22:39.280]  in the ballparks and stadiums that's Miami Herald so all of that's going on
[22:39.280 --> 22:45.600]  you got urban warfare drills everywhere and we get sent photos from LAX in an
[22:45.600 --> 22:49.360]  area and we went and checked the Google Earth I made some phone calls and
[22:49.360 --> 22:55.280]  confirmed it is an emergency center of the police and FEMA that's all police
[22:55.280 --> 22:59.680]  that I've talked to know and the word is it's going to be used to hold people to
[22:59.680 --> 23:03.040]  take them out to the airfield and split up and break up different groups that
[23:03.040 --> 23:07.080]  are going to rendition centers that are going to overseas torture camps that are
[23:07.080 --> 23:10.760]  being taken to other federal facilities so this is a rendition
[23:10.760 --> 23:17.240]  mothership area so I want to go to this video report from past and present it
[23:17.240 --> 23:22.360]  first starts out in 2004 in New York here it is we're in New York City right
[23:22.360 --> 23:26.960]  here on the Hudson River and this condemned former bus station where they
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.920]  stored the buses is being used to hold over 2,000 protesters and they admit
[23:31.920 --> 23:37.160]  that they randomly set up fences and scoop up whole crowds of people and then
[23:37.160 --> 23:42.120]  take them here and for over three days they've not let people talk to lawyers
[23:42.120 --> 23:46.400]  call out talk to their families some have been released some have gone to the
[23:46.400 --> 23:50.800]  hospital with rashes over their entire bodies this building is condemned the
[23:50.800 --> 23:55.940]  city admits it the bus union wouldn't allow them to use it years ago so they
[23:55.940 --> 23:59.000]  turned it into an emergency police facility it's full of asbestos
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.800]  chemicals oils from decades and decades and decades in this 70 year old building
[24:04.800 --> 24:09.140]  and the average day for someone scooped up in there is over 24 hours the city
[24:09.140 --> 24:14.040]  even admits that many of the nearly 2,000 protesters arrested over the past
[24:14.040 --> 24:18.320]  few days have been taken to an old bus depot on Manhattan's West Side but now
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.000]  the use of Pier 57 is a temporary holding facility is stirring up some
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.380]  controversy of its own protests are being held there to spotlight conditions
[24:26.380 --> 24:30.320]  some of those being detained say they're getting sick there are reports of
[24:30.320 --> 24:34.960]  cramped conditions rashes chemical burns and difficulty breathing we should call
[24:34.960 --> 24:38.920]  this facility what it is and it's a concentration camp it's the pier 57
[24:38.920 --> 24:43.360]  concentration camp the mayor has has the nerve and the police commissioner has a
[24:43.360 --> 24:47.200]  nerve to allow this to happen it's actually stick people in a in a oil
[24:47.200 --> 24:52.720]  filled garage with asbestos across the nation at airports and old military
[24:52.720 --> 24:58.160]  bases they're installing hangers and structures to in turn the American
[24:58.160 --> 25:02.560]  people under military control they're also integrating local police you've
[25:02.560 --> 25:07.840]  already seen some of the evidence but even the town where I live Austin Texas
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.240]  is not immune from these activities we're told there is a holding facility
[25:13.240 --> 25:21.280]  here on the old Robert Mueller Municipal Airport a hanger to hold people have you
[25:21.280 --> 25:23.960]  been inside there
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.800]  how did they fix it up well you probably don't recognize it but it's an abandoned
[25:30.800 --> 25:35.160]  hangar at the old airport just off 51st Street today and tomorrow sheriff's
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.640]  employees are turning this place into a booking center and even a holding cell
[25:39.640 --> 25:44.680]  now it really doesn't look like much and okay it's really not but it is a perfect
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.400]  place to set up shop anyone arrested in the Travis County area during the New
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.680]  Year's Eve party for a classy misdemeanor will be brought out here
[25:51.680 --> 25:55.920]  sheriff's officials tell me it's pretty primitive inmates will be fingerprinted
[25:55.920 --> 25:59.000]  and allowed to free phone calls then they'll be held here for about four
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.880]  hours just enough time to sober up then they'll be released and expected to
[26:02.880 --> 26:06.160]  appear in court in the future only people who have ID on them will be
[26:06.160 --> 26:09.280]  brought out here since they won't have the capability to run fingerprint checks
[26:09.280 --> 26:13.440]  and they're mostly expecting people arrested for public intoxication down on
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.200]  the a2k and 6th Street areas this temporary booking facility opens up for
[26:17.200 --> 26:23.760]  business tomorrow night that's Thursday at 8 o'clock we're hoping to get staff
[26:23.760 --> 26:27.720]  acclimated to working in this environment starting tomorrow with
[26:27.720 --> 26:34.280]  hopefully a lot low volume of arrests so hopefully by come Friday night everyone
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.160]  will know how the flow is going to work in here and be used to the holding cell
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.340]  is surrounded by this chain link fence and the fire marshal has told the
[26:42.340 --> 26:46.240]  sheriff's department that they can hold about 380 people in here and the sheriff's
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.840]  deputies are ready for a busy night anyone who got in their way was arrested
[26:50.840 --> 26:57.080]  and shipped to a FEMA Center the Federal Emergency Management Agency in direct
[26:57.080 --> 27:02.840]  violation of posse commentatis had Delta Force on the ground from day one of the
[27:02.840 --> 27:08.800]  demonstrations and protests continually integrating the local state county and
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.400]  city police under federal command this should be a giant red flag for any
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.960]  American concerned about their god-given rights and their freedom in this country
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.260]  at least 250 perhaps more and those that have been taken into custody from the
[27:25.260 --> 27:30.040]  streets of downtown Seattle protesting for a variety of reasons the world trade
[27:30.040 --> 27:33.760]  ministers here on their visit you see them here with their hands pretty much
[27:33.760 --> 27:38.880]  cuffed behind their backs with those plastic sort of strap handcuffed
[27:38.880 --> 27:44.280]  apparatus they are being led into the Sandpoint Brig remember we told you
[27:44.280 --> 27:47.240]  about this story dancing all the way in some cases we told you about this story
[27:47.240 --> 27:50.400]  a couple of weeks ago a number of the neighbors in that area of Sandpoint
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.600]  Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened
[27:54.600 --> 27:59.360]  just in case it was needed and it has been as we said at least 250 arrests now
[27:59.360 --> 28:04.640]  maybe more and we've seen 400 people arrested the facility at Sandpoint we're
[28:04.640 --> 28:08.680]  told this fall we're told they did not create another one at Boeing Field but
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.320]  they continue to arrest people and they continue to crack down hard on the
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.080]  protesters this afternoon the worst thing is is I finally saw something my
[28:17.080 --> 28:19.960]  own eyes it's one thing to talk about it here people talk about it on the radio
[28:19.960 --> 28:25.000]  there I saw this with my own eyes at LAX Los Angeles Airport they've built a
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.280]  giant human holding pen it's obvious quite obvious what it's for it's for
[28:31.280 --> 28:35.560]  processing people this thing they used to park all of our limousines and cars
[28:35.560 --> 28:39.360]  and buses at the eastern end of the north set of runways there's two sets of
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.080]  runways at LAX they used to park all of us at the eastern end of the north
[28:43.080 --> 28:47.120]  runway where the planes would land right over the top of us they moved us all out
[28:47.120 --> 28:50.440]  of there this past summer which I thought was strange what I saw was when
[28:50.440 --> 28:53.400]  I pulled in there and I was followed twice by the cops when I pulled in on
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.160]  the pictures this thing is it's a holding pen it could hold thousands of
[28:57.160 --> 29:01.280]  people it's right next to the tarmac there's no buildings no nothing it's
[29:01.280 --> 29:05.560]  like a 10 or 12 foot fence with a permanent concrete base around the base
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.800]  of it and there's two sets of barbed wire on top facing in and out so you
[29:10.800 --> 29:14.880]  know there's there's fences I got all over out the airport area actually have
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.120]  one of those at Bergstrom and at the old airport and then and I first reported it
[29:19.120 --> 29:24.200]  was a secret holding pan but the news said I was a conspiracy theorist but
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.560]  that it was to hold people during civil unrest so I'm bad for being right and
[29:28.560 --> 29:34.480]  breaking the news I don't get an award I'm bad cuz I'm right and it's kooky
[29:34.480 --> 29:38.520]  not to like it what's going on at the old airport this is where the party
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.840]  could end up Walt of a2k and y2k partiers do get out of hand these

[33:15.880 --> 33:20.680]  Aaron Dykes yesterday you can stand me and I don't know how you describe their
[33:20.680 --> 33:24.760]  incredible lies the only thing that isn't done is that I haven't titled this
[33:24.760 --> 33:32.740]  yet TSA defines deception the TSA are the world's biggest liars and the
[33:32.740 --> 33:38.640]  world's biggest liar award goes to the TSA I don't I don't know what title to

[34:04.420 --> 34:10.040]  footage of FEMA running the military and police putting citizens in a FEMA camp
[34:10.040 --> 34:19.160]  in Seattle FEMA ran setting up these same detainment facilities at the
[34:19.160 --> 34:24.680]  airports here in Austin they're still there and then sold it like well it's
[34:24.680 --> 34:28.280]  pretty rioting during you know Mardi Gras or during the the new year they
[34:28.280 --> 34:31.880]  just sit there but it was cops that told me about it I knew about it before was
[34:31.880 --> 34:39.240]  on the news and then we have this new report and the photos that were showing
[34:39.240 --> 34:42.880]  on the radio but we have the eyewitness there and we've done some research it is
[34:42.880 --> 34:50.240]  indeed a high-security area and is built on to the flight path so they can just
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.000]  put people on board the aircraft bar bar facing in and out turnstiles that are
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.600]  one-way prison style places for buses to pull in ultra super creepy and clearly a
[35:01.600 --> 35:08.320]  rendition Center so breaking FEMA camp rendition hubs discovered past and
[35:08.320 --> 35:11.320]  present now just played you newscast what they're saying
[35:11.320 --> 35:15.280]  FEMA's running putting the citizens in the naval brig and what does the
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.720]  emergency centers act say from last year they tried to pass they tried to just
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.100]  legalize what's already there in the bill that they'll use the old military
[35:23.100 --> 35:29.440]  bases Briggs under FEMA to hold people during emergencies and civil unrest what
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.380]  are they saying in the Miami Herald let's put all the homeless people in
[35:32.380 --> 35:35.680]  the sports stadiums what did I tell you was coming during the economic collapse
[35:35.680 --> 35:39.440]  it's all this has been done in other countries I've watched the congressional
[35:39.440 --> 35:42.920]  hearings on it I've read the emergency centers act I've read the military
[35:42.920 --> 35:48.280]  commissions act I've read the civilian inmate labor camp program declassified
[35:48.280 --> 35:55.200]  in 97 by Clinton they had u.s. prisoners in secret prisons run by the military
[35:55.200 --> 35:59.960]  regular u.s. prisoners for decades before Bill Clinton declassified it
[35:59.960 --> 36:06.480]  there's real camps already and you can't get the corporate dinosaur media to
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.480]  cover it they're now saying it's a conspiracy
[36:10.480 --> 36:14.040]  theory that drudge is linking to articles showing that Newt Gingrich
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.760]  isn't conservative that's mind control if you say lemon pie is lemon pie they
[36:19.760 --> 36:24.480]  go conspiracy if you say milk is white they say conspiracy you say sky is blue
[36:24.480 --> 36:29.280]  you have all the documents about FEMA camps and they're building the hubs
[36:29.280 --> 36:33.760]  everywhere and they look at you and say it's a conspiracy theory they talk to
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.160]  you like you're an idiot they're still saying there's no world government as
[36:38.160 --> 36:43.800]  it's being announced let's go back to the end of the piece this is going on
[36:43.800 --> 36:48.120]  right now at LAX here it is brand new turnstiles let me describe them because
[36:48.120 --> 36:51.880]  that you can say well it's part of an airport no these things are these are
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.600]  those big tubular steel turnstiles they go in they don't come back out there's
[36:56.600 --> 37:00.840]  no way to get back out there's four sets of them so there's like 16 turnstiles
[37:00.840 --> 37:05.320]  to go into this thing and it's like the size of three foot you can get thousands
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.760]  of people the weird thing about it that proves what it is is because there's an
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.160]  on the fence that goes to the under the tarmac if you go straight onto the
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.360]  airport tarmac where you know what kind of security is that they put a big black
[37:17.360 --> 37:23.200]  gate you can you can pull trucks buses whatever into this holding so it's built
[37:23.200 --> 37:28.280]  to move lots of people quickly into this pen and then move them onto the tarmac
[37:28.280 --> 37:32.760]  what does that work you know except to move people and put them on the aircraft
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.580]  that's like the Oklahoma City Federal Processing Center and this is this is
[37:37.580 --> 37:40.760]  actually all of the emergency centers established you can watch the rest of
[37:40.760 --> 37:45.920]  the report at info wars calm it's in the article by Kurt Nemo that just went up
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.200]  minutes ago FEMA camp rendition hubs discovered we're gonna Twitter this out
[37:50.200 --> 37:56.400]  as well please retweet it get this article out to everyone you know please
[37:56.400 --> 38:02.240]  and in it we've got KBR putting out the contracts to man the FEMA camps and
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.040]  admitting it's for civil unrest the barbed wire the stockades it's all
[38:06.040 --> 38:12.280]  there it's all proven in this article by Nemo with the video that this is a
[38:12.280 --> 38:15.880]  long-term program I gotta get Kurt to add the part about it they want to put
[38:15.880 --> 38:19.520]  the homeless and sports stadiums and lock them up at night for their own
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.660]  safety that's already happening in California in Sacramento I sent
[38:22.660 --> 38:27.000]  reporters there two years ago on that now shifting gears into another big
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.280]  report that we're premiering here on the radio and to those watching on prison
[38:31.280 --> 38:38.300]  planet TV this new special report breaks down just some of the lies of the
[38:38.300 --> 38:50.600]  incredibly manipulative and deceptive TSA here it is you to go places and half
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.760]  the time it takes to travel by car for some trips it'll be faster than flying
[38:55.760 --> 39:01.640]  without the pat down it's the sort of security we've seen a lot of since 9-11
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.640]  in places like airports and now here at the bus station I think credible recits
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.200]  threats that are causing what some believe to be these invasive invasive
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.440]  screening tactics Robin we know the threats are real and we've seen this
[39:15.440 --> 39:19.080]  latest information coming out of Al-Qaeda Arabian Peninsula remind
[39:19.080 --> 39:24.640]  Americans why we now check our liquids it's because a mother was willing to
[39:24.640 --> 39:28.880]  blow up the baby and the entire plane right with the liquids right the
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.640]  Department of Homeland Security has not been forthcoming with the public about
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.040]  the true extent of radiation risk advanced imaging technology would not
[39:37.040 --> 39:40.600]  have discovered the type of bond that Umar Farooq Abdul-Mattaled had had
[39:40.600 --> 39:47.040]  secreted in his underwear well I think legal people may may disagree on that we
[39:47.040 --> 39:50.520]  are not retaining we are not keeping they're not designed for that at all
[39:50.520 --> 39:55.320]  the TSA is reiterating today that although its machines can store images
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.200]  when they're being tested quote all functionality to store export or print
[40:00.200 --> 40:06.360]  images is disabled throughout history and in every culture there is a basic
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.960]  precept of law that if someone has been caught lying before what's the
[40:11.960 --> 40:16.120]  difference between lying and misleading Congress it all has to do with your
[40:16.120 --> 40:20.200]  state of mind and whether or not you had the requisite intent to come up with
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.600]  something that can be considered perjury or a lie you should not believe anything
[40:24.600 --> 40:38.040]  else that they tell you and when someone has been confirmed to be a congenital or
[40:38.040 --> 40:45.880]  serial liar you are a fool to believe anything they say it has been months and
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.280]  you tell me that you're not you weren't you weren't doing it because of an IG
[40:50.280 --> 41:02.400]  investigation let's go through a few questions here madam you know about the
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.640]  TSA and their pension for molesting children raping women in parking lots
[41:07.640 --> 41:13.480]  robbing luggage stealing cash out of wallets beating people up and then lying
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.160]  about them you know about their pension for child porn and the incredible
[41:19.160 --> 41:24.000]  statistical analysis that we've seen that they are predisposed to engage in
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.040]  crime no kidding who else wants a job groping men women and children all day
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.360]  and making old ladies who can't walk crawl out of wheelchairs and ripping
[41:34.360 --> 41:39.640]  colostomy bags off of people's sides who else wants to abuse people all day but
[41:39.640 --> 41:45.960]  criminals and control freaks but in this report I want to look at just some of
[41:45.960 --> 41:49.720]  their lies because they're constantly lying and the
[41:49.720 --> 41:55.960]  prostitute trader stream media that serves the globalist and these brown
[41:55.960 --> 42:01.920]  shirts of the federal takeover need to all be called on the carpet now let's
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.280]  just look at the latest lie that came out today the Tennessee and newspaper
[42:06.280 --> 42:12.880]  reports Nashville Airport video doesn't show irate senator Rand Paul and they
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.320]  linked to the video and there is Paul being completely calm with the police
[42:17.320 --> 42:21.560]  they're now also having to admit that he was attained for more than an hour and a
[42:21.560 --> 42:26.800]  half as he said he was which under common law is a custodial arrest so
[42:26.800 --> 42:30.760]  there you have it within minutes of this being put out by Ron Paul in his Twitter
[42:30.760 --> 42:35.480]  the New York Times talked to the TSA and said he wasn't even stopped for five
[42:35.480 --> 42:42.860]  minutes he's a liar and he was irate and the police put in their report part of
[42:42.860 --> 42:49.480]  this culture of lying that he was irate all lies by a group of people that lie
[42:49.480 --> 42:55.640]  and lie and lie some more and then of course lie some more and we have the
[42:55.640 --> 43:01.220]  White House siding with the TSA we have Rush Limbaugh coming out saying oh his
[43:01.220 --> 43:05.560]  dad's like a Muslim terrorist you know let's start the groping you know after
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.680]  all he flies on he flies on private jets but let's look at some of the TSA lies
[43:10.680 --> 43:17.720]  that affect us all radiation they've had studies back in the late 1990s from
[43:17.720 --> 43:20.560]  these same systems that's why they weren't deployed all over the world
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.640]  these things have been around for decades that they're massively linked
[43:23.640 --> 43:27.400]  to different types of cancer so John Hopkins and many other prestigious
[43:27.400 --> 43:30.760]  universities come out and put out reports the last few years saying our
[43:30.760 --> 43:34.420]  studies show this stuff can give you cancer I mean the scans are so powerful
[43:34.420 --> 43:38.040]  you can see the skeleton bones in the fingers I mean it's it's high-powered
[43:38.040 --> 43:44.080]  and all these studies come out so the TSA comes out and says John's Hopkins
[43:44.080 --> 43:48.520]  says it's totally safe and the head of John's Hopkins radiology department
[43:48.520 --> 43:53.520]  comes out and says our study actually says the opposite and the TSA doesn't
[43:53.520 --> 43:58.080]  correct their mistake because it's not a mistake they are a pack of criminal out
[43:58.080 --> 44:03.400]  of control 10th amendment violating and Fourth Amendment violating goons who
[44:03.400 --> 44:07.260]  are now setting up checkpoints on the highways of America and that's why the
[44:07.260 --> 44:12.520]  feds don't care how much anger or how many tens of billions in tourism the TSA
[44:12.520 --> 44:16.400]  destroys from foreigners that won't come here and Americans like myself that
[44:16.400 --> 44:20.520]  won't travel because I won't have my family groped because they're getting
[44:20.520 --> 44:24.480]  ready to be all over the United States they're gonna hire your local police
[44:24.480 --> 44:29.120]  that's been announced they're going to run checkpoints mobile vans it's already
[44:29.120 --> 44:32.360]  happening so you think you're just not gonna fly and get away with this oh
[44:32.360 --> 44:36.760]  sorry there's plenty of people that couldn't hold a job at McDonald's that
[44:36.760 --> 44:42.320]  are going to be officer and agent TSA and your wife your wife's in deep
[44:42.320 --> 44:46.520]  trouble and your children they're in even deeper trouble psychologists have
[44:46.520 --> 44:51.600]  come out and pointed out the TSA groping of children is actually training them
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.080]  that when pedophiles touch them to test and see if they've been acclimated for
[44:56.080 --> 45:00.680]  rape that they will submit to the touching and not say no and what's the
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.760]  TSA say they say we don't think that's the case and again a lot of the public
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.800]  and say everything's okay and claim despite the fact that there are hundreds
[45:10.800 --> 45:15.360]  of videos and photos showing them taking baby's diapers off and going in the
[45:15.360 --> 45:19.600]  pants of small children they come out and say over and over again for three
[45:19.600 --> 45:24.680]  years we do not go in the clothes or even through the clothes and touch
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.320]  genitals of under 12 and then hundreds of videos come out and they say okay
[45:29.320 --> 45:36.360]  we're gonna stop last time they said that was in November 2010 and continued
[45:36.360 --> 45:41.440]  it over and over again and said again we won't do it continued it lying lying
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.560]  lying first they say it's not groping and sexual assault then they say they're
[45:46.560 --> 45:51.400]  not doing it then they say they're going to stop doing it and continue it over
[45:51.400 --> 45:56.240]  and over again lying about radiation lying about groping lying about the
[45:56.240 --> 45:59.840]  sexual assault lying about the statistics on how many other people are
[45:59.840 --> 46:03.240]  caught engaged in every crime you can imagine but then you see bizarre
[46:03.240 --> 46:08.080]  statements on the TSA blog and in their press releases saying there's hardly any
[46:08.080 --> 46:14.200]  complaints why hardly anyone is against this and we only pat down 2% which is a
[46:14.200 --> 46:19.400]  total lie I fly all the time I'm forced to as a journalist I fly a lot my crew
[46:19.400 --> 46:24.480]  flies a lot and in hundreds of flights total we've estimated that at least a
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.080]  third of the people where we fly are groped including most people who are put
[46:29.080 --> 46:33.240]  through the naked body scanners so they're lying to you about radiation
[46:33.240 --> 46:36.420]  they're lying to you about groping and sexual assault they're lying and saying
[46:36.420 --> 46:39.520]  they're gonna stop doing it to children or they say they never did it to
[46:39.520 --> 46:44.800]  children or they say they didn't go in the pants of Miss USA and then she goes
[46:44.800 --> 46:49.080]  and gets the video and they admit they did it but let's continue a few months
[46:49.080 --> 46:53.320]  ago a whole bunch of 85 and 90 year old women many of which couldn't even get
[46:53.320 --> 46:56.480]  out of their wheelchairs started reporting that they were taken behind
[46:56.480 --> 47:00.440]  closed doors and made to take all their clothes off and the TSA came out and
[47:00.440 --> 47:06.000]  said you're lying we don't do that and then so many people went public that
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.760]  they said well we do take you behind closed doors and take your clothes off
[47:08.760 --> 47:15.440]  we don't call it a strip search and then even in their apology the women who've
[47:15.440 --> 47:20.280]  been assaulted by them say it's all lies I mean it's lies within lies within lies
[47:20.280 --> 47:25.720]  within lies but what do you expect from a federal brown shirt goon force meant
[47:25.720 --> 47:29.760]  to dog train us and break our will to basically live like maximum security
[47:29.760 --> 47:34.480]  prisoners they're coming to malls highway checkpoints are already there
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.360]  sporting games we're all being trained to have government put their hands on us
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.800]  and TSA is now training for forced inoculation federal grants to local
[47:42.800 --> 47:45.960]  police they're training of a force inoculation that's why they're doing
[47:45.960 --> 47:49.560]  this that's why they're they're lying to the American people because we're seen
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.080]  as an enemy and you lie to an enemy in warfare this is a foreign banking
[47:54.080 --> 47:59.340]  cartel occupying the United States and the TSA is their shock troops to
[47:59.340 --> 48:04.080]  bureaucratically go out there and train us to accept this in just the last week
[48:04.080 --> 48:07.800]  Homeland Security has come out and said we're not just about terror we're gonna
[48:07.800 --> 48:11.880]  hire your local police we're gonna certify who can get jobs anywhere we're
[48:11.880 --> 48:16.440]  gonna set up checkpoints in your town we're gonna have spies all over Twitter
[48:16.440 --> 48:19.900]  and Facebook we're gonna have citizen spies on the ground recording what you
[48:19.900 --> 48:27.800]  say politically they are recreating classical hardcore despotism this is 200
[48:27.800 --> 48:34.120]  proof evil this is certified as bad as it gets it's conscious takeover oh and
[48:34.120 --> 48:39.000]  also they said that the machines could not physically hold images the machines
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.560]  are not set to store images they're not set to transmit images and then we got
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.040]  the manuals sent to us by insiders that said that when they test the machines
[48:49.040 --> 48:54.440]  they look to see if they can see the genitals and that that is the marker
[48:54.440 --> 48:58.000]  they look for to make sure that the machine is tuned right and then indeed
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.380]  all the images are saved not just at airports but at courthouses and have
[49:02.380 --> 49:06.560]  been leaked and shared and they pin them up on the wall and when they see a good
[49:06.560 --> 49:09.920]  looking woman it's come out they put them through so they lied about saving
[49:09.920 --> 49:13.020]  the images there have been cases in England where they come up to famous
[49:13.020 --> 49:18.960]  film stars and ask them to sign scans of their own genitals this is really
[49:18.960 --> 49:23.880]  happening and of course it's a bunch of abusers that are willing to take these
[49:23.880 --> 49:29.240]  jobs remember that basic precept in law that if someone's been caught lying
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.420]  before don't believe anything they say and they're criminals what do they say
[49:33.420 --> 49:37.120]  about the devil he's the father of lies well you believe in the devil or not
[49:37.120 --> 49:42.060]  this is a devilish attribute that we're seeing this is tyranny why do we just
[49:42.060 --> 49:46.620]  accept when government lies about Rand Paul and says that he was irate and
[49:46.620 --> 49:51.840]  wasn't detained both lies why do we not get upset about that why do we trust
[49:51.840 --> 49:56.000]  people that act like this the truth is more and more Americans are awake
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.280]  Congress has a nine percent approval rating the system knows we're waking up
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.120]  to him so now they're taking the velvet glove off the iron fist and just going
[50:03.120 --> 50:08.640]  with the iron fist it is time to reawaken the spirit of 1776 it is time
[50:08.640 --> 50:13.480]  to recognize it as criminal when the TSA violates the 10th and 9th amendment
[50:13.480 --> 50:18.000]  operates in our states but it's even more criminal when they grow up our
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.560]  children our wives and our husbands and harass our old people and make cancer
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.120]  patients get out of wheelchairs that can't walk and make passengers help get
[50:26.120 --> 50:30.400]  them out of their chair this is assault and it's criminal it's sexual and
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.160]  physical assault but it's also criminal when we put up with it we become
[50:35.160 --> 50:41.400]  cowardly accomplices to these scum the TSA takeover of America has unified the
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.560]  people and so have a lot of other issues and the system knows that their attempt

[54:24.600 --> 54:27.920]  get ready I told him I said Aaron we shot the video we've done the research
[54:27.920 --> 54:32.760]  the last two days about their lies I said just take your time getting it done
[54:32.760 --> 54:38.320]  and of course he was leaving this morning as I got here so he'd been up
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.360]  working for more than 24 hours to put that together and I'm giving it a name
[54:42.360 --> 54:46.520]  right now I've got to decide here during the next break I couldn't in three
[54:46.520 --> 54:51.480]  minute break I couldn't I couldn't come to I mean what do we say that's accurate
[54:51.480 --> 54:55.880]  about the video and gets people to watch it you know secrets of the TSA exposed
[54:55.880 --> 55:07.560]  what the TSA doesn't want you to know you know the the T the TSA are world
[55:07.560 --> 55:11.640]  champion liars I don't know what you call it
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.560]  by the way last time we were up in Maine interviewing Charlotte is would be a
[55:17.560 --> 55:24.520]  year ago for her skull and bones expose it's on prison planet TV she gave me
[55:24.520 --> 55:28.600]  this and I've always meant to show it to people this is cool if I had like a man
[55:28.600 --> 55:33.520]  cave at home which I don't I mean I had my little office but everything's
[55:33.520 --> 55:42.920]  overrun by my children my office is in my bedroom I have a little desk but you
[55:42.920 --> 55:46.600]  know the whole house is decorated by my wife and it's great it's nice as you can
[55:46.600 --> 55:53.320]  do it's a it's a chick pad I don't think that this would fit in very nicely maybe
[55:53.320 --> 55:56.920]  I'm just gonna like in one area of the bedroom just start like putting moose
[55:56.920 --> 56:06.760]  heads and Ron Paul license plates you're a radio listener I have a Ron Paul main

[56:22.160 --> 56:26.840]  cones and I like the woods makes you want to go hunting they're fishing of
[56:26.840 --> 56:30.320]  course to get up there I'd probably have to have a bunch of pot-bellied perverts
[56:30.320 --> 56:33.620]  grab my genitals and put me in a microwave oven and then act like I'm the
[56:33.620 --> 56:38.360]  crazy person for not liking it they might rob my bags yeah I did have TSA
[56:38.360 --> 56:46.400]  robbed my bags flying back from New York what in 2005 one of my daughters was
[56:46.400 --> 56:53.120]  newborn but a couple months old and I thought we don't have a plastic rattle
[56:53.120 --> 56:57.480]  I'll go to Tiffany's they were like 50 60 70 bucks apiece I'll get her a rattle
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.720]  and some teething rings and stuff and they only stole one of the one of the
[57:00.720 --> 57:06.120]  things I bought they they unwrapped the little boxes from Tiffany's and then
[57:06.120 --> 57:11.960]  they just so I guess stole what they wanted and even put the note in there
[57:11.960 --> 57:16.400]  that they'd been in there but I'm supposed to like being robbed by the
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.160]  government I mean they do it anyways you know I can't tell you how crazy it is
[57:21.160 --> 57:24.840]  that I've talked to people and seen confirmed cases where they harass small
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.440]  businesses and companies even when you pay them what you're supposed to pay the
[57:28.440 --> 57:33.680]  IRS it's all nebulous so they can rob you and they'll call people in what's
[57:33.680 --> 57:36.840]  happened to my dad when I was a teenager called him in and he said I've given you
[57:36.840 --> 57:39.680]  all the receipts all the facts you want all these penalties interest I don't
[57:39.680 --> 57:45.520]  know I don't owe this and they said mr. Jones we're white-collar criminals

[59:48.720 --> 01:00:00.480]  you waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:20.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.520]  Alex Jones
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:38.440]  okay this is going to be the first of a lot of interviews with an incredible
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:45.040]  researcher and of course a political prisoner he was 100% set up in just a
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.640]  cartoonist fashion many years after quote the crimes were committed of
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.840]  robbing banks a guy who's a West Point grad no criminal record previous to that
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.840]  sent to prison and I know why they did it because when I first read bloodlines
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.840]  the Illuminati ten years ago when I first read some of his books I was
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.880]  still in a learning process and we all are continually I was like you know what
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.440]  a lot of this can't be true now I knew a lot of it was true cuz I'd separately
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.840]  already researched it but some of it was just so outlandish and then over the
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.440]  years separately in my own research from even mainline sources I found other
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.800]  pieces that that was true I mean now it's even in major British newspapers
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:32.000]  that the Royals still have their hind ends wiped that they eat body parts that
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.840]  they're related to vlad the impaler they're really Transylvanian royalty not
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.160]  even German royalty and his book bloodlines the Illuminati of many books
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.760]  he's written is just so important and he's been out of jail now for about a
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.880]  year and is able to speak now and today I didn't even tell him really what I
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.720]  want him on about he's on but I'm sure getting him on every few weeks I want to
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.080]  get into the mindset of the highest level Illuminati and how their power
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.440]  structure is set up and some of the main families probably should have actually
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.400]  brought this up to him before he came on with us and then I would have about 30
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.560]  minutes and then I want to open the phones up for Fritz spring Meyer today
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.520]  joining us via video Skype from his home in Portland Oregon but the book blood
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.280]  lines Illuminati you know we didn't have on the shopping cart for about a month
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.120]  because we sold out of it and because there it was on print demand we always
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.440]  had trouble getting enough of them I just went ahead and belly up to the bar
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.000]  and help Fritz print a couple thousand of these they're available right now at
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.480]  infowars.com we are the warehouser not as distributor we're just the
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.440]  warehouser of the books and we have them whether you want them for wholesale or
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.200]  whether you want to buy them individually and he is mailing us some
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.560]  some shined stickers we're going to put some of the bus those will be available
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:51.040]  next week but bloodlines of the Illuminati available at infowars.com
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.520]  right now Fritz we're about to go to break and we're going to come back and
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.160]  recap all this but good to have you with us how are you enjoying 2012 oh doing
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:08.280]  great thank you yeah I'm doing fine what do you think about that that request on
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.840]  breaking down really crystallizing the mindset the worldview the ultimate goal
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:19.520]  and who some of these top families are in the bloodlines sure we can do that
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:25.080]  when we come back from break yeah I apologize yeah we're about to go to
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.880]  break and of course I know you've always got this info pretty much at your
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.600]  fingertips it's just that I probably should have relayed that to you earlier
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.840]  and and then you can recommend next time you come on what subjects you want to
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.640]  get into because I know you've written books on so many subjects how many books
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:50.080]  have you written well 19 in all and how many of them are in print right now very
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:56.720]  few thanks to your assistance we're able to make the bloodlines available and
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.200]  then there's about a half a dozen others that are available to people you know
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.320]  there's something in this book particularly that really made them angry
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:13.080]  at you take your pick there's there's plenty to for for them to get upset
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:21.640]  about and and we'll discuss some of that yeah well I'll be glad to talk about
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:27.440]  their mindset people naturally assume that someone who's controlling the world
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.520]  thinks like they do but these people do not think like you or I they have a
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:39.560]  totally different mindset and and they view us like you would an ant you know
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.920]  if you stepped on an ant as you're walking on the sidewalk you wouldn't
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.840]  even be concerned about it and and of course they say that about us how much
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.680]  they hate us how we're scum how we're filled they publish little hate letters
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.880]  to humanity and the general public responds by fawning after them we'll be
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.640]  right back with our guest Fritz spring-marsh stay with us Fritz
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:06.200]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.800]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.480]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home tremendous
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.520]  influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.880]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.800]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.160]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.960]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.880]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.520]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:54.520]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars calm or
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:01.240]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV hi this is
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.160]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds

[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  prisoner is gonna be with us then Dr. Stan Monteith and Bob Chapman together
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.240]  Dr. Stan Monteith says he has some breaking news concerning Iran it must be
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.280]  important because I invite him on the show all the time but he rarely reaches
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.600]  out to us to come on and we just got Fritz Springmeier on I've talked about
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.500]  the fact that I've gone over his case last time he was on no criminal record
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:57.360]  up to that point years after some banks get robbed he gets set up by known
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.560]  informants and sent to jail for bank robbery and of course he's pointed out
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.400]  it's a complete fraud this is a guy who was speaking to packed halls that I saw
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.720]  on videos of thousands of people 19 books in print and right before they set
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.480]  him up I remember the year before he said yeah the cops broke in my house
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.640]  looking for marijuana grow labs of course nothing was found yeah you know
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.720]  the local news was reporting that during the raid they found extremist material
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.200]  gotta love that where they break in your house then talk about what's on your
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.400]  bookshelf as if you agree with everything on your bookshelf that you're
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.880]  reading man I've read Mein Kampf doesn't mean I agree with Hitler I wanted to
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  read what he said I've read a book by Julius Caesar too I'm not a I'm not a
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.920]  you know patrician class you know supporter of the Roman city-state I mean
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.280]  it's so ridiculous I've read Nietzsche doesn't mean I support all the ideas of
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.840]  Nietzsche I do think that which does not kill you only makes you stronger and
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.480]  stranger to kind of paraphrase Nietzsche and the Joker but then he was correcting
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.240]  me during the break just a side issue we actually have some of those photos you
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.560]  know he went to West Point but then got out of it not a graduate of West Point
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.940]  because of what he saw as some of the mind control there he also I remember
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.440]  correctly even live with the Amish for a while to study that and it has had some
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.880]  amazing travels and things he saw I think it's best to start out a lot of
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:28.000]  people know who you are we're on XM we've gotten dozens of new affiliates
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.720]  more than a dozen just in the last few weeks I need to mention some of those
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.280]  today so it's probably important for you to introduce yourself to folks so they
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.160]  know who you are and then let's get into in this interview to what I mentioned in
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.580]  the first little short segment what is the mindset of the Illuminati what is
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.680]  their goal what is what are some of the top families and where are they taking
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.920]  our planet but Fritz and then and then while you're mentioning the West Point
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.840]  thing is I guess you sent this to my producers I wasn't aware of it photos of
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:01.000]  you at West Point doing military training is some important point you
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  want to make in general so we'll we'll we'll raise those photos for prison
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.840]  planet TV viewers and radio listeners whenever you're ready so Fritz you've
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:15.000]  got the floor go ahead well people can go to my blog and read
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.640]  some about me that's one way of getting a little introduction another little
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:26.320]  introduction right here at the time is I'm a follower of Christ and that's
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:33.280]  what's important in my life it's not about me it's about Christ and yeah I
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:39.480]  have had a very unusual life where I was exposed to a lot of different things
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:46.680]  living overseas traveling overseas had a father who wanted to save the world by
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.520]  going to third world countries and developing their agriculture and like
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.200]  you said I went to West Point and and as you were saying there I was concerned
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.040]  about the things that I was seeing when I was in the military and I didn't feel
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:11.080]  comfortable being in the military with with the mindset that I saw around me so
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:17.960]  I resigned and some people thought it was a reaction to having been in the
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:23.520]  military that I turned around and joined the Amish but it wasn't it wasn't that
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:29.920]  it was that I was looking for something that was outside of the system and it's
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:36.800]  hard to find anything that's that wants to live a good life good clean life and
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.920]  that's not involved with the system and so I was outside of the system for a
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.080]  little while while I was on mission then I felt called by God to come back and
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:54.000]  warn people about what was going on and so that's what I've been doing these
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.720]  these last few decades is is warning people just like yourself except the
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.760]  last decade was spent mostly in a POW camp while you were out here continuing
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.280]  the good fight so that explains a little bit about myself um but again like I
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.440]  say it's it's not about me it's about Christ and and then the truth of what
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.920]  I'm saying you know one of the things that they try to do to shut me up is they
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:35.800]  try to tarnish the reputation of the messenger and as you know you've been
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.280]  out there you know how how people come out of the woodwork to say all kinds of
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.840]  crazy things about you it's not about me look at the truth of what I'm saying
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.560]  look at the documentation look research these things for yourself people and
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.560]  you'll start seeing it all makes sense and you'll start you'll you'll start
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.280]  putting the pieces together for yourself I'm not asking you to take my word for
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.200]  it that's what I was saying earlier is that when I first read some of your
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.100]  books more than a decade ago a lot of it I could confirm because I've done
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:14.640]  separate research but some of it sounded so far out but over time I would
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.960]  separately even in establishment publications find large pieces that that
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.400]  added to it and now as my understanding's gotten deeper that's how the
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.480]  globalists see it we're asleep they're awake they are programming the
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.880]  subconscious and they're trying to create a totally fake false reality so
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.480]  they can deceive people and and that's what you were talking about decades ago
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.480]  so so so let's get into it crystallizing it for new listeners what is the
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.240]  Illuminati who are they who do they serve what do they want what makes them
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:53.760]  tick and then let's go over some of the families okay um some people kind of
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.520]  cringe when they hear that word Illuminati like like this is a word that
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.280]  they really don't you know some conspiracy nut is using or something
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.900]  this is their own terminology when I started trying to help people that were
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:13.720]  trying to escape from the Illuminati members that had been team together that
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.560]  was their term for it that's the term that they normally use now in in rituals
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.540]  they may use terms like the family or the circle you know don't break the
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:29.080]  circle they may use other words but the term Illuminati is the word that they
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.940]  use themselves and and its meaning is that they believe that they have been
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:42.280]  illumined to godhood that they are gods and of course we're the little peons
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:49.680]  they're the Pharaohs and we're the serfs and that's their mentality they're in a
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:57.400]  class above us we're more or less subhuman and their mentality a lot of
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:07.760]  what goes on is a consequence of that view right there um and and and they've
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.000]  had that view for for many thousands of years this isn't something that's just
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.280]  come about overnight they have a plan they and this plan is an agenda and
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:26.160]  we've been in a great transition in recent years to to bring the entire
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:33.160]  world under the control of the Beast computer which is linked to the internet
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.840]  so you'll notice that there's been an increasing by the way they really call
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.000]  it over in Europe they really call that particular computer system the worldwide
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.760]  beast and and it's a standardized global system in fact from Davos yesterday
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.760]  Homeland Security put out a press release and talks about the global
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.680]  centralized computer database to buy and sell that was in a press release
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:04.360]  yesterday sorry exactly so this this one world mind we're all becoming pulled
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:12.040]  into it the the computers that we have the the PC's that the big ones that are
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.280]  on our desk those are going to be obsolete in a few years we're going to
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.680]  have these handheld devices in our hands that won't even need memory because
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.680]  storing memory is going to be redundant you're going to have these broadband
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:33.760]  such good broadband devices that you can tap into the world mind instantly but
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.320]  the globalist can then also erase whatever they want instantly and that
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.840]  brings total control exactly so we're all being sucked into this one world
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:48.280]  mind one global government where we're all going to be like little adjuncts
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.600]  little fingers of of this beast and little cells of this beast we're just
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:00.240]  going to be as they used to say cogs in a machine you know and it's becoming
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:08.080]  increasingly that way but a lot of us are considered worthless eaters and so
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.280]  there's been a number of written agendas you know Henry Kissinger had one but
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.600]  there's many others where they have outlined on paper and sometimes publicly
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.040]  came out with these things where they want to get rid of a large share of us
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:32.520]  genocide so death is at the heart of their agenda boy that's true and you can
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.600]  look at it from several different directions you can say well these people
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.680]  the evil that they're doing would require them to to justify their actions
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.760]  by being Satanist or you could look at it the other way and say because they're
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.760]  Satanist they're they have these agendas but either way you want to look at it
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:57.180]  they're nasty philosophy that that is yeah they don't see themselves as
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:02.960]  Satanist they they think Lucifer's God I think it's very beautiful yes they they
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:10.600]  have a lot of high-level rituals and very sophisticated rituals rituals that
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.520]  go back to antiquity they still carry out some of the same rituals that were
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:25.800]  done in ancient Egypt by the Pharaohs rituals that go back to ancient Babylon
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:32.080]  the names that they give themselves their ritual names and everything go
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.480]  back to the ancient gods the ancient mystery religion intriguing intriguing

[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:56.760]  he's back with us okay Fritz continuing in this short segment with the mindset
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:02.240]  you were getting into their rituals going back to Babylon back to Egypt okay
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:08.680]  great I'm gonna take this kind of in a direction that's going to answer several
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:15.520]  of the questions that you had we had a scandal that took place in Belgium the
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:22.240]  Dutro affair and and the the Europeans discovered that the Belgium government
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.240]  was involved in satanic rituals and pedophilia this is this all involves the
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:35.160]  mindset of the elite and the there was a humongous scandal about a hundred and
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:40.840]  ten people were assassinated to keep a lid on it now here in the United States
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:46.440]  we had the Kennedy assassination we had 9-eleven those are entry points for
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:52.880]  people to learn that something's wrong but even closer to the heart of things
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:26:00.400]  was this Dutro affair where where they were where they actually discovered the
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.600]  satanic connection to all of this because a lot of people realize you know
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:10.360]  Wall Street has a lot of power these people the big mucky mucks they go to
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:15.120]  places like the Bohemian Grove but like when you were in the Bohemian Grove you
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.880]  notice that there's something else going on here you know it's not like these
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.760]  people are just atheists that don't don't have a religious side to them when
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.760]  you saw a cremation of care you're beginning to get a window that there's
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:36.120]  something more to these people right so the scandal exposed the satanic side of
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:42.840]  this and how the governments in in Europe were protecting this huge network
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:49.920]  of child slavery and child prostitution they would have pink ballets in this
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.200]  castle that I exposed and so the book that you've been been presenting to
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.760]  people bloodlines of Illuminati that came out in 95 it was the first place
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:08.080]  where the public got a real good look at that mother of darkness castle that's
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.520]  like a headquarters for the the female branch of the Illuminati that's where
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:20.040]  the grand dames like Bill Clinton's lower than Hillary Clinton in the
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:25.320]  Illuminati Hillary Clinton becoming a grand dame that means that she would
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:34.480]  travel to this castle and do rituals and the castle was also used for murdering
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:42.440]  children in and they have rituals there and by the way this is the reason they
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.640]  came after you so much and separately it's now come out in the news that
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.520]  Hillary does weird rituals same thing with Tony Blair Francois Mitterrand
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:58.040]  admitted does worship Lucifer had that pyramid at the Louvre built with 666
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.360]  pieces of pink glass Tony Blair reportedly this is mainstream British
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.080]  news flops around and is possessed by the spirit of light every morning
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.720]  flopping around and goes to sacred sites worldwide I mean these are complete
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:21.000]  lunatics yes this is the hidden side of it all we see the nice good front where
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.680]  the press shows these people as in their their suits and ties and looking
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:32.320]  intelligent and lies but then there's this ritual side this hidden ritual side
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.680]  of them and like if you're someone like Hillary and you're going to this the
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.560]  Chateau de Omaroy and I don't speak French so I probably butchered the name
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.280]  there but it's a castle that I exposed I found out about the castle 1991 when I
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.480]  was working with people that were trying to get out of the Illuminati these were
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.680]  were people that had done rituals in the castle and knew about it by the way let
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.000]  me stop again I didn't believe your book when I first read it and then the Sunday
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.840]  Times of London came out with a separate castle in Burgundy where all these women
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.520]  escaped and the cops got there and there were a bunch of dead women and women in
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.840]  cages and it turned out it went to the top leaders of France so the whole thing
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.840]  got shut down but this actually came out in the news after I read your book years
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:25.520]  later I saw the same stuff exactly folks and I'm like Oh Fritz
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.320]  spring-meyer this goes too far and then and then I see it in the news it's just
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.800]  god help us stay right there Fritz spring-meyer is our guest and I got
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.960]  those congressional hearings where they're asking Rumsfeld well Dine Corps
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.400]  runs these child kidnapping rings are you gonna do anything about that he goes
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.760]  no they were given a one-year penalty on these contracts in that area of Europe
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.640]  well no one goes to jail and he goes no I mean folks oh man I tell you we're on

[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:06.000]  thirty one eight hundred two five nine nine two thirty one okay going back to
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.760]  the author of bloodlines of the Illuminati an incredible book and it's
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.840]  Dallas phone book size full of documents and photos you're not gonna be able to
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.880]  put this book down Fritz continuing from that point you've gotten to that being
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.720]  in the European press the satanic rituals the police the judges the the
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:28.200]  report of the royal family they're always finding dead bodies they just
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:32.160]  found a new dead teenager on Queen Elizabeth's property right by our house
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:42.000]  the other day it's just a routine thing but please continue yes um earlier you
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.820]  ask about some of the names of their gods within the women's branch we were
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:56.200]  talking about the mother of darkness castle there near Munro Belgium and the
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.820]  kind of rituals that will go on there there will be hierarchy rituals these
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:08.920]  are high-level rituals and these Illuminati members are programmed
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.040]  multiples they're multiple personalities so they have personalities that take
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:19.920]  part in the rituals one like for the women there's a triad goddess system
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:26.000]  where it's mother where it's maiden mother and crone and a lot of these
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.080]  things actually are around us and we don't even realize it like one of the
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:37.360]  crone figures Calick another one of her names is Caledonia another crone that's
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:43.000]  related to Calick is Cali and California California is the sea hag
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.840]  California's the sea hag it's all about gods and goddesses and just like Eulogia
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:53.400]  at Skull and Bones it's admitted they worship Eulogia there which is a hag but
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.520]  I mean let's continue to break this down it's just incredible you're saying this
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:03.600]  it sounds wild but it's all right there if you've done the research yes and it's
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:10.520]  once you start realizing that there's this whole substrata around us that of
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.920]  this occult world there's a cult symbology all around us and they're not
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:21.240]  just programming us animal psychology Pavlovian psychology this isn't new it's
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:26.960]  just a modern packaging they themselves come from a programming cult that's what
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.720]  these rituals are ancients learned mind control that's why every ancient society
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:36.800]  tortured had human sacrifice made the king sometimes kill his own kids it's
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.560]  all about the priest class totally dominating continue with the women and
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.560]  then the men but who's at the head of it continue well within the women's branch
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:55.840]  the they have grand dame and that's a that's the final level yeah you have
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:01.040]  these families and there's five inner families and then there's 13 top
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:11.360]  families and then in the next ring you have like 500 inner families and it's
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.620]  like peeling back at onion there's you know you've got the inner core that
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:21.400]  works through the next level next level next level and so you have all of these
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:29.840]  rituals all these committees councils of 13 is a Sanhedrin of 70 you've got so
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.520]  many different organizations and one thing notice the super Congress is 12
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.720]  members of the Congress and the president the 13th again always
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:49.040]  counterfeiting Christ yeah they enjoy that number 13 for these councils so
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:54.600]  let's say we're good genuine you were getting into the different you were
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:01.720]  talking about the Sanhedrin yeah I was I was discussing how there's there's a
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:11.520]  not one person is running the show like we would we would think because what
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.360]  happens is is you're born into this and you're as as somebody who's been born in
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.600]  even if you rise to the top and even if you have a lot of power you're still
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:28.880]  signing on to the plan the plan was created you know it's it's a group thing
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:35.160]  it's it's and and it's something that's been going on for a long time so they
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:41.400]  have long-range plans so these agendas aren't just snap decisions the the idea
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:47.040]  that they were there would be a third World War has been around for for over
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.440]  200 all the top Masons and Illuminati people like Weishaupt wrote books about
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:58.440]  it as you know in 1770s they even described the three wars yeah yeah so
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:06.880]  we're so so these things are our 10-year plans 30-year plans 50-year plans 100
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.600]  year but they have these long-range plans and then they have these systems
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:17.840]  to bring them about going back to how the control filters down they have
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:30.760]  divided a life into six major areas um they take what God uses to sustain the
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.960]  world truth love and and things like this and there's a twisting of those
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.560]  things and they make a system out of it so therefore you end up with the
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.000]  healthcare system the political system the financial system like Wall Street
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.560]  the banking system you have a system of control and so to get these necessities
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:40:02.640]  of life that we we feel we need we end up linking ourselves to these powerful
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.320]  controlling system it's about overthrowing creation becoming God
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:10.760]  taking things over so we have to go to them as if they're God and we're born
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:16.880]  into a giant lie not just mind control but a physical lie that's how they
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.560]  try to take free will away exactly you said it better than I did no I didn't
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:29.280]  know you're absolutely right but continue on this line well said that's
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:35.160]  that's exactly and so from the time we're born we're born into this system
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:41.280]  and it systematically controls us and steals our freedom and all the while
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:46.720]  telling us oh you're free you're this or that you're making the decisions you
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.440]  know yeah like like the American people how often have I heard heard people say
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.280]  well you shouldn't you shouldn't complain about your president because we
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:02.360]  were the ones that elected him no no no people you didn't elect that president
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.920]  they select who you can then pick from and then even that's a fraud that's why
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.480]  Ron Paul is kind of showing that it's all theater because he is one of the
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.680]  only real people to come along in a very long time and we see the system together
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:21.640]  acting as one to ignore him to lie about him to spin and I think this is really
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:27.600]  revealed to people just how lockstep the corporate whore media is but in that as
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:33.120]  why is the system losing a lot of power right now Fritz from my research their
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:39.120]  system is not right as they get close to getting everything they've wanted right
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:42.840]  here at the end right at the jump point where they're supposed to go from
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.480]  incremental to fast things are not going well things are getting out of control
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:52.800]  for them do you agree with that assessment yeah there has been some
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:59.680]  rubber band effect is is the term we used to use that is people in power when
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.720]  they give a command there's a big rubber band effect of when it gets what the
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:09.200]  command gets stretched to something else by the time it reaches the the bottom
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:15.840]  tier yeah things have gotten sloppy form but they're they're working on tightening
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.440]  things up so in the next few years they'll they're going to implement some
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.400]  plans to tighten things up and we see that they're coming out saying we'll
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.040]  secretly arrest you we're shutting down free speech and you bet we're putting
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.720]  stuff in your shots and we're gonna force you to take them yeah so there
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:41.120]  will be a whole range of things and one thing that they're concerned about
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:47.600]  especially with Americans is Americans have too much freedom too much money too
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:53.760]  much mobility and so you're going to see United States humble and I'm gonna stop
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.680]  you again Jim Tucker who has been proven to have sources in Bilderberg I've got
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.880]  some sub sources that have sources in Bilderberg all they talk about is how
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:05.560]  we've got too much money and how they're gonna make us financially bankrupt and
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:09.720]  how much they hate Liberty Movement and Ron Paul and myself and others I've been
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:14.800]  brought up I mean they really cannot stand it and they want to use
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.000]  impoverishment as a tool of control and a post-industrial fake environmental
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.440]  movement but even that's in trouble but people need to understand I mean they
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.080]  they what you're saying Fritz is so accurate but but you're saying it from
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:30.600]  inside sources that you got instead of just learning it I mean I know you did
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.760]  as well separately out there just kind of you know from the bottom up you
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.360]  happen to bump right into people that had actually been in it and I think
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:44.200]  that's why they got so scared of you and came after you yeah I'm sure there are
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:52.240]  multiple reasons as to why I I ticked people off so it's hard to put your
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.240]  finger on just one reason but yeah you kind of lumped it up lumped it together
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:11.040]  there exactly and two things that the insiders talked to me about that opened
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:17.480]  my eyes up a lot that we've discussed today was is bloodlines are important to
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:23.560]  these people they keep track of their genealogies fastidiously and also
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:31.400]  control mind control the mind control is extremely important to them and and so
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:37.280]  that's why I wrote several books on the mind control and it's why I wrote the
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:45.640]  bloodlines book it's not a casual topic with film it's very important and you'll
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:52.560]  notice like the Rothschilds which is one of the inner five families back in 1826
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:57.480]  I believe it was it became there was a newspaper article that came out how the
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:02.200]  family had organized a meeting of all the heads of the family and taken a
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:07.800]  stand in the family meeting that they would only marry within the family well
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:14.320]  that's that's rather common within the Illuminati is they they try to marry
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:23.080]  within their bloodline and right there is a scientific reason why royalty
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:27.400]  elites are always so macabre and psychopathic every mammal species that
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:33.480]  interbreeds becomes insane vicious psychopathic unstable unsocial so right
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.520]  there even if somebody isn't into spiritualism or Christian or whatever
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:49.000]  scientifically these are inbred crazy people so and and they're doing it
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:59.040]  intentionally they have brought in some outside blood but but basically
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.240]  generally they're they're pretty the bloodlines are pretty pure as far as
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.720]  being Illuminati blood and there's some reasons for that too they pass on
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:18.040]  generational curses they pass on okay are we losing connection here no no I
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:23.920]  can hear you can you hear me okay fine it started breaking up a little bit but
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:30.920]  keep going you're saying they pass on curses yeah they for the mind control
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:36.840]  they need people that are genetically able to dissociate and become program
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.960]  multiple personalities and most people are not able to do that if you torture
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:49.080]  most little children they'll just curl up and die it takes a special select
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.880]  breed of people that that as children when they're tortured are creative
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:47:00.800]  enough to become multiple personalities not everybody is able to do that and
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:07.960]  but their bloodlines have good disassociative abilities and this is
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:15.600]  something that they developed over thousands of years so yeah they they're
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.680]  they're not like us and that's one of the things I might emphasize to the
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:27.240]  listeners because so oftentimes I hear people trying to extrapolate what these
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:34.440]  leaders must be thinking and they place their own thinking upon them it doesn't
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.160]  work that way it's just like trying to figure out how a bureaucrat is going to
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:46.000]  make a decision they don't think like a rational logical person they have their
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.680]  own bureaucratic logic which doesn't make any sense to any rational person
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.400]  you know well it's usually about the raw exercise of power
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:08.080]  yeah but when you think through what you would say well what they want to
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:12.120]  accomplish is this this and this why would they do that and it would seem
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:18.040]  like it would be counterproductive there's a lot of a lot of subplots
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:25.080]  within subplots within subplots and they create conflict because the way they
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:30.080]  like to work is through controlled conflict so just because maybe one
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.560]  Illuminati family is trying to take care of another Illuminati family like you
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:40.920]  see Onassis was working against the Kennedys you know that the Kennedy the
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:45.160]  Kennedy brothers and Onassis hated each other but that doesn't mean that they're
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.080]  not on the same team it means that's the way the Illuminati work they like to
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:54.480]  stab each other in the backs thinking that that's the way you get the best the
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:59.120]  the best person is going to rise to the top through all this yeah they see it as
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:03.400]  social Darwinism it's just incredible the book break breaks down so much of it
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:08.560]  bloodlines Illuminati Fred spring Meyer Fritz right now let's look at our books
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.160]  because we're gonna come back and do one segment then one more segment for you
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.160]  got to leave us I want to get you back up next week for a full hour or maybe
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:21.200]  even two to really get into all this you can send us some slides if you want for
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.320]  people that are watching on the internet not just listening on the radio as we
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.720]  can actually show some of what you're talking about here on air and kind of go
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.360]  through this in more detail because this is riveting and I don't want to go to
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.680]  break I don't even want to come back and take calls but they'll bring up great
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:39.000]  points I want to keep hearing you bring up more because as crazy as this all
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.720]  sounds truth is stranger than fiction every time you're talking about
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.240]  something there because I've done so much research on my own it's like bing
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.300]  bing bing bing bing bing bing all this proof that what you're saying is so
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:53.700]  incredibly accurate and that's why they've come after you because you're
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:58.920]  hitting the nail on the head these people are basically a ruling elite of
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:04.560]  mentally ill crazy people who are who are who are so anti-human that they're
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.800]  able to take over because they're like cancer they're malfunctioning and they're
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:15.480]  the inmates are running the asylum and they're highly intelligent genius level
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:23.120]  psychopathic control freak sadist who who are just not what regular people are
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:30.800]  they are the dark side yeah well said well my friend I tell you I just hope

[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:28.320]  weren't into the occult it's bizarre but if you've done your research or you're a
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.320]  news hound it just keeps popping up and the Illuminati is real these people are
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.480]  into it I've got letters that George Washington wrote talking about the
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:43.020]  Illuminati trying to take over the Masons this stuff is going on and the
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:46.240]  book bloodlines the Illuminati exposes that we're working on getting Fritz on
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:51.680]  both the nightly news next week and we think Thursday tentative for two hours
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.200]  noon to two so we can have him talk for an hour I'll just shove a sock in my
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.000]  mouth and then an hour of phone calls but let's go to calls right now for the
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.480]  next little segment try to get all five of these callers Carl Ronnie Tommy
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:09.360]  Christian Gary Gary's in Hong Kong so we'll go to Gary in Hong Kong first Gary
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:16.320]  your question for Fritz spring Meyer hello yes sir oh I'm a first-time caller
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:21.640]  of a longtime listener I've been a Mason for 30 years and I stopped paying my
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:27.120]  dues because I have Cherokees in my family and a tribal Lakota elder sent
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.080]  me a video from Mount Pleasant boarding school and you know there's murder and
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:35.440]  torture they went on to those boarding schools and what happened was the
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.880]  cornerstone I saw in the video the cornerstone was laid by Freemasons and
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:43.160]  that sort of did it for me right there well I mean overall most Freemasons are
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.240]  compartmentalized like every other big organization and think they're doing
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:49.760]  good I've had a lot of ancestors that were Masons a lot of the founders were
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:55.560]  but the system uses that in a secret society they will grow within it
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.200]  basically because if you go back it goes back to Solomon's temple and before so
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:05.800]  it goes back into antiquity and you've had these you know these mystery schools
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.400]  that go right back to Egypt not just Babylon but do you have a question for
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:14.480]  Fritz spring mark no I just wanted to make a comment and give you and Mark
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.000]  Dyson prison apology because I was in denial for a long time and I didn't
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.680]  believe it first but now I'm so sorry you know well that's like saying you
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.240]  know the government deals the drugs and people say well are you saying a cop on
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.240]  the beach stealing drugs no not on average it's at the top they certainly
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:34.960]  are but but but god bless you and I appreciate your call briefly I mean how
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:40.980]  does modern masonry especially tie into all this Fritz well I like to call it
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.880]  the glove that fits on to the hand of the Illuminati you said it very well
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.320]  they're used and a lot of people are unwittingly used they don't see the
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.240]  bigger picture for some reason they just they just blindly go along and think
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:00.480]  they're in a good old boys club there's clues all around them as to what's going
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:07.240]  on but like so many people they they're not really analyzing what they're doing
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:13.000]  or what they're involved with so you said you said it pretty well is that
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.440]  you know you have a mixture some people are have their eyes open and realize
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:24.520]  what's what the bigger picture is and some people just participate and just
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:30.000]  blindly continue to support something that's working for for the elite yeah
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.560]  let's jam in another call here I see a call on the board called Antichrist but
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:38.320]  we got to go in order here Carl in Oregon you're on the air welcome good
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.800]  afternoon cover commander miss talking to you on Sunday

[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:19.880]  them and let's see what the other one was about a bit the best truth movement
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.520]  that's not been co-opted to get into okay so so basically globalists want to
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:28.200]  turn us into these biological androids they're announcing all these microchips
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.400]  to cure all these things but what is the Trojan horse that's in them so we'll get

[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:58.120]  recommending anything I mean you've got a tremendous program here for people to
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:07.720]  watch and you're you know it's all about them becoming empowered I mean I'm not
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:11.840]  saying organizations are bad but that's where things always get weird it's just
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:15.080]  I mean I'm I don't even have an organization it's just we're
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:24.360]  independent we love freedom exactly I've seen some groups that are actually
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.760]  managing to get the right idea where they don't want anybody to be the leader
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:34.320]  where they want to empower everybody that was sort of the idea behind that
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.680]  Occupy Wall Street movement but then I heard a lot of people complaining well
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:42.760]  there's not one spokesman want one leader well that's the mindset that
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:48.160]  people have is that is they want things to be controlled they don't you know but
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:55.600]  we need to empower people not control them as far as the Android thing we see
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:01.080]  this progression first it started out a number of years ago with people being
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:06.040]  implanted and then these implants and a few of the people that I work with
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:11.800]  actually managed to get the implants or get them out of them but these implants
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:17.400]  were were being controlled by AI artificial intelligence generally
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.760]  although sometimes they would be manipulated by human handlers never just
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:27.640]  they were being used for weird things but you have something called BCI brain
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:34.360]  computer interface and we're gonna can we're gonna see a gradual progression of
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:39.200]  more BCI as they integrate I want to raise this they've already got the
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:46.160]  drones that that are autonomous flying around killing people oh yes and we're
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:52.080]  gonna see an increasing progression of this as they link us back in to that
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.880]  internet system that beasts brain they're linking us they're tying us all
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:02.560]  back in there the web is getting stronger and stronger yeah let's go to
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:06.160]  another call here Tommy I intend to see you're on the air with Fritz
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:11.880]  springmar go ahead sir hey Alex how you doing good I gotta help you out with
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:16.560]  this media name I believe I got it the word has its origins in Greek theater
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.400]  describing a character who wore a mask normally describing an unregenerate
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.200]  person who was self-deceived they have received a reward the reward is they
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.600]  were seen by me and nothing more it's hypocrite how about the hip-hop media
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:37.640]  that's a good idea I appreciate your call Fritz what is a good name for the
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:45.040]  prostitute Decepticon sewer stream trader stream media just you know elite
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.520]  brainwashing media globalist media what would you call the mainstream media what
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:57.600]  really describes them boy you have some great language there it's it's all a
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.920]  great show this one grand master in the Illuminati he said it's all just theater
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:09.920]  for the masses it's just a big show that they put on and they but you said it
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:15.640]  very well you know it it's uh and and then they tell us that they print all
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:20.240]  the news that's 50 here well apparently all the news that's fit for them to give
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:24.240]  us that's a very arrogant statement hidden in plain view right there I mean
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:30.880]  really it is the theater the fiction media the the mainstream media is even
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:33.440]  when it's real stuff they're talking about they always put some spin on it
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:37.240]  and I always wonder why they lie even when it's the truth would suit them
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:41.940]  because they they want everything just to be false it's just part of what they
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.040]  do I know we got a bunch of other callers folks you can stay on and talk

[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.840]  today then we'll be back tonight seven o'clock central with info Wars nightly
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:49.080]  news at info Wars news.com and prison planet TV we have a big article
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.360]  investigative report up at info Wars calm that is so important to get out to
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:09:00.600]  everyone you know FEMA camps and rendition hubs discovered
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:06.360]  and it's by Kurt Nemo and it has a video report I compiled with Rob do and what's
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:09.600]  crazy here is there's all these links the admissions of the torture flights
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.500]  out of the US that citizens are being grabbed that the government says they
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:19.280]  can kill citizens not just torture admitting the Rex 84 admitting the FEMA
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.120]  camps admitting all the facets of it but still it's a conspiracy theory to say
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:27.760]  this is going on
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:33.160]  that's like when Rand Paul got it held for almost two hours they just said no
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:37.160]  you weren't held for that and no when we hold you by force you're not detained
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.680]  and you're a conspiracy theorist that I've actually seen that in the news
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:46.040]  they're calling drudge a conspiracy theorist for linking to articles and
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:52.200]  videos of Newt Gingrich admitting he's for open borders and carbon taxes the
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:56.480]  New York Times calls it a conspiracy theory
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:02.320]  they call a conspiratorial dumping of twisted and manipulative negative
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.820]  attacks again if you catch a guy come out of your house with your television
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:09.280]  set you're like you're robbing my house they're like you're a conspiracy
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.560]  theorist I think the average American might go oh yes sir take it take it and
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:17.760]  by the way you know I'm gonna break your nose and you're like you broke my nose
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:21.400]  this conspiracy theory oh I'm not bleeding you're right here's a ball peen
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.440]  hammer in the head yeah yeah no actually kill you then your wife walks up you
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:29.160]  just killed my husband a hammer conspiracy theory it's like a trance
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:34.240]  word the person goes you're right you're right yeah I'm not even doing this show
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:38.680]  it doesn't even exist is a concern that in fact I told carnival I guess that
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:45.280]  owns that sub company that had the ship that wrecked into the rocks there you
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.360]  know they've been acting like they didn't do anything wrong and the
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.420]  captain's been like well I was a couple miles off course for no reason I feel
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:55.360]  like it and you know I'm sure I got in the lifeboat and ordered dinner in the
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.680]  lifeboat and but everything's fine you know I did nothing wrong I just told the
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:03.080]  company just say it's a conspiracy theory just say the Mediterranean
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:08.920]  doesn't exist Italy doesn't exist that eight-story ocean liner doesn't exist I
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:13.960]  don't exist all right I'm starting to be sarcastic here I got a lot of financial
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:17.760]  news Davos the world a leader meeting and saying how do we stop world
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.840]  revolution and their answer is tax the rich but you read the details it's tax
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.160]  the middle class give it to the bankers they still want a hundred plus trillion
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.560]  like they said last year and give chicken feed to the underclass that
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:35.160]  everybody's being forced into basically to make everybody dependent and that's
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.760]  the game plan there and joining us to break that down is Bob Chapman of the
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.840]  International Forecaster with always his great financial breakdowns he did
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:47.640]  point out a long time ago as many of our guests did they would go into qe3 and
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:51.520]  now they announced what the last week oh we're gonna have some qe3 but it's gonna
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.120]  be different the Wall Street Journal said they don't really tell you how but
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:58.480]  gold and silver have of course started their way back up with the world
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:02.680]  announcement that they're firing up the printing presses so Bob what's happening
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:05.800]  right now in the world economy what's the most important things that you've
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:10.420]  seen out of Davos and what's happening with gold and silver right now Bob well
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:16.320]  I think what's significant is that none of the media the major major at all
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:23.480]  talks about the transference of funds from the Federal Reserve to the European
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:30.800]  Central Bank and we're talking about a trillion dollars and were they were to
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:39.920]  use prudent usage of funds like banks normally do and they could jack it up to
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.800]  10 trillion if they wanted to by borrowing borrowing against trillion and
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:51.560]  for those who don't know right now their leverage is 30 to 1 what is 70 a few
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:57.080]  years ago and the show shows you the risk that they take taken and they will
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.520]  probably take into fractional banking so what does that mean it means that money
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:07.920]  is going to be almost endless for the next couple of years flowing from the
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:14.840]  Fed through the European Central Bank the bank's 523 of them all your safe
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:21.640]  $600 billion they're supposed to take that money and buy their own bonds by
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:29.480]  bonds from other lagged countries and spend enough in loans to keep the
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:35.800]  economy from a collapsing the same plan we have here in America right now only
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:41.320]  it's come in a different form not the way it was done with the European
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:47.920]  Central Bank and it looks probably like at least from this viewpoint at this
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:55.320]  moment Greece is probably going to not continue as it has that I think they'll
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:06.840]  default in the u.s. about I think they began their QE 3 in January just a
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:12.040]  couple of weeks ago I expected them to announce it in June maybe it's gonna be
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:18.760]  in March like they're talking about and we're talking about the Federal Reserve
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.560]  going to the banks and buying their garbage those are bonds that are worth
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.360]  very much and other bad loans and things like this how much they're gonna spend
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:36.960]  probably 800 200 800 billion to one point two or three trillion and that
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:43.040]  money will go into the banks and the banks will be able to buy treasuries
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:52.800]  agencies as well as make more loans to keep the the economy based same is going
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:57.880]  to happen in Germany Europe and also in England all right your phone was only
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:00.920]  breaking up just a bit but I don't get how they can have the Wall Street Journal
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:06.360]  and others the last week and a half or so just calmly just say oh yeah the feds
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:09.360]  gonna have some more stimulus but they're gonna keep it under wraps I mean
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:13.880]  it just shows how incredibly secretive they've gotten they've gotten even more
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:25.160]  secretive well it devotes I saw the president of JPM say that he thought
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:31.600]  that most of mr. Bernanke had done the best job ever possible he was just a
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:37.920]  champ and of course this is the same propaganda that you receive all the time
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:46.560]  and Davos is just another Bilderberger meeting for all intents and purposes
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:52.560]  generated toward finance and economics let me ask you this what do you make
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:57.360]  what do you make of Soros coming out and saying the most dangerous time in
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.680]  history we're all in deep trouble I'm not having any investments I'm not
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:07.320]  investing anybody's money this is worse than you know when I was you know in
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:11.520]  World War two yeah we know as a collaborator helping round folks up and
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:15.800]  take their property but I mean he's acting like now he had nothing to do
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:21.000]  with what's happened and and the fact that they're signaling that and the fact
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.160]  that Homeland Security is now announcing all these new political crackdowns and
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:30.240]  this new takeover of local police they want they always signal this stuff right
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:35.480]  before some big event Bob what do you say I think you're right and again I
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.120]  don't know when it's going to come it's been in process will they have it during
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:47.160]  the presidential campaign maybe I just don't know I do know that what you say
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:51.000]  about law enforcement and their relationship with the military is going
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:59.960]  on and any listener this channel knows that I think there's a possibility and
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:07.280]  you know you you don't like to see these things happen but I think generally
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:14.960]  speaking they're going to attempt to keep the stock market going sideways
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:26.480]  somewhere between 12,500 and 10,000 or 13,000 and 10,000 somewhere in that area
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:34.600]  and I've been looking at I've been seeing all the emphasis on keeping the
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:44.400]  market up I think there's a possibility now from what they've had to say that
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:50.320]  perhaps they may take the market down a little deeper than they would have
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:59.600]  otherwise in a present presidential year and I think that's what we get to look
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:05.320]  forward during the year and as a result of all the spending both in Europe in
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:09.840]  the United States gold and server gonna go bonkers there's just no two ways
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:15.200]  about it Bob obviously what's the main driver not just QE three but won't the
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.760]  the fact they're gonna keep interest rates at zero I mean what's bigger the
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:23.520]  QE three and in driving up commodities namely gold and silver but oil as well
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:28.320]  starting to go up I mean is it is it QE three or is it the announcement to keep
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:34.400]  interest rates at zero for the big boys well there's three spot there and I'm
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.160]  gonna give you spot number one that you didn't mention think about having the
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:47.400]  possibility of having ten trillion dollars in Europe that is really where
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:54.040]  all the trouble can come from and then you can follow up with two or three and
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:59.480]  zero interest rates for three years they have no intention of doing anything
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:04.240]  about anything other than what they've been doing and while we're limping along
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:10.480]  they're doing things that you've been talking about with TSA and FEMA
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:18.440]  internment camps and turning our law enforcement into military which is a
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:26.160]  drastic mistake and and so it'll be a combination of things the year is not
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.800]  going to be as bad as people think although the market could get down say
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:36.600]  they're ten thousand five hundred eleven thousand five hundred that's possible
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:41.480]  but otherwise the market will probably save even but gold and silver gonna go
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:48.040]  through the roof I mean that's mega stimulus and is you know total
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:54.160]  monetization and so that that's not gonna stop Wow it's gonna take all right
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:58.880]  stay there Bob let's get into more news calls all coming up and popping in

[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:16.560]  mind I want to take a few calls for you Bob and then dr. Monteith was a great
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:20.440]  guy we love having him on the show he never contacts us though and says hey I
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:25.000]  want to come on I've got some breaking news so it must be important he'll be
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.640]  popping in with us you'll be riding shotgun to give your view on it and
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:33.400]  your participation that is always valued but I wanted to raise this
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:40.960]  point for you Bob bombshell FEMA camps confirmed rendition hubs discovered and
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:44.240]  we have this report about these centers they're building at airports and
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:49.360]  transportation hubs though their own little FEMA camps to then send people
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.800]  off to different areas where they can be tortured or killed or disappeared or
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:57.000]  re-educated and the government now admits they're doing this I mean it's
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.360]  just the total certification that they're dangerous lawless armed and
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:06.480]  dangerous crooks whose stage terror attacks is the pretext to overthrow the
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:13.000]  Republic I mean that's now all a fact no one can deny it but what do you make of
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:18.200]  the roll out here I've got one out of the Miami Herald Florida proposes using
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.880]  ballparks and stadiums as homeless shelters this is what we've always said
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:27.200]  they're gonna roll out the camps at first during the collapse as great
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:31.280]  places thank goodness they were there to take care of you and then there are
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:35.080]  areas where the troublemakers are kept and now that's all confirmed the
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:42.760]  emergency centers act and all of this what's your view on this well I think
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.480]  it's a lead-up and we saw that I think it was in Denver at the football game
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:54.600]  and where they rounded up the kids and and put them in one place and put the
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:00.360]  parents to the other and you had to comply or you didn't get your kids back
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:10.360]  same concept like in Florida lots of people homeless being put on mostly
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.920]  baseball fields as you mentioned next step is we can't have you be there
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:20.520]  anymore but we send you to a camp in Arkansas which is better equipped to
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:27.640]  take care of you one of their internment camps or some such place and I think
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:33.600]  that's the next step and that'll probably come I don't think it's gonna
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:38.960]  come quickly it'll take a while probably a year after somewhere in that time
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.800]  frame well you're right and that's how they introduce it so the police at first
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:47.840]  and all the drills I've been to that I have in films like police day 2000 and
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:52.760]  others they have the role players saying I'm an American don't take my guns but
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:58.240]  let me in the camp the people are fighting to get into the camp so they
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.640]  sell the psychology to the police and military like you're lucky to be getting
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:05.840]  in the camp but then there are troublemakers that also get forcibly
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:11.440]  taken so it's all about selling it just like TV sells torture and secret arrests
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:20.160]  now you're just selling cyanide like it's mother's milk making it at that
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:27.320]  making it logical yeah well Bob do you think people are gonna go along with
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:35.280]  this see I'm afraid I think most of them well see I had just forgot I think you
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:39.880]  gotta understand their state too they're out of jobs they don't have a house they
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:45.600]  don't have any they're living on a baseball field you know how can it get
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:50.440]  any worse government take care of me and you sure
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:54.680]  we'll send you that camp over there the facilities are much better and that to
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:58.440]  go to the camp and that just sets the precedent to build the archipelago of
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:02.760]  camps and have the public roll out for them but you just mentioned Denver I
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:08.160]  forgotten we sent reporters to that citywide drill and discovered they were
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:12.080]  busing the kids to the camp and then we found the Washington Post article from
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:16.040]  years before where it said in emergencies the state's gonna take your
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.880]  kids from you until you turn your guns in Bob that's right out of the Soviet
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:28.240]  Union yeah on when I was on that day well we had all the feedback on the
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:32.760]  station here so that's how I knew about it well I'd forgotten about it you know
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:36.040]  you know you're in trouble when you forget there's so much tyranny you
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.280]  can't even keep track of it all Ronnie in Texas you're on with Bob Chapman go
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:45.000]  ahead but thank you Bob I appreciate the chances
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.480]  after you I'm afraid we might disagree on this one idea and that is mood
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:53.800]  alteration which is all the mankind and selective persecution ie prohibition is
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:58.760]  now the tax-free cash cow organized crime thugs so could that possibly be a
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:05.120]  way to defeat these evil forces you're talking about decriminalizing marijuana
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:11.560]  or drugs I would imagine Bob what would that do to the new world order well take
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:19.640]  a lot of income away from them the numbers are astronomical five billion
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:24.520]  dollars or five hundred billion dollars a year whatever it is yes father build
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:31.680]  they do not want the legalization of any kind of drug other than prescription
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:35.920]  drugs from companies which they control and all the stock in that's right stay
[02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:40.760]  there Bob Dennis wants to talk to you too we've got dr. Monteith popping in as

[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:38.480]  I was just thinking about getting dr. Montif on for an hour you know in the
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:42.240]  near future and but calling up and getting him on he's a talk show host in
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:47.000]  his own right a busy guy but rarely does he contact us with something that he
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.200]  says is breaking from a CFR source and of course he is a retired medical doctor
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:59.560]  somebody fighting the globalist for almost 50 years he's worked in Santa
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:04.040]  Cruz again for decades he led a delegation of physicians from Santa Cruz

[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:11.140]  years he led the fight with an organized medicine in California to address the
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:17.140]  AIDS epidemic as a medical issue rather than a civil rights issue he wrote the
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:22.180]  book AIDS the unnecessary epidemic the widely circulated pamphlet to deceive a
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:25.640]  nation and more recently a nation deceived and betrayed he also wrote
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:29.940]  Brotherhood of Darkness he his public health approach to HIV epidemic was
[02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:33.940]  eventually accepted by the California Medical Association dr. Montif currently

[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:19.240]  dr. Stan Monteith what is going on my friend one of these people on the inside
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:24.720]  really thinking and planning it because one of the things is being used I guess
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:31.320]  Ron Paul Congressman Ron Paul is in fact he's anti-israel he doesn't want to
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.920]  attack Iran he wants to take away their foreign aid therefore we should back one
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:43.000]  of the other establishment candidates of course the important point that the
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.920]  Congressman Ron Paul brings out is we shouldn't be attacking Iran we should
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:55.640]  stop funding Israel's enemies I mean we give Israel's enemies $12 billion a
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:01.680]  year we give Israel $3 billion a year we control their foreign policy we
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.020]  dominate Israel which is not good for Israel we ought to get blessed and be
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:10.880]  free and look after themselves be a friend with them well I agree with you
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:15.240]  dr. Shannon you're gonna get one of the CFR guys saying here in a moment but now
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:20.720]  Israel's got actual political groups running ads against Ron Paul because he
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.200]  wants to cut off three billion dollars that's a foreign government through
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:30.240]  subsidiaries and proxies running ads in America inside of our political process
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.280]  I think that's illegal well I think it's illegal and basically it's the worst
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:40.680]  thing in the world for Israel if you hate Israel why you certainly want to
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:47.360]  defeat Ron Paul and you want to attack Iran why what does it what about we
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:51.560]  talked about we're talking about the plan that was laid out you can read it
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:57.680]  in the January February issue of Foreign Affairs magazine it's written by a man
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:04.320]  his name is Matthew Cronick he was formerly a chief advisor to the
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:10.560]  Secretary of Defense until July of last year and now he's the Stanton nuclear
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.200]  security fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations assistant professor
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:21.120]  Georgetown University but last week they had a little conference their private
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:26.840]  conference as the Council on Foreign Relations headquarters and since I'm part
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:32.280]  of the media why they sent me the opportunity to get the actual minutes
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:38.200]  of what was said so I wanted to see what this man said in private his name is
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:42.680]  Matthew Cronick and if you read this article in Foreign Affairs magazine he says
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:49.680]  that number one Iran has not decided whether to build a bomb or not number
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:54.960]  two Iran is not building a bomb number three if Iran did start to build a bomb
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:40:04.280]  if Iran said they should keep the international investigators out in the
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:09.320]  National Atomic Energy people in fact if they should do any of these things
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:15.640]  decide to build a bomb start to build a bomb start to invent uranium then we
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:22.080]  ought to attack them and then going from that point of view his article is time
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.640]  to attack Iran well basically first you read the article it doesn't make any
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:31.080]  sense first of all they're not trying to build a bomb they have decided to build
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:35.640]  a bomb but we ought to attack them because they would be such a danger if
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:39.820]  they should ever get a bomb well doctors obviously you're concerned about this we
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:43.920]  all are for those that don't know Israel has come out and says that they see
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:48.000]  Iran's threat the straight though to close the Strait of Hormuz as a empty
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.960]  threat but meanwhile the London Guardian is reporting Iran to restart IAEA
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:59.320]  nuclear talks UN nuclear inspectors are due to begin three days of meetings in
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:04.260]  Tehran on Sunday the first just talks over three weeks Kissinger was in the
[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:08.040]  news yesterday with the headline effect pull it up guys please if you don't hear
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:13.400]  the drums of war your death so clearly the war is on and I think Iran
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:19.040]  understands that right now and may try to come to the table but the way some of
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.800]  the hawks are behaving in Israel and the US they're acting like they don't care
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:26.440]  what Iran does they want this as a political diversion what's your take on
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:30.200]  that how do we stop this and then I want to get Bob Chapman waiting in the wings
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:34.360]  his take well first of all we are already at war with the right I don't
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:39.360]  care what anybody says oh what of course you actually are paying terrorist groups
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:45.120]  to go into Iran and to kill people we gave them several terrorist groups four
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:49.880]  hundred million dollars about three or four years ago to go into this from the
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:56.080]  Iranian government that is an act of war and today they've killed five Iranian
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:03.120]  nuclear scientists several key diplomats those are acts of war and we finance
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:08.240]  that we have our drones flying over their country we have put sanctions on
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:12.200]  them we've sanctioned their central bank so that they can't trade with other
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:17.600]  countries we want to sanction their oil so they can't sell their oil any place
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:25.040]  in the world so they will we are involved with and war with Iran but they
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:29.600]  haven't told the American people this but the frightening thing that chronic
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:37.640]  said was this when we attack Iran why of course Iran we would what we will do
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:41.120]  will be a surgical strike we're not going to go to war with Iran we're not
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:45.480]  going to get troops in what we're going to do is a surgical strike we're going
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:49.640]  to knock out their nuclear production facilities or at least most of them we
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:54.080]  don't leave the production facilities that pay Iran and other cities that is
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:57.640]  where they're in between the uranium and the other centrifuges
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:03.760]  Oh wipe out all the nuclear bases and leave their military intact and leave
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:07.560]  their government intact we're not trying to defeat Iran we're gonna leave
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:13.480]  their military attack intact so they can retaliate why does he want them to
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:17.480]  retaliate well the government has to retaliate to
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:23.000]  maintain the support of the people so he's anticipating and this is all laid
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:28.720]  out this is his plan normally no you're right in fact I meant to call Paul
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:37.280]  Watson and have him write an article West plans Iran false flag or West plans
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:42.840]  sophisticated Iran false flag because it's still a false flag to attack them
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:47.200]  and say that you know they're gonna attack back and what you really want is
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:51.720]  the political diversion while the mega banks are robbing everybody while the
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:55.800]  rights are being abolished while the internet censorship is going into place
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:00.480]  that's what the globalists are really seeking is that wider war and you're
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:05.920]  right he says that and I haven't even really pointed that out and so I'm glad
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:09.720]  you called to point this out we need to make a bigger deal out of this let's get
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:13.960]  Bob Chapman's take on this and then expand on this dr. Monte if we'll have
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:17.800]  you back up for a full hour next week to really flesh this out further but stay
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.880]  with us Bob Chapman this is a big deal isn't it
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:28.240]  it certainly is and when did they started their hijinks about a month ago
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:32.200]  everybody was saying oh we're gonna have a war and here it comes and so on and so
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:38.840]  forth and I said at that time these people are playing games this is a
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:48.080]  diversion logistically they're not ready to go into they'd like to do I think
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:54.520]  that's a year or more away and so I think it's just dancing around but the
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:59.160]  public doesn't know that they're looking over there at Iran waiting for the
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:05.040]  Abraham Lincoln to be blown up going through the Strait of Hormuz when they
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:11.100]  should be looking at pensions and profit sharing and their shares and all of
[02:45:11.100 --> 02:45:16.040]  their investments and whether they're going to be working next week well
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:19.200]  certainly they want the war as a distraction and the threat of war but if
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:23.980]  a war does start Bob that would be a big distraction for the globalist around to
[02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:30.440]  ram a bunch of stuff through you're right probably ultimately it will happen
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:36.920]  because they need it and the Russians are very well aware of this a few weeks
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:46.360]  ago one of their generals said on RT RT television that you get involved in Iran
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.340]  you're gonna have to deal with pressure that's right let's go back let's go back
[02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:58.080]  to dr. Stan motif on that how does Russia and China play into this and why
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:03.480]  would the CFR be so arrogant in an article they put out publicly titled
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:08.980]  time to strike Iran and say for those that don't know this is a main globalist
[02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:13.840]  mouthpiece where they communicate with each other so this is official hey
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:18.200]  they're gonna attack us we're gonna let them attack us I mean why would they be
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:24.440]  so bold as to admit that doctor this is the most amazing thing this article
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:29.640]  which I have on my lap actually came for the transcript the meeting held in
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:35.280]  private for very few people this is not for general oh wait this oh wait you're
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:40.000]  saying this isn't the article I saw he wrote this is separate please read to us
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.440]  what he said and tell us where this is or if you put this online yet I haven't
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:50.440]  put it online but I will tell you what I will have my secretary of actual copy
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:54.720]  of this because I want you to get this information out basically what chronic
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:47:00.320]  says is look basically we're not going to do a lot of harm to the regime we're
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:04.320]  not gonna harm their military we're just going to take out their new
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:09.840]  peer facilities and when the moon wakes up come on he wakes up in the morning
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:14.880]  he's climbed that he's been attacked but his regime is in fact his military is
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:20.440]  intact he's gonna have to do something to retaliate and but we have to be
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:27.880]  prepared to to absorb the retaliation of this remember this is not just a casual
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:35.760]  guy this is a key man of the CFR is a is the standard nuclear security analyst
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:43.880]  for the CFR well how are you getting this information I mean I saw what they
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:47.880]  published on their website you're saying this is the remarks I guess you've been
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:52.560]  in the media so long and they just send you this stuff this is a meeting that
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:48:01.600]  was held last week and basically if you were on their list which I am they tell
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:05.640]  you when they hold these meetings they send the transcript of it and this was
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:09.440]  the most incredible thing I ever read let me tell you what he said they are
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:14.280]  going to retaliate and we're going to have to absorb retaliation and there were
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:18.200]  a couple of people in the audience that says that how could we be sure that
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:23.120]  they're not going to do a lot of damage I mean what happens if they they really
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:27.640]  hurt the United States and then the United States has to then take action
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.440]  against them a second time and of course the response was well I don't think that
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:38.080]  will happen I guess this is what's going to happen but the thing that frightens
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:44.120]  me Alex is that if I were that to be a baby over there maybe I would
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:51.840]  immediately a counter in retaliation by attacking Israel and I mean can Israel
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:57.640]  withstand a thousand missiles two thousand missiles they have about a hundred thousand missiles
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:03.000]  between Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas which is now getting sophisticated
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:10.040]  missiles why in heaven's name would anybody who really supports Israel want
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:14.840]  to actually go along with this thought of a surgical strike on Iran the other
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:19.020]  thing is first they could take out a couple more aircraft okay so what is
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:22.920]  your point why do you think he's saying this well I think it because I think
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:27.600]  this is what they are really thinking about doing and I really believe that
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:32.560]  they put that article out if you read the Wall Street Journal I think it was
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:39.080]  the 18th speak up for us doc there was a fellow named Mark Holford also the CFR
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:44.160]  who wrote an article on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal saying
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:50.160]  essentially the same thing calling for this surgical strike on their brand so
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:54.840]  our children would be safer and their children our children's children would
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:02.400]  be safer obviously they're building support for a surgical strike war this
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:08.480]  is just it is just a surgical strike well I'll tell you what I remember how
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:15.480]  World War one began I remember how I said you know what how it began over in
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:19.680]  the Gulf of talk and we were just gonna have a little short more over there in
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:26.160]  Vietnam and the fact that the former senior advisor the second-day defense
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:32.440]  not only is talked about a surgical strike but yet they see a part of the
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:36.600]  article but this is the Wall Street Journal I think they're thinking about
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:42.440]  they they don't want a major war at this time but what happened if amazing does
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:46.680]  do it logical what happened to be attacked Israel what happens to be six
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.160]  three of our carriers over there yeah this is bizarre and if you think of the
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:54.320]  West is gonna sit back with a retaliation ever that's not gonna happen
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:58.840]  this is beyond bizarre let's get Bob Chapman's take on this and final

[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:20.880]  you know dr. Stan Monteith who's been interviewing myself for 16 years or so
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:25.200]  and Bob Chapman for decades I don't think he's ever contacted me wanting to
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.560]  come on I mean I can always get him on he's a busy guy in his own right so he's
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.040]  obviously concerned about this Iran situation we see what the CFR had to say
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:37.440]  echoed by the New York Times Israel senses bluffing and Iran's threats of
[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:40.680]  retaliation I guess because they threatened to do something aircraft
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:44.760]  carriers if they went back through the state of Hormuz they did this week Iran
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:50.800]  did nothing and here's the CFR saying if Iran responds when Israel hits them we've
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:55.080]  got to take it I don't see the West politically doing that I mean I know
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:59.840]  that it's hypocrisy to hit them and then not let them hit us back but I don't
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:02.880]  think that's gonna happen what do you think's going on here dr. Stan Monteith
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:07.040]  then we'll get Bob Chapman's take well basically of course this is not Israel
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:10.800]  attack not less we're not gonna let this real attack we're gonna do the job
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:16.480]  because according to master chronic we can do a better job of it and but we
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:23.600]  have to win first of all believe the Iranian military power intact and their
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:29.880]  ability to retaliate intact so that we can so they build up support for the
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:33.800]  Iranian government if it were me I thought if I went to war I'd want to
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:39.480]  win the war they don't want to win the war but they anticipate retaliation but
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:45.360]  they think it will be moderate and what frightens me of course is that this
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:52.000]  could very well spell the destruction of Israel and it could spell us being
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.600]  forced to counter whatever they do it if they took out even one carrier and
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:02.640]  killed a thousand American servicemen and they can do it they actually have
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:08.240]  their submarines there in the Persian Gulf if we lost one carrier in response
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:13.120]  to the retaliation what would we be forced to do when you start a war you
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:19.000]  never know how that force at the end well it's definitely crazy yeah we're
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:24.040]  not dealing with rational people this is so irrational as I've read it even
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:29.800]  people in the audience and these are the nationalists attending this meeting at
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:35.480]  the Herald bad house yeah this is the insiders they were shocked I mean we're
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:39.360]  almost out of time here but you know there's a lot of talk about the West
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:42.520]  really put the moolahs in and there's there's evidence to that and I ran
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:46.760]  contra and the rest of it is there any evidence that the moolahs still work
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:50.240]  with the globalist and this could all just be staged I believe that that we
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:55.320]  have our agents planted at the highest level of the government over there why
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:59.880]  in the world with any rational individual like our but does it John go
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:04.160]  out and say we've got a wife Israel off the face of the earth unless he was
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:09.640]  play-acting and wants a justification for a war well we know an attack on Iran
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.040]  will prop up the moolahs that have got less than 30% approval rating we'll talk
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.160]  more about this next week dr. Monteith thank you thank you and and and Bob
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:22.200]  Chapman I know you're on his show every Monday for two hours so you you were
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:24.720]  happy to let him run into some of your time but he's pretty concerned about
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:29.220]  this I hope you're right that it's a year off or may not even happen what do
[02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:35.560]  you think about the Iranians at the top still working for the West well I it is
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:41.080]  but the important thing with Iran is which way is Russia gonna go
[02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:51.800]  another free subject of the Bilderberg is the alumnus a very good question are
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:57.500]  they gonna aid Iran and it becomes a real war or are they gonna say oh we
[02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:02.880]  changed our mind and so that's very very important and we can't answer that
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:11.240]  because I and I and I'm too old to join counterintelligence again all right Bob
