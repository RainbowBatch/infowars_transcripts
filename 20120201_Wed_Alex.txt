[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:39.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.680 --> 00:45.320]  So I'm wound up, my friends, and I'm glad that you have joined us for this worldwide
[00:45.320 --> 00:55.600]  transmission. We are going to be here for the next three hours. It is February 1, 2012.
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.400]  And I do wanna try to shake things up a bit, because what I tend to do is just get into
[00:59.400 --> 01:06.120]  news and issues that get me angry, and that's usually the first or second item I get into.
[01:06.120 --> 01:10.280]  And then not even get to your calls, but we're gonna have wide open phones today. In fact,
[01:10.280 --> 01:15.320]  we had some great guests lined up, but I had them canceled. Because I just want to take
[01:15.320 --> 01:21.000]  your calls and cover the news and go over a wide spectrum of information.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.320]  I wanna explain to you what life's gonna be like in ten years if this new world order
[01:25.320 --> 01:31.920]  continues. You're gonna have combat robots basically on every street corner. The entire
[01:31.920 --> 01:38.120]  Air Force will be drone operated, like Skynet, over the United States. The police will be
[01:38.120 --> 01:40.400]  killing people who don't follow orders.
[01:40.400 --> 01:47.920]  In fact, I forgot to have you guys print court rules. Police can use tasers to make you answer
[01:47.920 --> 01:54.120]  questions. You'll get Florida and New York. And police taser man to make him give urine
[01:54.120 --> 02:01.680]  sample, print me that too. Cuz I wanna point out, this is pain compliance, this is torture.
[02:01.680 --> 02:09.700]  Cuz I saw this two days ago and didn't cover it. And I'm going to cover it today. Where
[02:09.700 --> 02:17.040]  the guy is in a park that for decades has been a off the leash park.
[02:17.040 --> 02:20.680]  And the Forest Service just took it over. I actually know of this park in California.
[02:20.680 --> 02:27.560]  I have a buddy and his wife that take their dogs there. I've been there. And it's in the
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.880]  woods. You're hiking around. There's people with their dogs. It's fun. And they came up
[02:31.880 --> 02:35.200]  and said, we're gonna give you a ticket, stay here. And he goes, I don't have my driver's
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.200]  license and stuff.
[02:36.200 --> 02:40.480]  I just hike here. This has always been an off the leash part. And they said, stay here.
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.120]  Starts walking away. They taser him in the back. And it freaked everybody out that watched
[02:45.120 --> 02:48.800]  him. But this is what it's about. They're getting us ready when they're going to kill
[02:48.800 --> 02:56.280]  us. This is a criminal, sicko, control freak government with goons who were there to break
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.760]  our will, grope our children while their bosses ship in narcotics, kidnap US kids, and fly
[03:01.760 --> 03:04.240]  them out to rape rooms overseas on record.
[03:04.240 --> 03:10.960]  And I don't care if the stupid park rangers and dumb cops out there don't know yet that
[03:10.960 --> 03:18.560]  you work for pure evil. But I'm the one who's here to tell you and explain all this to you.
[03:18.560 --> 03:25.200]  Every movie, every TV show shows checkpoints on highways, men in black uniforms everywhere.
[03:25.200 --> 03:31.200]  Every cop movie I watch now. In fact, I'm gonna do a review of this properly next week
[03:31.200 --> 03:33.480]  on the Nightly News when I have time.
[03:33.480 --> 03:38.200]  But I'll talk about it some today, this morning on the treadmill. I'm starting to get up at
[03:38.200 --> 03:41.880]  like 5 AM now. I ran basically for two hours. It was about an hour and 50 minutes this morning
[03:41.880 --> 03:48.040]  on the treadmill. But I watch Law Abiding Citizen. The whole movie is about how great
[03:48.040 --> 03:49.040]  torture is.
[03:49.040 --> 03:55.320]  The Constitution's the problem. At the end, the cop learns his lesson and says, I know
[03:55.320 --> 04:01.360]  now, basically to get rid of the Constitution by the hero terrorist military black op commander
[04:01.360 --> 04:08.040]  whose family was killed. And the whole thing is this disgusting mind control with checkpoints
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.040]  on highways and black uniforms everywhere.
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.200]  And cops actually watch this, most of them, and fantasize off this false reality. You
[04:16.200 --> 04:20.080]  got a better chance of being killed by champagne corks than by terrorists. That's all part
[04:20.080 --> 04:26.020]  of this false simulation. The average person in the West that watches TV all day lives
[04:26.020 --> 04:29.240]  in a fantasy land.
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.480]  And that's why when you bring up reality to them, they laugh at you because it doesn't
[04:33.480 --> 04:40.120]  jive with their fantasy land. Bill Gates is coming out with a new technology to kill your
[04:40.120 --> 04:47.520]  sperm. He's proud of it, the eugenicist. We've got huge news on Iran that I will cover. Massive
[04:47.520 --> 04:51.840]  news in the economy. Smart meters going in everywhere mandatory to control everything
[04:51.840 --> 05:00.360]  and track what's going on in your house. This threatens the crime boss holder with contempt.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.820]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[05:04.820 --> 05:09.500]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[05:09.500 --> 05:13.480]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[05:13.480 --> 05:17.840]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[05:17.840 --> 05:22.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.080]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[05:28.080 --> 05:32.600]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[05:32.600 --> 05:37.960]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[05:37.960 --> 05:43.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[05:43.640 --> 05:55.320]  a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[05:55.320 --> 06:01.000]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.280]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lung generator infuses the respiratory system with
[06:05.280 --> 06:09.880]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[06:09.880 --> 06:13.720]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[06:13.720 --> 06:19.200]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the silver
[06:19.200 --> 06:23.880]  lungs generator. Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[06:23.880 --> 06:29.440]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[06:29.440 --> 06:35.360]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[06:35.360 --> 06:42.040]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[06:42.040 --> 06:49.040]  to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[06:49.040 --> 06:54.200]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works. As well, we are always ready to answer
[06:54.200 --> 07:00.120]  any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[07:00.120 --> 07:04.440]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now. Here are my top 10 reasons

[08:00.920 --> 08:07.920]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:07.920 --> 08:21.560]  Well, there is no doubt that I am overwrought. John Bound, one of our producers and radio
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.080]  directors here the other day was saying, I feel like I'm in a tank in an info war cruising
[08:27.080 --> 08:33.760]  along blasting the enemy. And I said, no John, you are in the Liberty Command Base, basically
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.740]  a NORAD for freedom worldwide launching ICBMs at the globalist.
[08:39.740 --> 08:45.920]  Make no mistake, our listeners and fellow liberty lovers worldwide are in tanks and
[08:45.920 --> 08:53.060]  climbing over barbed wire and waking up and freeing minds everywhere. 99% of people are
[08:53.060 --> 08:57.660]  basically in a trance, even if you think you're awake. Every day I realize how much more I
[08:57.660 --> 09:05.760]  learn exponentially, it is wild. Every major movie, the news, the drama shows, the children's
[09:05.760 --> 09:08.960]  TV, I challenge you to watch cartoons now.
[09:08.960 --> 09:16.800]  It's anti-family, anti-male, pro-police state, pro-biometric scan to buy and sell, total
[09:16.800 --> 09:23.480]  brainwashing to screw your children up. Watch cartoons, I challenge you to watch what they're
[09:23.480 --> 09:29.360]  watching while you're in there as a man watching Sports Center. Give me beer, baby. She's like,
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.760]  you're so manly, while you're there thinking about how powerful you are and everything.
[09:34.760 --> 09:38.920]  Realize that your water's having poison added to it, you're in a scientific dictatorship.
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.400]  And if you wanna be a real man, you need to wake up to that fact. And a lot of you are
[09:44.400 --> 09:49.000]  awake, but you're like, well, I'm scared of the system. What is this thing with fear?
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.320]  Why do people love it? I'm afraid of being afraid. You understand? I am such a coward.
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.620]  I wanna explain this, this is something I've been trying to articulate to myself. I am
[10:01.620 --> 10:08.360]  such a coward that I'm afraid of being afraid. I am so afraid of giving in and being into
[10:08.360 --> 10:11.040]  fear that I am fearless.
[10:11.040 --> 10:19.960]  I will not be part of this. I will not grovel. You understand that? You've got to laugh at
[10:19.960 --> 10:25.920]  this. It is a mind game. It is a mind trick. It is a joke to serve this new world order.
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.200]  It is so clownish that they've got cops all over the country standing around in black
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.240]  outfits and black helmets with machine guns and police chiefs on record have said it's
[10:34.240 --> 10:35.440]  to scare the public.
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.560]  It's not to make you feel safe. It is a joke when the TSA tries to intimidate you. It is
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.580]  a joke when city council people act arrogant at you like they don't care what you're saying.
[10:45.580 --> 10:53.880]  It is a joke. All of this is meant to break you and train you to be a slave. Not even
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.280]  in an average North Korean town do they have checkpoints and people being groped.
[10:59.280 --> 11:04.860]  Just if anybody reports you for anything, you disappear into a black hole. And it's
[11:04.860 --> 11:10.600]  a culture of groveling and licking the boots of the system. Only here now do people pull
[11:10.600 --> 11:18.400]  up at highway checkpoints randomly set up and are searched. Just thoroughbred, oozing,
[11:18.400 --> 11:26.560]  stinking criminality, oozing, stinking criminality with the government sticking their hands down
[11:26.560 --> 11:27.560]  people's pants.
[11:27.560 --> 11:33.760]  All of this, smart meters. Ten years ago, it's a conspiracy. The San Francisco Chronicle
[11:33.760 --> 11:40.320]  said that these will track your power usage and will control your power. And the engineers
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.600]  from the companies went public, got fired. It all started in California and in London,
[11:45.600 --> 11:46.600]  England.
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.520]  In every case, I've been at events where whistleblowers have actually come. And the integrated circuits,
[11:52.520 --> 11:57.800]  all of it has algorithm systems that track power usage and even know the signature of
[11:57.800 --> 12:02.680]  a certain brand of blender, washing machine, everything cuz it's all been encoded in an
[12:02.680 --> 12:05.680]  industrial program against humanity.
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.000]  I had Stallman, the inventor of free software on just a few weeks ago and he was pointing
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.800]  out it's totally set up as a corporate conspiracy. Of course, they laughed at us and said, it
[12:15.800 --> 12:18.920]  doesn't exist. Then about five years later, they're like, well, we actually are gonna
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.000]  start charging you more when you use too much power with a smart meter.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.480]  And it is tracking everything you do. And now they're coming out with new appliances
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.600]  that actually have chips that tie into the power with data over it. And now they're gonna
[12:31.600 --> 12:37.200]  control the light bulbs in your house, the new fluorescence by law. And actually with
[12:37.200 --> 12:44.200]  burst systems, burst communications, communicate and commandeer your computers, source associated
[12:44.200 --> 12:45.200]  press.
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.840]  Guess where they're already testing it? Police stations across the United States. Started
[12:49.840 --> 12:56.000]  in Minnesota. Now it's moved to many other states and cities, Minneapolis, first city.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.280]  I mean, it is so incredible that we just let the major corporations under globalist banker
[13:02.280 --> 13:10.760]  control, six megabanks, less than 100 megacores under them, bigger than most countries, assassins,
[13:10.760 --> 13:18.720]  spy groups, swallow, prostitute, sex control ops, you name it.
[13:18.720 --> 13:26.560]  I mean, it is just off the charts, what they've got now. And it is all just rolling with our
[13:26.560 --> 13:33.840]  money, our energy, all going into a panopticon surveillance grid where everything is automated
[13:33.840 --> 13:38.080]  and controlled by the central technocrats. That's what I've called them for decades.
[13:38.080 --> 13:41.800]  That's what they now call themselves. Because in their own documents, going back to the
[13:41.800 --> 13:49.760]  70s and 50s and 30s, they call themselves technocrats. 1970 books, Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.520]  he admits the globalists run organized crime. He admits they run mass murder in Cambodia.
[13:55.520 --> 14:00.360]  He admits in all these books, he writes, that they've set up a global technocrat system
[14:00.360 --> 14:06.920]  that they were gonna have it built. And he even lists the very time we're living in now.
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.100]  Where there'll be the entire Air Force drone, combat robots on the ground, total control.
[14:12.100 --> 14:16.360]  And they've already got all the ground robots. They just know that that's really gonna freak
[14:16.360 --> 14:21.320]  people out, and they're not gonna roll those out until the next stage terror attack. And
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.840]  then there'll be robots are watching with their infrared even at night, and they do
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.240]  have weapon systems.
[14:26.240 --> 14:31.040]  They're just now rolling out robots with tasers and things. They use the non-lethal stuff
[14:31.040 --> 14:37.680]  to get you psychologically to begin to see the police attack you with tasers and tear
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.080]  gas. Then they up the power of the taser, up the power of the tear gas, and the billy
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.760]  club strikes. And the arrest for no reason and police said a month ago, balling up is
[14:46.760 --> 14:48.560]  now assaulting and resisting.
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.040]  So felony charges, if you even raise your arm when they're just cracking your brains
[14:53.040 --> 14:58.760]  out, that's an evil. Just overturning logic, overturning every form of checks and balance
[14:58.760 --> 15:06.680]  and decency and everything good and wholesome, pure evil. Now, I'm gonna get into Assad in
[15:06.680 --> 15:11.160]  Syria, Iran, all of that, what happened in Florida, where that's going.
[15:11.160 --> 15:18.580]  S&P warns a further rate downgrade for the US, it's coming. CNBC, housing prices hit
[15:18.580 --> 15:27.080]  post bubble low. ISSA threatens Holder with contempt. See, they got the dirt on ISSA,
[15:27.080 --> 15:29.820]  that's why they don't even fund somebody to run for Congress unless they slip through
[15:29.820 --> 15:30.820]  like Ron Paul.
[15:30.820 --> 15:34.520]  Unless they've got all the car theft records on them, like ISSA, you didn't know about
[15:34.520 --> 15:37.600]  that. I learned something every day, Wayne Madsen told me about that yesterday on the
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.240]  Nightly News and I went and looked it up. And it was just constant records and investigations
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.920]  and indictments for car theft all over the United States, military base, robberies, everything
[15:46.920 --> 15:47.920]  else.
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.920]  And I mean, this is when the guy was older. I mean, that's who runs this country. I'm
[15:52.920 --> 15:58.080]  sorry, it's just unbelievable. And then he started one of the first big anti-theft alarm
[15:58.080 --> 16:07.000]  companies. That's where he made all his money, problem reaction solution. I mean, tyranny
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  translated is rule by criminals, and not just criminals.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.040]  You're lucky if you get a tyranny where it's just criminals, you just want power, just
[16:16.040 --> 16:23.840]  want money. It's usually ruled by psychos. That's why they build the same structures.
[16:23.840 --> 16:32.360]  The black uniform, the surveillance, the spy, the trudging. And their fruits are raping
[16:32.360 --> 16:38.280]  your daughter, poisoning your water, enslaving your society, destroying your job because
[16:38.280 --> 16:41.040]  they want you in the ditch.
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.880]  They want you in the ditch so poor, uneducated, can't read, can't write, and don't know how
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.920]  to defend yourself and unarmed so they can have their way and they are gonna have it
[16:51.920 --> 16:57.920]  good. Now one cannot even cover one of these articles without giving you a little bit of
[16:57.920 --> 17:02.360]  background because when I see an article about a guy at a famous off the leash dog walking
[17:02.360 --> 17:07.240]  park that I've been to in California.
[17:07.240 --> 17:10.740]  And they walk over and say you can't be here. This has been annexed by the Forest Service
[17:10.740 --> 17:15.680]  by the feds. And we're gonna ticket you stay here. And you're like, well, I've always come
[17:15.680 --> 17:20.880]  here. And then you walk off so the woman tasers you in the back with a little control freak
[17:20.880 --> 17:23.920]  while the narcotics are being brought in, the government's running every crime you can
[17:23.920 --> 17:24.920]  imagine.
[17:24.920 --> 17:30.040]  Kids are being arrested for playing tag. All of this is going on, just turning the average
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.160]  person total criminal in front of everyone, freaking out watching it happen. I'm gonna
[17:34.160 --> 17:38.100]  get to the article in a minute what witnesses said. And then the government charging him
[17:38.100 --> 17:43.760]  with a bunch of stuff after the fact.
[17:43.760 --> 17:49.080]  Taser and systems like it, no doubt are killing people. It's been confirmed. I've got the
[17:49.080 --> 17:54.680]  articles, the autopsy reports right here. So what do they do? Then they up the power
[17:54.680 --> 18:01.440]  last year and now they're saying they're gonna up it again until smoke comes out your ears.
[18:01.440 --> 18:07.720]  And so it's the message, you do what we say or die. It's all about incrementalism, the
[18:07.720 --> 18:09.320]  globalists are masters of that.
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.760]  Hey, we got the highest cancer rates, 2, 3,000 times depending on the cancer what they were
[18:12.760 --> 18:17.300]  50 years ago. Hey, our diabetes up several thousand percent, neurological disorders up
[18:17.300 --> 18:20.960]  a couple thousand percent, death all around us. But everybody's just kind of like, well,
[18:20.960 --> 18:22.440]  that's how it is.
[18:22.440 --> 18:27.480]  And I've got all the articles, all the documents that they're doing it to us. Get it, bad people
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.880]  run things. People say, the government's dumb, the big corporations are dumb. No, they're
[18:31.880 --> 18:38.000]  not dumb. They can shoot a cruise missile down your chimney 40 years ago. They went
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.040]  to the moon and beyond.
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.560]  My dad was in college 40 something years ago and they had CD-ROM and all the computer stuff
[18:46.560 --> 18:52.240]  you see now. It just filled up whole rooms. They just had to miniaturize it. You're given
[18:52.240 --> 18:59.360]  the junk. You think the helicopters you see flying over is what the Pentagon really has?
[18:59.360 --> 19:07.940]  It took the richest country on Earth and sucked it dry and built the army of total control
[19:07.940 --> 19:15.960]  and evil. And soon they won't need humans. Soon it's all, I got an article right here.
[19:15.960 --> 19:23.240]  Sandia Labs, bullet doesn't miss. What was that Tom Selleck movie where they've got little
[19:23.240 --> 19:27.180]  robots the guy that Gene Simmons sends to kill people run away.
[19:27.180 --> 19:32.040]  And they've got the little bullets that follow people like little cruise missiles. They had
[19:32.040 --> 19:38.040]  that 30 years ago. They're just getting ready to roll this out. And you're gonna have drones
[19:38.040 --> 19:42.140]  and blimps. They're already there, but they're gonna announce them over every city and they're
[19:42.140 --> 19:44.420]  just gonna kill you.
[19:44.420 --> 19:50.160]  And you're gonna face scan to buy and sell. And if you don't, they're gonna send a truck
[19:50.160 --> 19:54.140]  that pulls up in front of your house. Robots roll out the back and they murder you and
[19:54.140 --> 19:59.280]  your family. And then they burn your house down. And the cops are gonna like it. We'll
[19:59.280 --> 20:00.760]  be right back.
[20:00.760 --> 20:05.640]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century? Record foreclosure

[23:04.440 --> 23:08.800]  kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home. Don't let your home be
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.520]  the next target. Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.920]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[23:17.920 --> 23:22.240]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like
[23:22.240 --> 23:27.240]  a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs
[23:27.240 --> 23:31.800]  far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments. Use it any
[23:31.800 --> 23:37.920]  time you're away from home. To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to FakeTV.com
[23:37.920 --> 23:44.800]  or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and
[23:44.800 --> 23:52.480]  one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV

[24:03.840 --> 24:19.200]  They railed against the crown. Another ragtag band. Another ragtag band. Declaring. They
[24:19.200 --> 24:31.920]  laid their bodies down. On a bloody war. Liberty. By the way, I see it everywhere when the police
[24:31.920 --> 24:37.800]  get in a mob situation like any other human. I've seen it when they knock the peaceful
[24:37.800 --> 24:44.160]  girl off the bicycle clubbing her in the head like wild gorillas and then charge her with
[24:44.160 --> 24:45.520]  a crime.
[24:45.520 --> 24:52.520]  I see it and I see them taser people with pleasure for no reason and get off on it.
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.720]  And I watch the video of them try to set up a veteran in Austin and then not release their
[24:57.720 --> 25:05.280]  own squad car video. I see it and it's just a manifestation of the overall corruption.
[25:05.280 --> 25:13.380]  But look at this Park Ranger story. I was at the Grand Canyon in my RV out investigating
[25:13.380 --> 25:17.860]  things a few months ago and we took a wrong turn at the Grand Canyon and we're turning
[25:17.860 --> 25:20.620]  around just a little turnaround area.
[25:20.620 --> 25:28.960]  And this lights turned on. Park Ranger woman jumped out of the car, ran over, started banging
[25:28.960 --> 25:34.280]  on the door. I opened it up and she said, what are you doing? And who are you? Where
[25:34.280 --> 25:38.840]  are you from? And I was just like, well, we just took a wrong turn. You parked the RVs
[25:38.840 --> 25:39.840]  down that road.
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.920]  And we're like, well, it's nighttime. It's raining. We just took a wrong turn. And she
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.280]  was just all pumped and crazy. These are all people that were either bullies when they
[25:49.280 --> 25:55.000]  were kids or they got beat up a lot. And they're just all crazed and they watch TV all day
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.520]  and they think everybody's out to get them.
[25:56.520 --> 26:00.760]  I mean, I've seen the newscast in Tennessee and other states. I talk about this a lot.
[26:00.760 --> 26:04.720]  We've aired the newscast here where it shows families, whole highways shut down, pulling
[26:04.720 --> 26:11.920]  into these checkpoints with state police and army and Marine Corps National Guard. They'll
[26:11.920 --> 26:17.120]  have MPs from the Air Force there. It was all in the news and TSA is running it. And
[26:17.120 --> 26:24.040]  the cops are just acting more crazed than I would do when I worked for a large animal
[26:24.040 --> 26:26.380]  vet for about nine months.
[26:26.380 --> 26:31.360]  That was rough work. And we'd go out to these big beef ranches and get into pens that would
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.120]  have 500. The worst thing was wild cows, cows that never even vaccinated, dehorned, wild,
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.040]  snorting. They were basically hamburger meat cows. They weren't super quality beef, probably
[26:42.040 --> 26:44.640]  really is good beef, leaner, but all grass fed.
[26:44.640 --> 26:48.920]  And they'd be snorting and ramming and they explained early on, you gotta have total confidence
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.520]  that they're gonna attack you. And so you get in there with that cattle prod and you're
[26:52.520 --> 26:57.040]  just, you have to believe it. The minute you don't believe it, they come after you. And
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.360]  the times, the point is you're running them, trying to force them.
[27:00.360 --> 27:03.880]  It's really hard when you first get in, there's 500. And then you get them down to, they're
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.580]  all tired, there's only 100 or so that haven't gone to the chute. They got electric dehorners
[27:07.580 --> 27:11.680]  hacking their horns off, giving them shots, sometimes branding them the nauseous smell
[27:11.680 --> 27:18.580]  of burning flesh and fur and everything. I don't know why I digressed off of that story.
[27:18.580 --> 27:26.680]  There was a point to me getting into working there and seeing that. Yeah, the cops act
[27:26.680 --> 27:33.480]  more crazed than cowboys in pens with giant animals that wanna kill you. I mean, they're
[27:33.480 --> 27:36.480]  just like.
[27:36.480 --> 27:42.880]  You're mentally ill, your brains are the size of walnuts, it's pathetic. You're under this
[27:42.880 --> 27:46.800]  fantasy land cuz you go home and watch cop shows all day. It's well known cops do this
[27:46.800 --> 27:50.640]  and fantasize where they're the good guys and terrorists are everywhere and people are
[27:50.640 --> 27:52.200]  trying to kill them everywhere.
[27:52.200 --> 27:55.640]  The number one cause of death is hanging your butt out in the highway when you're writing
[27:55.640 --> 28:01.960]  tickets and they finally nationwide are stopping that and coming up on the passenger side.
[28:01.960 --> 28:09.020]  Walnut brains, okay? And the general public are walnut brains too. You've got a big brain,
[28:09.020 --> 28:14.180]  but you only use a walnut portion of it. All right, I've already digressed, I just can't
[28:14.180 --> 28:15.180]  even handle it anymore.
[28:15.180 --> 28:20.080]  This is a total hoax. All of this is a hoax. It's not the law to take vaccines, so they're
[28:20.080 --> 28:25.640]  trying to make it the law, cuz people are waking up. It is not the law that you've gotta
[28:25.640 --> 28:29.560]  have fluoridated water. And so cities are passing laws to kick the lobbyists out and
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.680]  get it out of the water. So the states are passing laws. Well, your laws are a fraud
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.340]  and you're assaulting people, you criminal scum.
[28:37.340 --> 28:41.900]  And it's not just sodium fluoride sevenfold increase in bone cancer and brain damage and
[28:41.900 --> 28:46.360]  all this. They add hundreds of other chemicals with it like lead, arsenic and mercury. You
[28:46.360 --> 28:53.800]  filthy degenerate scumbag city councils who are assaulting everyone. I live in the country
[28:53.800 --> 28:55.300]  now on well water.
[28:55.300 --> 29:00.120]  But let me tell you something, everybody in 72% of the US that's fluoridated, you are
[29:00.120 --> 29:07.040]  assaulted by the scum government. And the scum city councils are all a bunch of buckets
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.840]  of stupid mesmerized idiots who don't realize that just because they have the American Dental
[29:12.840 --> 29:15.800]  Association come up there and tell them it's good.
[29:15.800 --> 29:21.400]  In fact, last night we had a piece McBreen did where he showed the cigarette ads saying
[29:21.400 --> 29:26.200]  doctors say smoke cigarettes and now doctors say aspartame is good. Will you ask him to
[29:26.200 --> 29:31.760]  get that transferred over immediately? I want to play that here. The point is, the point
[29:31.760 --> 29:39.280]  is you are assaulting me, okay? It is, it's funny, you're poisoning our water on purpose
[29:39.280 --> 29:43.040]  and the controllers wrote books on how they're doing this to us, okay?
[29:43.040 --> 29:47.140]  So that's why I'm mad. That's one of about a thousand reasons. I'm awake. I know what's
[29:47.140 --> 29:49.880]  going on. This is normal to get angry.
[29:49.880 --> 30:00.800]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.800 --> 30:05.200]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[30:05.200 --> 30:10.320]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[30:10.320 --> 30:15.820]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[30:15.820 --> 30:21.000]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at
[30:21.000 --> 30:28.040]  info wars team.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds
[30:28.040 --> 30:30.800]  in just two months.
[30:30.800 --> 30:35.640]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound. When I started taking the
[30:35.640 --> 30:41.180]  Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[30:41.180 --> 30:47.120]  Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team.com and

[31:06.560 --> 31:12.920]  foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States
[31:12.920 --> 31:18.260]  is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police States on earth. This film
[31:18.260 --> 31:24.520]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[31:24.520 --> 31:28.780]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[31:28.780 --> 31:33.600]  powerful shadow state police state for Chronicles, the sickening depth to which our Republic
[31:33.600 --> 31:39.880]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners,
[31:39.880 --> 31:45.240]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[31:45.240 --> 31:50.400]  the beginning of the new world orders. Hellish player. The police state isn't coming. It's

[33:26.120 --> 33:32.600]  down. I am like my forebearers. I am primitive. I am angry. I am violent. I am awake. When
[33:32.600 --> 33:38.560]  I get assaulted by criminal scum, hurting my family, and I have to take incredible precautions
[33:38.560 --> 33:45.680]  to try to stay away from GMO on record designed to sterilize my children and give them cancer.
[33:45.680 --> 33:50.100]  Total sterilization within three generations. This is going to be a Holocaust when people
[33:50.100 --> 33:55.240]  figure this out. It's already begun. We're only one generation in, 20 years in. We replicate
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.320]  on average every 20 years, roughly.
[33:59.320 --> 34:02.320]  When it hits number three, can you imagine with cancer and all this stuff already off
[34:02.320 --> 34:10.800]  the charts? They knowingly put chemical weapons in our food. The aspartame is E. coli feces
[34:10.800 --> 34:17.360]  and a chemical weapon that's highly addictive, a neurotoxin. All of this is going on. This
[34:17.360 --> 34:27.280]  is how real all of this is. This is how hardcore. And I see everywhere a militarized internal
[34:27.280 --> 34:34.920]  army class of swarms of agencies and bureaucrats looking at the public and treating us like
[34:34.920 --> 34:38.960]  trash and garbage and the enemy.
[34:38.960 --> 34:44.560]  The bankers have hijacked America. They've declared war on the people with the NDAA and
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.200]  Earthcom, and they are training us to be prisoners and training us to have them put their hands
[34:50.200 --> 34:56.560]  on us and training us to have our children taken away. Government is compartmentalized.
[34:56.560 --> 35:01.420]  At the bottom, you've got a bunch of well-meaning do-gooders on average who are following the
[35:01.420 --> 35:06.860]  fantasy land of TV and what they believe they're really doing. Above them, you've got sociopaths
[35:06.860 --> 35:10.080]  and control freaks and just mercenaries.
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.640]  And above that, you've got actual conscious criminals that understand their level of the
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.520]  scam. And above that, you've got master think tank integrator criminals. And then above
[35:19.520 --> 35:25.320]  that, you've got the mega directors. And above that, you've got a handful of families who
[35:25.320 --> 35:29.080]  are totally given over to evil.
[35:29.080 --> 35:35.260]  You couldn't be or you couldn't serve this system. This is a system built by testing
[35:35.260 --> 35:44.280]  and developing and intermarrying the greatest forms of intelligent black power, black evil,
[35:44.280 --> 35:54.960]  hell force, Satan's spirit, the energy of pure death. You understand? It seeks destruction.
[35:54.960 --> 35:56.640]  That is its beauty.
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.680]  That is its rainbow. That is its light. That is its ether. That is its essence. That is
[36:03.680 --> 36:12.280]  its end game. That is its very existence. That's what it does. And I am here conscious,
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.680]  seeing the plan that's cartoonishly obvious at the grassroots level. I mean, just the
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.420]  basics that freedom is being destroyed, foreign banks are robbing us, world governments being
[36:22.420 --> 36:23.420]  set up.
[36:23.420 --> 36:30.540]  That's all confirmed. Do you know that you've seen nothing yet? That this time we're in
[36:30.540 --> 36:36.940]  will be remembered as heavenly if we don't turn this around. They're now, and I told
[36:36.940 --> 36:45.000]  you this a decade ago, announcing laboratories, hundreds of them, with level four bio weapons
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.200]  in them that kill over 90% of those that come in contact.
[36:48.200 --> 36:53.480]  I know I talk about this every day. The fact that they're announcing it and telling you
[36:53.480 --> 36:59.200]  it's probably gonna get out is them creating the false memory. So when they announce it
[36:59.200 --> 37:05.080]  was an accident, or they announced domestic groups got in and released it, you'll buy
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.240]  that because you've already heard it.
[37:08.240 --> 37:14.160]  It's a gall lighter. It's a ground preparer. They're preparing your mental soil. They're
[37:14.160 --> 37:21.860]  pre-programming. And for someone who lives this and who has proven through my think tank
[37:21.860 --> 37:28.040]  operation that I know what they're doing, I'm sitting here watching a giant boa constrictor
[37:28.040 --> 37:33.320]  coil around our society and tell us it's doing it to protect us from Al-Qaeda when Al-Qaeda
[37:33.320 --> 37:35.520]  publicly works for NATO.
[37:35.520 --> 37:42.280]  On record, Libya, everywhere else, Syria, Iran, everywhere, blowing everything up. And
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.680]  is used again as the skeleton key to open every door to take our rights away. I'm watching
[37:47.680 --> 37:54.220]  the horror. I see the articles every day, people dying from being hit with electroshock
[37:54.220 --> 37:59.020]  lethal weapons. They're actually called less lethal in the book for public consumption.
[37:59.020 --> 38:04.500]  They call them non-lethal. And you notice they've upped the power twice now. The deaths
[38:04.500 --> 38:12.800]  are increasing. It's all incremental. Now, I'm gonna give the number out.
[38:12.800 --> 38:17.480]  And I'll definitely get the calls in the next hour, maybe even this hour. But it's just
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.680]  all coming home here, folks. And we need to really break with the system and break with
[38:22.680 --> 38:28.160]  its lies and really see it for what it is. Most people, even in the media, aren't bad.
[38:28.160 --> 38:33.820]  Most people in the police, the military, aren't bad, in fact, are good. Most people are good,
[38:33.820 --> 38:38.920]  but they're deceived and they play along because they believe what they're being told.
[38:38.920 --> 38:45.260]  We are financing not just our own enslavement, but a giant technological factories totally
[38:45.260 --> 38:51.120]  replacing humans, robots building robots, official Pentagon, no more ground troops,
[38:51.120 --> 38:58.700]  no more nothing. Disenfranchising humans, emasculating humans, just like calculators, where people
[38:58.700 --> 39:02.780]  can't even do basic math, I'm not saying the calculator is bad itself.
[39:02.780 --> 39:10.280]  We need to control technology, not let a technocratic elite build its architecture that we pay for
[39:10.280 --> 39:19.380]  in taxes and our purchases to build in backdoor Trojan horse systems that control us. We need
[39:19.380 --> 39:28.860]  to understand we shape the planet. We shape the architecture. We are involved as men,
[39:28.860 --> 39:35.100]  not just passive people that just live here and accept whatever that programming television
[39:35.100 --> 39:36.300]  assaults us with.
[39:36.300 --> 39:41.180]  The controllers hate us. They write books about how they wanna kill us. They write books
[39:41.180 --> 39:45.380]  about how great it is to unplug grandma, how great torture is, how good it is to get rid
[39:45.380 --> 39:50.540]  of the Bill of Rights, Newsweek, Time Magazine, every cop movie I see, like law abiding citizen,
[39:50.540 --> 39:55.780]  the Constitution is the problem, robots are killing people, all of this to checkpoints
[39:55.780 --> 40:01.540]  on highways, men in black uniforms everywhere, just conditioning the sheeple, conditioning
[40:01.540 --> 40:02.540]  the sheeple.
[40:02.540 --> 40:06.060]  Do you like being conditioned? Do you like being laughed at? Do you like the controllers
[40:06.060 --> 40:12.240]  thinking you're pathetic? Debating Romney, Gingrich and all this, it's all rearranging
[40:12.240 --> 40:19.200]  deck chairs on the Titanic. Winning in this system if you don't overthrow the paradigm
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.840]  is losing. You could have a trillion dollars and go with this system, you're a loser.
[40:24.840 --> 40:33.560]  You can have nothing but wake people up and help humanity and build things that are decent.
[40:33.560 --> 40:40.400]  And you are in the shadow of God. You gotta decide, ladies and gentlemen, which side of
[40:40.400 --> 40:45.600]  this you're on, that's all I can tell you. Because more and more I see the full design
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.060]  of this, and thank God I woke up.
[40:49.060 --> 40:54.300]  Thank God I didn't fall to evil like so many others, or corruption, or decadence, and I'm
[40:54.300 --> 41:01.100]  not perfect by a long shot. My sins are great, but thank God my heart is with God. Thank
[41:01.100 --> 41:08.000]  God at my core I'm a good person. Thank God for that, because the curse of those that
[41:08.000 --> 41:20.080]  have been seduced from birth into corruption is a prison and a commitment to evil.
[41:20.080 --> 41:27.640]  And a commitment to bondage and servitude and pain and humiliation that is such a horrible
[41:27.640 --> 41:37.120]  thing. I even pity the psychopathic twisted generals of the New World Order. I mean, you
[41:37.120 --> 41:45.040]  look at them, you can see in their eyes and their flesh the great burden they're under.
[41:45.040 --> 41:55.680]  Totally taken over by the God of this world, you can see it. Man, the way the evil manifest
[41:55.680 --> 42:07.160]  in those men like Chertoff and Napolitano, Janet Napolitano, and all their little pimp
[42:07.160 --> 42:13.300]  servants, all so they could wear fancy suits and have people open doors for them.
[42:13.300 --> 42:22.180]  Sell their soul to the whole world, what does it profit them? What does it profit a man?
[42:22.180 --> 42:25.360]  And then every day I see articles like this one, this came out a few days ago, I didn't
[42:25.360 --> 42:29.560]  get to it. And then I actually read the whole article this morning, San Francisco Chronicle.
[42:29.560 --> 42:35.360]  Ranger zaps off leash dog walker with a shock weapon. Kesterberg, whose age is unavailable,
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.640]  was arrested on suspicion of failing to obey a lawful order, having dogs off a leash and
[42:39.640 --> 42:40.960]  knowingly providing false information.
[42:40.960 --> 42:47.240]  He said, I don't have an ID. He was released and not returned phone calls. Witnesses said
[42:47.240 --> 42:52.000]  the use of the stun gun and the arrest seemed excessive for someone walking two small dogs
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.040]  off a leash. It was really scary, said Michael Babcock, who said he had seen the incident
[42:58.040 --> 43:00.880]  as she and her husband walked their two border collies.
[43:00.880 --> 43:06.040]  I just felt so bad for him. Babcock said Hasterberg had repeatedly asked the Ranger why he was
[43:06.040 --> 43:11.160]  being detained. She didn't answer him, Babcock said. He just tried, it's not detained, it's
[43:11.160 --> 43:16.620]  arrested, okay, it's an arrest, it's a custodial arrest. He just tried to walk away. She never
[43:16.620 --> 43:18.280]  gave him a reason, Babcock said.
[43:18.280 --> 43:24.200]  The Ranger shot Hasterberg in the back with a shock weapon as he walked off, Babcock said.
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.060]  We were into disbelief, they had to call an ambulance for him. They're so powerful now
[43:27.060 --> 43:32.740]  that it's killing people all the time. I got some of the autopsies here. It didn't make
[43:32.740 --> 43:38.640]  any sense. Rancho Del Terra has long been an off the leash walking spot for local dog
[43:38.640 --> 43:39.640]  owners.
[43:39.640 --> 43:42.460]  Yeah, I've been with friends there on walk your dogs. In December, the area became part
[43:42.460 --> 43:46.920]  of the National Park System, which requires that all dogs be on a leash. That's not enough
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.800]  to have like 85% of the land out west, the feds gotta have more. Levitt said, the Ranger
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.400]  was trying to educate residents on the rule, I'm sure she did.
[43:55.400 --> 44:02.280]  The Park Service is investigating the incident, he said. And I mean, it was like me at the
[44:02.280 --> 44:07.120]  Grand Canyon, we took a wrong turn, we're on a road. We're turning around and lights
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.920]  go on, she runs up, bangs on the door, we open, it's like, what are you doing here and
[44:10.920 --> 44:11.920]  who are you?
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.880]  And it's just a RV, and we're like, we're looking for the RV parking area? She was like,
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.960]  get out. And I got out, just as my wife and kids were there, I just played along and let
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.200]  her have power. And I said, I'm sorry, we're just looking for a way to park. She goes,
[44:27.200 --> 44:31.600]  it's down there, take a turn, such and such.
[44:31.600 --> 44:35.480]  And because I play along with it, she said, here, I'll show you where it is. And by the
[44:35.480 --> 44:43.080]  end of it was, still another cop car came and she had tasers and guns and everything
[44:43.080 --> 44:47.400]  and they were still kind of shaking their heads. But since I act, I kind of played like
[44:47.400 --> 44:48.400]  I was an idiot.
[44:48.400 --> 44:51.240]  And they liked it, they got real comfortable and we're like, it's over there. And then
[44:51.240 --> 44:54.160]  she was like, I can't believe I can't park. They were kind of looking at us like we're
[44:54.160 --> 44:59.000]  pathetic and I just did it as a psychological test. I kind of went, and they got real happy
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.480]  when I acted like I was a fluoride head and I accidentally retarded, they got real pleased
[45:03.480 --> 45:04.480]  by that.
[45:04.480 --> 45:07.760]  And it was just a little test, I was just, here, I'm gonna act like a jellyfish with
[45:07.760 --> 45:15.320]  these people. So I just got off and went, what? But again, just bum rushing up like
[45:15.320 --> 45:25.880]  we had engaged in the murder of small children. And it goes on here that, they said, give
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.880]  me identification.
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.600]  He said, I don't have any, I'm just walking my dogs. There were two small lap dogs. He
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.000]  said, well, if you won't tell me why I'm here, and he asked over and over again, I'm gonna
[45:36.000 --> 45:45.480]  leave, and he just tasered him in the back. And it's gonna get worse. The Huffington Post
[45:45.480 --> 45:48.600]  is upset, all the liberals love to go walk their dogs there.
[45:48.600 --> 45:54.440]  You're gonna find out it's not gonna get any better. I thought I'd read an American Dream
[45:54.440 --> 45:59.220]  article that's up at infowars.com, 19 crazy things that school children are being arrested
[45:59.220 --> 46:04.000]  for in America. And some of these happen this week, let me read to you these. I've seen
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.360]  people arrested for having a Bible in their bag at school.
[46:07.360 --> 46:14.780]  Yeah, what happened to First Amendment? And there's links to all these articles. At one
[46:14.780 --> 46:19.880]  public school in Texas, a 12-year-old named Sarah Bustamante was recently arrested for
[46:19.880 --> 46:24.520]  spraying herself with perfume. Number two, a 13-year-old student in Albuquerque, New
[46:24.520 --> 46:27.520]  Mexico recently arrested by police for burping in class.
[46:27.520 --> 46:32.160]  I've seen them arrest people for that, yeah. Another student down in Albuquerque was forced
[46:32.160 --> 46:38.240]  to strip down to his underwear while five adults watched because he had $200 in his
[46:38.240 --> 46:42.200]  pocket. The student was never formally charged with anything wrong. Well, cops here in Texas
[46:42.200 --> 46:45.040]  take money from old ladies if you got money, you're not supposed to have that as a slave.
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.360]  No judge, no jury, no arrest. Number four, a security guard at the school in California
[46:49.360 --> 46:52.920]  broke the arm of a 16-year-old girl because she left some crumbs on the floor after cleaning
[46:52.920 --> 46:54.760]  up some cake that she'd spilled.
[46:54.760 --> 47:00.720]  Number five, one teenage couple down in Houston poured milk on each other during a class squabble
[47:00.720 --> 47:04.600]  while they were breaking up. Instead of being sent to the principal, they were arrested
[47:04.600 --> 47:10.160]  and sent to court. Number six, we got 6 million people in prison. I mean, you got the biggest
[47:10.160 --> 47:12.920]  prison population in the world, it's a good thing.
[47:12.920 --> 47:16.040]  In early 2010, a 12-year-old girl at a school in Forest Hills, New York was arrested by
[47:16.040 --> 47:21.080]  police and marched off to school in handcuffs because she drooled on her desk while asleep.
[47:21.080 --> 47:25.600]  I love my friends, I mean, while she doodled, I saw another one who was arrested for drooling.
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.840]  I love my friends, Abby and Faith was what she reportedly scribbled on her desk. That
[47:30.840 --> 47:36.400]  was another case that I don't even see in here where it was falling asleep and drooled.
[47:36.400 --> 47:39.800]  Number seven, a 6-year-old girl from Florida was handcuffed and sent to the mental facility
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.660]  after throwing a temper tantrum in her elementary school. Number eight, one student down in
[47:43.660 --> 47:48.840]  Texas reportedly arrested by police for throwing paper airplanes in class.
[47:48.840 --> 47:54.160]  Number nine, a 17-year-old honor student in North Carolina named Ashley Smithwick accidentally
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.120]  took her father's lunch with her at a school that contained a small paring knife, which
[47:58.120 --> 48:02.840]  she would use to slice up apples. So what happened to the standout student when the
[48:02.840 --> 48:05.960]  school discovered this? The school suspended her for the rest of the year and the police
[48:05.960 --> 48:07.400]  charged her with a misdemeanor.
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.920]  Obviously, people arrested for Dixie knives, little plastic knives, just bread and butter.
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.600]  Number ten, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a 14-year-old girl was tasered in the groin
[48:15.600 --> 48:20.640]  area by a school security officer even though she had put her hands up in the air to surrender.
[48:20.640 --> 48:24.360]  Eleven, down in Florida, an 11-year-old student was arrested, thrown in jail, and charged
[48:24.360 --> 48:27.680]  with third-degree felony for bringing a plastic butter knife to school. Yeah, there's one
[48:27.680 --> 48:28.680]  of those.
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.960]  I hadn't even read all these. Number 12, back in 09, an 8-year-old boy in Massachusetts
[48:32.960 --> 48:36.240]  was sent home from school and was forced to undergo psychological evaluation because he
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.160]  drew a picture of Jesus on the cross. 13, a police officer in San Mateo, California,
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.000]  blasted a 7-year-old special education student in the face with pepper spray because he would
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.400]  not quit climbing on furniture.
[48:47.400 --> 48:52.840]  Fourteen, in America today, a 5-year-old children are treated brutally by police. The following
[48:52.840 --> 48:57.040]  is a recent article that described what happened when a young student in Stockton, California
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.600]  a while back. The student was handcuffed and zip-tied on his feet, forced to go to the
[49:02.600 --> 49:08.080]  hospital for psychiatric evaluation, was charged with battery of a police officer for jumping
[49:08.080 --> 49:09.320]  up and throwing a tantrum.
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.860]  Fifteen, that's a 5-year-old. Now again, they won't let teachers or parents discipline their
[49:13.860 --> 49:18.000]  kids or imply you'll get arrested. Then everybody runs around like crazy. Then they just take
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.480]  you to a facility where you're raped by pedophiles at juvenile hall. Here in Texas, the entire
[49:23.480 --> 49:25.760]  youth commission, they had gladiatorial fights.
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.800]  Judges, lawyers, locals came to rape them, just like Sandusky and the alumni coming to
[49:30.800 --> 49:34.360]  rape the kids. It's coming out in the news. I mean, it's just a bunch of pedophile criminals
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.320]  run things. And they know psych warfare. They know if you teach kids to have no discipline,
[49:38.320 --> 49:41.860]  give them a bunch of Coca-Cola and a bunch of sugar and red dye.
[49:41.860 --> 49:45.280]  And they're all mentally out of control. Then you just taser them and teach them how to
[49:45.280 --> 49:49.920]  be prisoners. See, only the state can have authority. Kind of like in England where you
[49:49.920 --> 49:53.160]  can't even defend yourself in your own home or you go to jail. They throw the book at
[49:53.160 --> 49:56.160]  people that even fight someone raping your wife.
[49:56.160 --> 50:02.060]  Fifteen, at one school in Connecticut, a 17-year-old boy was thrown to the floor and tasered five
[50:02.060 --> 50:07.480]  times before he was yelling at a cafeteria worker. Again, because he yelled at a cafeteria
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.400]  worker. Sixteen, a teenager in suburban Dallas was forced to take out a part-time job after
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.000]  being ticketed for using foul language in one high school classroom.
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.080]  The original ticket was 340, but additional fees have raised the fine to 637. Number 17,
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.080]  a few months ago, police were called out when a little girl kissed a little boy during a
[50:25.080 --> 50:31.080]  physical education class at an elementary school in Florida. Eighteen, a six-year-old
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.280]  boy was recently charged with sexual battery for touching someone during a game of tag
[50:36.280 --> 50:41.840]  in San Francisco. Nineteen, Massachusetts police recently sent out to collect an overdue
[50:41.840 --> 50:45.200]  library book from a five-year-old girl. It goes on and on.
[50:45.200 --> 50:51.400]  Now, when I come back, they're killing people with tasers, and they're now tasering you
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.040]  if you don't answer questions. In fact, that's what they say here. He didn't follow the police
[50:56.040 --> 51:00.280]  order to answer his questions, so he was tasered. No Fifth Amendment.
[51:00.280 --> 51:04.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[51:04.720 --> 51:09.880]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[51:09.880 --> 51:13.520]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[51:13.520 --> 51:16.880]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[51:16.880 --> 51:21.440]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[51:21.440 --> 51:27.880]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[51:27.880 --> 51:32.160]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have

[51:54.720 --> 51:59.520]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[54:21.280 --> 54:30.600]  In Florida and in New York, judges have ruled, you can just type in judge rules, you can
[54:30.600 --> 54:36.800]  taser suspects to make them answer questions. Now, that's a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[54:36.800 --> 54:40.960]  That's torture, they call it paying compliance. And it was all tested out on pro-lifers, in
[54:40.960 --> 54:47.840]  my film Martial Law. In the extra addendum, there's the footage of police in the 80s and
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.480]  90s breaking people's arms for sitting on sidewalks.
[54:51.480 --> 54:57.160]  And you see the arms broken, compound fractures, big purple bones popping out. Bones are white
[54:57.160 --> 55:02.480]  when you're dead, folks, they're purple. Blood spurting, cops getting off on it. I mean,
[55:02.480 --> 55:05.700]  you can see them break a guy's arm and the cops pull a billy club over and get in a little
[55:05.700 --> 55:10.080]  psycho enjoyment. Because they dare sit out front of clinic and try to stop something
[55:10.080 --> 55:11.080]  there.
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.520]  And I'm supposed to just think that's freedom. All of that is coming to the general public.
[55:15.520 --> 55:19.680]  Because the foreign banks want you to sit there while they take your farm, your ranch,
[55:19.680 --> 55:25.240]  your business, your tax money, through taxes, through regulations, through property taxes.
[55:25.240 --> 55:31.400]  And they want you to learn that it's normal, and that it's loving, and that it's good when
[55:31.400 --> 55:35.760]  the system does it. And then the system spends this and says, you're being anti-cop. No,
[55:35.760 --> 55:40.520]  I'm anti the police being turned into an army of darkness.
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.080]  I told you they'd use the military against us. I've seen the training forever. I told
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.440]  you they'd take guns. They've done it in drills across the country and in New Orleans. Now
[55:48.440 --> 55:53.180]  they're saying they're gearing up for it. I'm the best friend the military and the police
[55:53.180 --> 55:54.900]  will ever have.
[55:54.900 --> 55:59.180]  Because if this thing goes to a civil war, I will guarantee you it's not gonna be a cakewalk
[55:59.180 --> 56:03.720]  for you. People aren't gonna wait in their houses for you to come SWAT team them at home
[56:03.720 --> 56:08.960]  once the gloves comes off, buddy pal. I just hear the police are all gonna lock themselves
[56:08.960 --> 56:13.340]  up in their little armored fortresses, and society's gonna collapse.
[56:13.340 --> 56:17.500]  And nothing's gonna move down the roads, and that's what the globalist plan in a civil
[56:17.500 --> 56:21.900]  war. It's in the IMF World Bank documents that I do it in third world countries. And
[56:21.900 --> 56:29.220]  a year later, after the rioting and the problems, people will beg for the military. Let's not
[56:29.220 --> 56:34.640]  go down this road. Let's not all be played as chumps. Here are some of the articles.
[56:34.640 --> 56:41.760]  This is from the article at a police officer website. This is actually an AP story, no,
[56:41.760 --> 56:50.040]  it's Reuters. Taser upping ZAP power. And this is from a year ago, the second time they
[56:50.040 --> 56:56.760]  upped the power. There's not enough death from it, so you gotta up that power. Tasers,
[56:56.760 --> 57:00.320]  police torture weapons, AFN.org.
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.440]  And it goes on to say, Orange County police use a taser gun on an 18-year-old Orlando
[57:04.440 --> 57:09.480]  man who was tied to a hospital bed. The reason was the man refused to give a urine sample.
[57:09.480 --> 57:13.920]  And so they just began to taser him, and taser him, and taser him until he answered the question.
[57:13.920 --> 57:17.560]  And then we've got it in Kalamazoo Gazette, where the sheriffs did it. We've got it in
[57:17.560 --> 57:22.760]  the Olympian, where they did it in another place. And they've got all the town's articles
[57:22.760 --> 57:28.180]  where they're doing it everywhere. Tell me who you are, didn't boom, I'm gonna taser
[57:28.180 --> 57:29.180]  you.
[57:29.180 --> 57:33.400]  No Fifth Amendment, that's torture. And what do they say? What does the park ranger say
[57:33.400 --> 57:39.800]  when she tasered him? He's charged and was tasered for failure to obey a lawful order.
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.240]  Really? Gotta answer your question. And the cops actually believe that's a lawful order.
[57:44.240 --> 57:48.280]  Cuz they got criminal judges and criminal prosecutors, most of them a bunch of narcotics
[57:48.280 --> 57:54.280]  traffickers, all on the take, sitting there, telling you you can do that. No, you can't,
[57:54.280 --> 57:55.840]  scum, it's called the Fifth Amendment.
[57:55.840 --> 58:03.380]  Shove it in a pipe and shove it in there good and smoke it. Now I'm gonna give the number
[58:03.380 --> 58:06.920]  out and I'm gonna take some calls. And when I'm done going to some of those, I'm gonna
[58:06.920 --> 58:11.960]  show you and play you for radio listeners and TV viewers. I'm gonna show you tobacco
[58:11.960 --> 58:17.280]  ads for kids, telling them it's good, Fred Flintstone likes it. And I'm gonna show you
[58:17.280 --> 58:21.760]  doctors on TV saying cigarettes are delicious and wonderful.
[58:21.760 --> 58:27.960]  And I'm gonna then show you Flintstones today saying aspartame's good for the kids, okay?
[58:27.960 --> 58:35.800]  They know it's a Pentagon chemical weapon developed by the Pentagon to kill you and
[58:35.800 --> 58:39.560]  your family. The government is murdering criminals.
[58:39.560 --> 58:50.880]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.880 --> 58:55.160]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now. Here are my top 10 reasons
[58:55.160 --> 58:59.680]  to stock up on food from eFoods Direct. Number 10, the food I get from eFoods Direct

[59:25.920 --> 59:30.800]  supply and don't depend on the grocery store. And the number one reason I promote eFoods

[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:21.520]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:38.560]  I mean, I'm sick of it. I'm tired of being assaulted. I haven't spent all my time trying
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.000]  to avoid poisoned food and poison water. Got a bunch of globalist eugenicists murdering
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.080]  everybody, running around lecturing me all day about how it's good for the environment.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.000]  My carbon dioxide's bad, but they're GMO killing all the honeybees and screwing everything
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.440]  up's good. And thousands of studies that sterilizes every rodent they feed it to.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:05.800]  I mean, we are in a world of hurt. And I wanna shake people out of their morass. So many
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:11.100]  days I get up here and just control myself and get gassed on. And I'm gonna be honest
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.120]  with you about 90% of the time, I know more than all the guests do. And I just sit here
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.440]  cuz I like to talk to somebody else and hear their perspective and then I interrupt when
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440]  I wanna make a point.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.720]  It's good to have somebody like Ron Paul or Ellen Watt on because they know as much as
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:31.080]  I do or more. Or you get people on the show that understand part of the equation and are
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:37.000]  really smart in that area and surpass you in knowledge. When you do research later,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.880]  you understand they've got a specialty area, but then they're real stupid in other areas.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:50.280]  And I mean, I guess we all are, it's just, I'm not enemies with the globalist enforcement
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.640]  idiots. I realize they're just like the general public, they're under mind control. They're
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:03.300]  brainwashed in 100 different ways, but it doesn't make them any less dangerous.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:10.880]  It doesn't make them any less more out of control. It doesn't make them any less disgusting.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:16.900]  And I'll try to get through to as many people as I can. But I've just gotten to the point
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.720]  where I'm not gonna mince words anymore and I'm not gonna play games with people. You've
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.840]  probably noticed I'm not talking much about the election.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.600]  You've probably noticed I'm not talking about a lot of big issues. This one with Bill Gates
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.480]  comes out with a new product that sterilizes men. I'll be telling you about that. See,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.960]  this show is actually about what's really affecting us. Now within election 2012, we
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.740]  can inform folks about propaganda, spam, manipulation.
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:50.060]  Within it's acting like he's going after Holder, but having to back off and Holder played the
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:58.000]  ace card, the ace of spades, that George W Bush was involved in a previous program, identical.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:06.720]  Of course, I told you months before that Holder would play that card and he did. I mean, if
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.520]  you figured out, we know what we're talking about. If you figured out there's thousands
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.400]  of flavors of bull, this ain't where it's at.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.800]  You know how creepy it is to know I'm right? You know how creepy it is that so many other
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.480]  people don't get it when it's so obvious, and how dangerous that is, and how freaky
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.660]  that is? That I'm sitting here knowing what their next moves are, knowing exactly how
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.660]  they're operating, seeing all the crimes they're committing.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:35.920]  And I've got to watch zombie public go around all day, and I've got to watch cops going
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.680]  around bugging their eyes out at the public. They're not as bad here in Austin on average.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.640]  I've been in other parts of the country though, where they've got departments where they've
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.680]  pushed a thugism, and I mean, it is disgusting. These are idiots having their food and water
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.960]  jacked, their children slow killed, their whole future destroyed, their pension funds
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.840]  already raided. They just haven't retired yet, that's been announced.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:01.800]  And if you try to walk up to them in a restaurant, they will flip out. I saw a bunch of special
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.600]  forces command people at 9-11, who I know were involved in the secret security operations.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.360]  I saw them in a restaurant, and I walked up to them about it, and they all stopped eating,
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.120]  got up and left. One of the places you go through and get the food, the deli, and go
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120]  sit in the back.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.040]  One of them obviously knew who I was, there's even video of this on the web, I think we
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:27.520]  put it on the web, got up and left. Because I walked right up about NORTHCOM operation
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:34.600]  PDD 51, Threat Fusion Center, code integration, and what you're doing is illegal. And they
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:39.620]  just looked at me like, one of them was a colonel, just got up and left.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:44.320]  Because nationals, they couldn't even be there when I was saying all that stuff. I see, I
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  got the sunglasses, pal, I see it! And I'm sick of it, I'm like Rowdy Piper, I'm like,
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:05:00.600]  you're going to put them on! Put them on! I'm not asking! Put them on!
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.580]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.900]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:18.960]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.000]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.740]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:31.160]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.200]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.640]  related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.720]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.360]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:59.400]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:06.200]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs generator.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.040]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.240]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.920]  The Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:31.180]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:35.480]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:41.160]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs generator. Very easy
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:46.040]  to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.960]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:07:01.760]  the Silver Lungs generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.320]  Thousands of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.640]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.640]  be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:19.200]  I have tremendous influence on our president and congress and they really are calling the
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.280]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.520]  citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies the enemies of
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.920]  our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:37.560]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.680]  They're asking for more matches and the congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.860]  of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:58.520]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:06.660]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:14.520]  a war on for your mind. All right, here's the deal. I'm going to take
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:23.640]  a pass of calls. Then I'm going to get into the addendum of the man on the street interview
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:28.280]  that Darren McBrain did yesterday that we aired premiered here yesterday on the radio
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:35.680]  slash TV show where he went out and asked folks if they know about aspartame causing
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.400]  brain tumors and the rest of it, stuff that's in tens of thousands of products, including
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:46.800]  most sugar candy now, and has added all sorts of finished products to casseroles to TV dinners.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.840]  It's in there because it's a special little thing the Defense Department masterminds want
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.360]  you to have. Because Al-Qaeda admittedly works for them and Amarillo Al-Awlaki, number three
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.500]  in Al-Qaeda, hung out secretly at the Pentagon and then I predicted they'd stage his death
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.500]  and two months later they did.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:08.040]  I mean, that wasn't hard. Cover blown, staged the death. The guy isn't dead. He's with Whitman
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:13.880]  Price and the Dodd, basking in the Maui sun, their debt to society paid in full. We don't
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:20.480]  lie, we're the running man, the number one television show in the whole wide world. And
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.720]  who loves you and who do you love?
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.200]  It's all theater, ladies and gentlemen, till you break the matrix. And their system isn't
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:35.140]  complete yet. That's how we're on over 100 AM and FM's. XM, global shortwave, number
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:39.360]  one on the web, but now they're coming to censor talk radio and censor the Internet.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.680]  They're bringing down Greece, they're bringing down Europe, they're bringing in their world
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.680]  government.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.000]  They're announcing the tyranny. They're saying, okay, we wanna use the army. I told you they've
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.560]  been preparing the military behind the scenes to be used against us for a long time. We
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.160]  had the documents, congressional hearings, but the establishment media would say, that's
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160]  a conspiracy.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.160]  Don't listen to that man. And they'll go out and build a straw man of fake information
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.200]  to then discredit that. A fake FEMA camp, a fake military drill. All the real stuff's
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.480]  right there. Darren was pointing out that on Snopes and all these George Soros type
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.600]  outfits, they discredit that aspartame is bad for you, but then go and it's straw man
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.600]  baloney.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.840]  You see, they don't discredit the real facts. It's these tricks, you learn the tricks, they're
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:31.120]  so ridiculous. We've got all their own studies of what it does. The studies on what fluoride
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:38.360]  does, look it up. The studies on, I mean, these GMO crops are so bad, folks, that when
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:45.000]  the honeybees eat the pollen in major German studies, Chinese studies as well, they die.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.460]  Yeah, the plant makes its own pesticide and then you eat it. And Monsanto says, well,
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:58.920]  this fungus naturally grows on corn. Yeah, and the bugs don't eat it when it's one one
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.440]  thousandth of what this corn grows inside of it.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.200]  And then ignorant people always send me emails going, they don't have corn that grows stuff.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.040]  I'll never forget the guy at Conan's Pizza, my wife was pregnant. I went to get a pizza.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.480]  The reason I mentioned she was pregnant, I remember the time with our firstborn. And
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.560]  I go into Conan's Pizza and a guy, I'm about to pick the pizza up, and he pokes me in the
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560]  back.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.360]  And I turn around and go, how can I help you? He goes, I used to like your show. I used
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:37.880]  to like it. I don't now. There's no such thing as spider goats. This is ten plus years ago.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.160]  And I said, well, I mean, just type it into a search engine. He goes, no, I don't need
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.240]  to, you're a liar. And I said, well, you go ahead and believe whatever you want, but don't
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.360]  call me a liar. And don't give me that look on your face like I've done something wrong.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.380]  I go, how do you know there's not spider goats? He goes, I went to the University of Texas
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:00.040]  and took biology. And I said, when did you take it, in the 70s? And he goes, yeah, 1970,
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.040]  whatever, and it was 73 or something.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:07.260]  And I just went, okay, pal. But at first, he was real self-righteous, and I didn't really
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:14.400]  bow up to him. I just said, don't call me a liar. You know what? See, his brain wasn't
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.720]  ready for splicing of goats and spiders. He didn't think they could do that. I mean, they'd
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.120]  had it for ten years before that.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.840]  They declassified it about a year before this guy confronted me. I had the CEO of one of
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.720]  the companies from an upstate New York base. I know they freaked out later, and it was
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:40.140]  a big fracas when he came on, boy. That upset the Pentagon. Like the time I got the director
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.720]  of harp on. He started talking about how they ignite the atmosphere, and the colonel came
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.960]  on and shut the interview down.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:13:03.680]  Boy. There it is, BBC, the goats with spider genes and silking their milk. What year is
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:13.000]  that? Point is, if you're a new listener, and you're driving around all official laughing
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.560]  at me right now, let me just tell you something. You better look into what I'm saying. 2012,
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.400]  that's just a new article on it, yeah.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.920]  You better, I mean, here's an example. I could appear and say, DynCorp was caught running
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.400]  child kidnapping rings in Europe. And DynCorp is the biggest subsidiary controller of private
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:37.120]  CPS agents in the United States. I mean, that is an acclaim, that's admitted, go look it
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.920]  up. I don't care if it sounds crazy, you better look up.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:49.640]  You don't have time to play games anymore. I mean, I go to a neurotic level to prove
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.360]  everything I say. Like I start saying they taser people to make them answer questions
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.000]  now, and that's a torture and a violation of Fifth Amendment. And the Geneva Convention
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:03.920]  and the Nuremberg Code and Common Sense and every candidate of a free society.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.240]  But I actually went and had them pull the Reuters and AP articles and showed it to you.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.460]  And then the articles are reporting it like it's good. They're like, well, this is good.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.440]  They torture people now. They're like, it's reasonable and this judge says it's okay.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:23.600]  See, a lot of times the mainstream media doesn't lie. They go, yeah, they take a million, six
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.860]  children a year. And they do have the highest rate of abuse once they're in government custody.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.600]  But they need more funding, that's why, so they can do more of it.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.420]  We do have more drug use and more people in prisons under the drug war. The answer is
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:45.960]  get rid of more rights and hire more police. Really, who pick up the users of the globalist
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:53.580]  product? See, you think the drug war is failing, it's a success. You think education's failing,
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.720]  it's a success, it's on record to dumb you down.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.820]  You think all this stuff's a failure, none of it's a failure. Afghanistan's not a failure,
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.400]  it's get 500 billion of opium out, control the pipelines, export al-Qaeda that works
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.380]  for the West into, this is what the government of Pakistan's saying, to destabilize Pakistan
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:20.000]  so you have an excuse to then attack them.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.200]  Pakistan is a devastating success, ten and a half years on, not a failure. You're told
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:32.040]  all day how it's a failure, but we can't quit. We've got to stay and win, no more Vietnam
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:40.080]  syndrome. Vietnam was a devastating success. 58,000 dead Americans, millions of dead Vietnamese,
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.160]  hundreds and hundreds, in total trillions, even in that day's numbers, of opium all over
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.000]  the world shipped in in the caskets on record congressional reports.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.760]  Total corruption, getting our military addicted for heroin sales back in the US, starting
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.760]  the market just like giving kids crack. The CIA started the crack epidemic on record,
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:04.400]  created the ingredients, how to get it out, how to sell it, everything, everything. This
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:11.000]  isn't our government, it's eugenicists psychopath murderers who see us as trash that are in
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  control.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.720]  I'm gonna go to your calls. And then coming up, ISSA threatens holder with contempt, Genrich,
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.800]  ballot fraud. Virginia election officials confirm criminal investigation. Genrich is
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:30.240]  being charged so far with 1,500 alleged cases of ballot petition fraud. Sandia Labs, a bullet
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:37.240]  that is laser guided. Obama and drones, you're not supposed to talk about the drones cuz
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.240]  of national security.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.440]  No, you're not supposed to talk about it cuz it's so immoral, so illegal, and it's gonna
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.520]  replace humans and make the technocrats very powerful. We can beat them right now, but
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.520]  we gotta take control of the architecture. We've gotta start discussing the fact that
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:57.800]  everything's being built as an architecture of control and have a say in that.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.520]  Like Dr. Stallman and others say, and we've gotta start voting with our dollars now for
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:09.180]  open free architecture. And this is such a master plan we're facing, but it's outrageous.
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:17.140]  And so if we just fight it, we can win. Their biggest tool was false flag terror. We've
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:23.040]  gotta expose that. We've done that. Now they have trouble using it cuz our people are watching
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.220]  every time they do stage an underwear bombing or whatever, and catch them.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:31.920]  They're off balance. They're not invincible. They can be defeated, but they learn don't
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:40.260]  try with an army up front. Creep in, brainwash, use psychological warfare. God, the Iran situation.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.280]  Let's go to your calls. Matt in California, welcome.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:49.520]  Alex, all right, I got an update. Once you posted that article about that Lupine Hills
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:55.200]  school, about the six-year-old, the tag thing, I live right there. I went to that school.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:01.240]  And let me tell you exactly how that school operated when I went there. We had an accelerated
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:07.320]  class in fourth and fifth grade. We had our teacher that was feeling everybody up, got
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.160]  away with it. They put him on a little probation for like a week or two. This person brought
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.360]  in people on foreign exchange studies.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.840]  People were giving people ringworm and stuff. They're not doing anything. Every-
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:24.320]  Now they're filthy, disease-filled prisons where pedophiles operate 24-7, and they push
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.600]  Ritalin and Prozac on everybody. Yeah, it's just their hell pits.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.400]  Complete joke. And every single school in this city, you should, man, you pull up a
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.600]  Google map, you pull it up, 20-foot tall fences. These things, 15 years ago wasn't there and
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:44.240]  everything. We got these crazy cops and everything doing all this stuff. It is completely bonkers
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.240]  what is going on.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:50.280]  And people need to wake up because, I mean, it was just crazy. And all the, just the floor
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.520]  I had and everything. The people in my family working at the school cafeteria, hearing that
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.640]  the vegetables, a piece of the vegetable. People don't care. These people fold their
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.120]  arms and look at you in disbelief, and they're not gonna wake up until they got a freaking,
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]  I don't even know.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120]  And they got away-
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.280]  Those that don't know, the six-year-old, they said touching is now in tags illegal everywhere.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:14.240]  Pull up articles, children are now arrested for running, Associated Press. And AP is reasonable.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:19.040]  They're like, well, yeah, at recess if you run, you could get hurt. So there could be
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.680]  a terrorist somewhere someday, so we gotta grab your genitals.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.060]  Again, it's this idea that you could run and get hurt, so you're gonna go to jail. Or you
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:31.360]  touch someone, we told you, touching is sexual assault. Yeah, most schools now, shaking hands
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:36.520]  is illegal. It's not illegal, but they still charge you. They just charge you with assault
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.960]  or they charge you with molesting with the touching.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.880]  And meanwhile, the teachers, as you know in the news, are gang raping the children with
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.480]  pleasure. And you say that was going on in your school, just what you saw was the groping
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480]  and the rest of it.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:54.080]  Oh, it's just a pure medication of everybody and everything. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.420]  Now, that's a country that said 51 million babies should die. They weren't humans. We
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.960]  are a mad, crazy society going to hell.

[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:22.560]  All right, let's go back to your calls right now. Brian in California. Brian, you're on
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.800]  the air.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.640]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.640]  Good.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:33.080]  Oh, man, listen, thank you so much for turning me on to the Apple Seed Project. I heard the
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.400]  guy on your show about two years ago, and I recently took the course. I would encourage
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.720]  all your listeners to go and spend a weekend with those wonderful people, man. How-
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.240]  And for those that don't know, it's basic rifleman training.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.480]  Yeah, absolutely. Those founding fathers knew what they were talking about, right? Tom Jefferson,
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.360]  would your rifle be a constant companion on your walks?
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.720]  Yeah, I need to use my rifles more. I used to be an incredible rifleman. I mean, I could
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:04.400]  shoot the top of a Tabasco bottle at 200 yards every time, and now I could shoot bullseye
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.840]  at 200 yards. But I mean, I used to be just an incredible shot because I shot every week,
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.640]  and now I'm just a mediocre. But it should be a constant companion in our lives.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:22.840]  Absolutely. And it also just teaches you discipline, patience, and how to, you know, it's not just
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.280]  about getting the shot off. It's about everything. And of course, at lunchtime, then they tell
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:34.720]  you about the opening stages of 1776 and actually tying it all back to what happened in New
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.080]  Jersey about the ammunition ban. That's what the British were doing. They were raiding
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:44.760]  all of the powder stores. So there you see it again, a little sort of a tie in there,
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.760]  you know?
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.360]  If you read the Declaration of Independence, it's everything the crooks are doing now.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:54.080]  I mean, look, the government has been caught, all eight law enforcement agencies, shipping
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.400]  drugs in. That's in all the federal documents. Fast and Furious on the news, they're covering
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:04.280]  it up. And shipping the guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment. CBS News got the
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.920]  documents. I mean, we already knew that. Obviously, it was to blame the Second Amendment. They
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.400]  used it for that.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.800]  I predicted years ago that was the program going on, because I know these criminals.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.000]  I know them, but now they're caught. And no one gets in trouble, because the government
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.740]  is criminal run. They've gotten away with every crime you can imagine. And lower level
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:27.840]  criminals who aren't as evil, they can't say no to the other criminals, because they're
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.840]  all compromised.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.120]  I mean, do you realize how dangerous that is?
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.400]  A hierarchy of evil, my friend, a hierarchy of evil. Everybody trying to scramble to the
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:41.760]  top. And the controllers at the top, no. So they are the ones holding the strings, holding
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.720]  all of the information, you know, the extortion, the bribery, everything. It's rotten from
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.600]  the bottom up, the top. And they pit us against each other, or they try to pit, they give
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.880]  us the false choices, they try to pit us against each other. And that's the thing about, again,
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:04.160]  coming back to Appleseed, empowering the individual, spreading the community. You know, the Founding
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.440]  Fathers were also pacifists.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.560]  They waited to be shot at first, and that's what we need to do. You know, we need to be
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:17.160]  the individual, the pacifists, constantly promoting peace, peace, peace in this world.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:23.480]  Promoting peace 24-7 and exhausting every avenue, but preparing for defense. And if
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.840]  the defense stops, not backing off.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.480]  Right on, and listen, there was one other thing I wanted to ask you. Lindsey Williams
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:38.120]  was on your show about maybe a year ago, right? And he was talking about meeting some, I don't
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:47.520]  know, Arizona Congresswoman who had a meeting with Mr. Napolitano. And she told her to have
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.360]  enough food and water for six months.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.000]  Yeah, I figured out who it is and asked him off air and he said, Alex, please don't tell
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.640]  anyone. Yes, that's who I talked with. But please, it was in confidence. But yeah, you
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.560]  can figure out who it is real quick. But every cop I know, everybody's told it's total collapse
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.560]  coming.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.920]  The globalists are acting like, gee, the derivatives and all this, we didn't know. Now we have
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.200]  to use Homeland Security on you. It was always set up for us, as I said on 9-11, as I said
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:21.480]  years before, because of the Rand Corporation. I've got more of their documents today I was
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.480]  reading.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:28.120]  They're talking about false flags, like we're idiots. I've got a bunch of different institutes
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:33.680]  talking about false flags in front of us, brother, like we don't see. Gary Hart sends
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:39.240]  letter to Akhmet Denizheen saying, we'll stage terror attacks. And we are changed questioning.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:45.200]  It's in my film, Truth Rising. They confront him and they go, you sent a letter saying
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.200]  we'd stage attacks.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.080]  He goes, no, I didn't write that letter. You don't have a copy of that. And they go, here
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.920]  it is. He goes, I did write that letter, yes. And he suddenly starts sweating like they
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:59.400]  can see. They're so used to everybody being ignorant and spiritually and culturally and
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:05.720]  gut-blind that when they actually know you can see them, they're scared.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.200]  And that's the thing. Globalist 15 years ago when I would confront them were arrogant.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.520]  They are scared to death. I saw Kirk Watson inside a radio studio last year. I was there
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:20.480]  doing an interview and he was there after me. I was leaving. And he saw me and he was
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.600]  there with a bunch of other state senators. And he went up against the wall and was like,
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.840]  Alex Jones, hi, hi, let's be friends.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:32.360]  I was trying to shake my hand and I just walked past him. But I mean, it's like, you have
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:39.760]  to understand that these evil people, we are like 8,000 foot platinum warriors with huge
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:48.560]  swords and battle axes. They're like little rat-covered, skeksy demons creeping around.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.240]  They're maggots.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:56.680]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:04.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.440]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.600]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.980]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:21.540]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:27.960]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:32.280]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:36.400]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:43.760]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:54.920]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:31:00.680]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:19.320]  globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:24.480]  the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.160]  documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:33.640]  shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:39.640]  fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship. Body scanners,
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:45.240]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:50.400]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's

[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:34.120]  Through my arteries, through my jugglers, through my carotid, through my aorta, my heart's
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:42.400]  big and red and beating hard because I'm a live wire. Here's the best part right here,
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:50.600]  crank it up. Come on baby, take a chance with me. I'm your live wire. Listen, the globalists
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:57.600]  have us in a trance. All you got to do is wake up and be alive. If you're alive, you'd
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.480]  see what's happening. If you were alive, they couldn't have you under mind control. Just
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:10.480]  start looking around you, start researching. It is so important to do that. The good part's
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:17.480]  coming here in a minute. Better set me free. A little bit better than I used to be. I'm
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:24.480]  a live wire. You're all live wires. The globalists are scared of you. These little chicken scum
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.480]  had to poison your food, your water, your air, your culture, in an attempt to dumb you
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:34.480]  down so they could control you. This is a message of the New World Order. Crank it up,
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:41.480]  run free. I'm a live wire. You're all live wires. The globalists are scared of you. These
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:49.160]  little chicken scum had to poison your food, your water, your air, your culture in an attempt
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:55.440]  to dumb you down so they could control you. This is a message of the New World Order.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:02.440]  Crank it up, right here. Come on, baby. I'm your live wire. I'm everything the New World
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:13.920]  Order fears. And you know you are what they fear as well. So activate, wake up, and get
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:20.920]  involved. All right, that's enough. That's a live wire. You know who? Because I'm alive.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:27.920]  Because I'm alive. I am alive. I am conscious. The Illuminati call it being eliminated, but
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:42.740]  that's their devilish counterfeit. It's normal to be awake. It's normal to be alive in a
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:48.360]  healthy culture. And then we look at those who are stunted and small minded and take
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.920]  care of them as children. When Christ talked about suffer the little ones.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.160]  That's not just the children in that beautiful poetry. Better to tie a millstone around your
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:03.320]  neck and throw yourself into the deepest sea than to harm one of these. A millstone, they'd
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:09.760]  have the donkey or the person. You'd push it around and grind the grain so you can make
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:18.880]  the bread, grind the wheat, grind it down, could weigh tons.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:25.280]  Better to tie that around your neck and jump into the ocean than to hurt a simple person,
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:31.880]  to hurt an old lady, to hurt a child, to use someone's lack of knowledge to feed on them
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:38.880]  and abuse them and suck off of them. Better that you kill yourself than do that because
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.380]  God hates you.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.260]  Vengeance belongs to God. But I will tell you here, I am here to defend against evil
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:54.260]  and I'm here to wake people up. And as humans, we are instruments of justice. And when you're
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:37:00.420]  doing right and when you're on the side of good, who can stop you? If they kill you,
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.900]  you become a martyr.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:06.320]  If they don't, you march forward against the enemy. If they kill your name, show what the
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:13.320]  information's already gone out. You are the answer to the New World Order. You are the
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:21.580]  answer to 1984. You are 1776. If you're listening to my voice, you are the resistance. You get
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:29.900]  how real this is, how exciting that is?
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:34.980]  How hardcore reality is that a great contest between the forces of good and evil is always
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:41.080]  taking place around you. But a great contest, a great crossroads, a great time when the
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:48.080]  future of our species destiny is being decided. When our course is the object of the great
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:55.080]  contest, is the object of the great contest. To stand here now, with you, truth is stranger
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.600]  than fiction.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:11.600]  Make the right choice, you're only alive once. Choose wisely. Don't sit on the fence. Don't
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  be lukewarm. If you're going to serve evil, then serve it with all your heart, all your
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:26.480]  mind, all your soul. And if you're going to serve good, realize that good is not some
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.720]  limp-wristed, weak, groveling thing.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:37.720]  Good is fiery and shatters mountains. Good is the documented cases of a woman picking
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:44.720]  up a giant, there were cases of this in the 50s and 60s, giant Cadillac off of their child
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:52.720]  as they squeal underneath the axle. The cases are well documented where the woman sees the
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.760]  small child screaming, sees the blood, and the woman turns off their governor.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.160]  Their psychological block that's there so we don't hurt ourselves and others, and lifts
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:09.160]  that car off that child on record. Our potential mentally, spiritually, physically is unbelievable.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.320]  That's why the globalist are scared. They have this knowledge but are evil and have
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:25.320]  sought to hoard it for themselves.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  I am not illuminated with their Luciferian garbage because illumination is only partial
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:38.600]  knowledge. It's a lie. They think they know the secrets of the universe. They think they
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:43.120]  know, but they're damned. They're cut off because of their own choices. They're given
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.920]  a great delusion. They have physical knowledge how to manipulate people, and they know others
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:55.440]  are unconscious. But they themselves have not broken the surface of the water.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:02.440]  They are not seeing clearly. They have not breached. They are not truly conscious. Because
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:10.040]  if you're truly conscious, then you don't think there's a God. You know there's a God.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:15.100]  And you can't put it in a book. You can't even get a sermon about it to understand it.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:22.100]  One cannot be told about the matrix. One must see it. It's the metaphor we see in films
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:30.400]  like They Live. You're gonna put these sunglasses on, but the guy still had to make the choice.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.920]  Put these sunglasses on or start eating concrete. The truth is you're already eating concrete
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:40.080]  because you won't put the sunglasses on. You don't need to believe what Alex Jones believes
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:47.080]  cuz I don't believe Jack Diddley squat. I see, I know. And once you are awake, it's
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.520]  ridiculous how easy it is to be awake.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:58.140]  You can't believe how weak the global star. You can't believe that if the mass of us began
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:05.140]  to awake, we would throw this little one inch parasite off of our back like we were brushing
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:12.140]  off some diseased beetle. But I warn you, the system knows that and is racing with our
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:20.100]  money, our ingenuity, our science, our energy to build giant armies of drones, ground robots.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.900]  Most of the cars are gonna be remote control, already multi-states of 18-wheelers that are
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:29.340]  driverless. We're being dehumanized. We're having the whole system taken away from us
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:36.060]  as if we don't have a choice and as if we're not involved in anything.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:39.740]  Now I'm gonna give you some financial news, but first I wanna illustrate what they do
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:43.900]  here. And if you're not watching at prisonplanet.tv or the free video stream at infowars.com, that's
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:50.020]  fine. You're listening on the radio now on XM, AM, FM. We'll archive this report probably
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.020]  tomorrow or so with an article by Kurt Nemo.
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:56.540]  If not, it'll be Friday cuz I know McBreen's working on another piece. All together with
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:01.020]  the man on the street on aspartame, just one chemical weapon they're using against us that
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:06.820]  of course Bill Gates is involved in now, owning part of Monsanto. Rumsfeld got it passed.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:12.300]  It was a Department of Defense weapon, weaponized bacteria that defecates a chemical weapon
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:16.380]  that's highly addictive. A lot of poisons are addictive. You can look it all up yourself.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:23.380]  I know this sounds insane. Just look up manufacturing process aspartame. And it's got ads from 1981
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:29.020]  when it rolled out. I remember being about six, seven years old, and all my neighbors
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:34.380]  and myself getting in the mail, the gumballs, a big package of gumballs that were nutra
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.380]  sweet.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:39.900]  I remember eating it and thinking it tasted bad and it giving me a headache. I knew the
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:43.340]  Dallas water, you can almost light on fire. It's got so many chemicals on it, gave me
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:47.900]  a headache as a child. And I just learned, well, I've been out playing soccer or baseball
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:52.580]  or football. I'm gonna drink the water, I'm gonna get the headache. I'm gonna brush my
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:53.860]  teeth, I'm gonna get the headache.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.460]  They come to school with the fluoride pills, I'm gonna get my headache. I didn't know what
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:05.460]  fluoride was doing to me, I was experiencing it. But the point here is that Fred Flintstone
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:17.940]  adds about how great cigarettes are. Ads for women about how sexy it is to have cigarettes,
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:24.780]  and they even psych warfare chief, nephew of Sigmund Freud, who worked for the Pentagon,
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:28.380]  even wrote how they sold women that it was feminist and cool to smoke cigarettes knowing
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.440]  it would kill them.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:36.440]  And sold the fake rebellion factor, and of course was the author of the book Propaganda.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:46.640]  But the point is, they called it liberty torches for women. Edward Bernays put out that term,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.820]  show the men, smoke your cigarette. Four women dipped powdered snuff behind closed doors
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:59.820]  and snorted it. But he's the reason we eat bacon and eggs. They couldn't really sell
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:03.220]  the pork bellies, it was only used for food flavoring and stews and things.
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:07.460]  So they had a national thing about gotta have bacon with your eggs and gotta have them the
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:12.180]  music room. Just a lot of PR things to sell products, but he also worked for the Department
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:16.980]  of War. And they sold programs, we'll put some of these graphics up before we go to
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:23.600]  the video, of big full color spreads in magazines about doctor recommended camel.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.660]  It's so good, you'd walk a mile, got a sore throat, smoke some extra camels, they'll set
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:35.020]  you right. The majority of doctors think Kent is the best, and it's film footage and newscast
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:41.060]  and film reels and ads. So many of these online were the doctors smoking the cigarette and
[01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:45.620]  it's the thing to do. And Fred Flintstone's smoking the Winston, they're so delicious,
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.280]  they've got the flavor you demand.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:56.660]  It's so good for you, you're so beautiful when you do it. Mommy, enjoy your Marlboro,
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:01.740]  it's so great, mommy. Selling how great your children love the cigarettes and the doctor
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:08.380]  recommends you need your cigarettes. More doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette.
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:12.340]  I wanted to show you this so when you hear about, doctors say fluoride's good in your
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:18.220]  water. Really, the sodium fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals they add under that name?
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:23.500]  Doctors say Prozac's good, doctors say there's no mercury in shots. Remember that lie 10
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:26.820]  years ago and then we pointed out, look at the insert, it says, they're like, well, it's
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.260]  in there, but it's good for you.
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:32.380]  It's good for your brain. Do I need to play the newscast again? Mercury is good for your
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:36.860]  brain. Most deadly heavy metal in the brain keeps eating through it and other heavy metals
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:41.380]  just cause plaques. It keeps killing and killing and killing and killing, causes electrochemical
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:46.860]  death in the neurons, but they say it's good for you.
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:53.900]  Now, let's play the commercial where the doctor says it's so good for you and Fred Flintstone
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:59.340]  likes it as well. And then it segues with all these happy families and old men sitting
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:03.820]  out front the old fashioned gas station. It's all meant to be nostalgic for the 50s.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:11.660]  It's all stylized like a Norman Rockwell painting. This came out in the 80, 81, but it's all
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:16.880]  stylized like you're in the 50s, playing nostalgia, hitting the trigger that this is old fashioned,
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.880]  this is good.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:23.380]  And then adds about, it's got everything that's in a bowl of milk and cereal and bananas.
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:28.700]  It's healthy, it's not really natural, but it comes from things that are natural. Never
[01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:34.620]  telling you it's bacteria feces, Department of Defense weapon program. I mean, this is
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.980]  all imagined.
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:41.740]  They're showing kids eating it, saying it's good, comparing it to bananas, knowing it's
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:45.020]  a Department of Defense chemical weapon. Here it is.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:50.880]  Let's take a Winston break. That's it. Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.180]  flavor 20 times a pack. Winston's got that filter Flint.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:47:01.500]  The Flintstones have been brought to you by Winston, America's best selling, best tasting
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.500]  filter cigarette.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.060]  Winston tastes good like a-
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.060]  Cartoons for the kids.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.060]  Cigarette good.
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:14.620]  Oh, look, Bedrock's happy. They all got Winston.
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:20.580]  In a repeated national survey, doctors in all branches of medicine, doctors in all parts
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:26.380]  of the country were asked, what cigarette do you smoke, doctor? Once again, the brand
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:33.060]  named most was Camel. Yes, according to this repeated nationwide survey, more doctors smoke
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:39.780]  Camels than any other cigarette. Why not change to Camels for the next 30 days and see what
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:45.660]  a difference it makes in your smoking enjoyment. See how Camels agree with your throat. See
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:49.860]  how mild and good tasting a cigarette can be.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:53.660]  Last year, over 2 million people got something of a surprise.
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:56.660]  Oh, last year, 2 million people got gumballs in the mail.
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:01.660]  Their first taste of NutraSweet. And of all things, they're not going to love you.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:02.660]  Oh, a gumdrop.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:08.660]  What's NutraSweet? It's a sweeting ingredient that isn't fattening.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.660]  And for some reason, we played this last night and it had better audio.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:15.660]  It is not official life cycle. Isn't that beautiful?
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.660]  And he goes on to say how great it is and how it takes good care of you.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.660]  It sounds just as good to be true.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:25.660]  Oh, it's so good to be true.
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:30.660]  Neither do cows, but they might as well. If you've had bananas and-
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:32.660]  Pause right there and back that up.
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:33.660]  It's made from-
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:38.660]  These ads are so old, the first one where it's nostalgic, everybody's getting the gumballs
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:43.660]  in the mail and trying it and enjoying it. Next, it cuts to an ad from the same year
[01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:46.660]  that's got a little bit better audio. Back that up where it's like,
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:51.660]  it doesn't come from a cow, but it could. It doesn't come from bananas.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.660]  It's not natural, but it comes from nature.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:58.660]  Well, yeah, it's a genetically engineered bacteria, the first ever engineered,
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:01.660]  that was meant to eat toxic waste by the Pentagon. I mean, look it up.
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:06.660]  But this is showing parents, their kid, oh, it's healthy like milk.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.660]  Go ahead and go back to it. Here it is.
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:14.660]  NutraSweet. Neither do cows, but they might as well. If you've had bananas and milk,
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:18.660]  you've eaten what's in NutraSweet. It's made from things like those found naturally
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:22.660]  and good things to eat, like two building blocks of protein.
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:28.660]  Nature doesn't make NutraSweet, but NutraSweet couldn't be made without it.
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:33.660]  NutraSweet brand sweetener. Just look for the swirl.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:40.660]  Oh, it's nature. Everybody's happy. Nature doesn't make it, but it could.
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:44.660]  It could. Oh, why don't you tell us how you make it?
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.660]  You're showing us cows and little kids making mixed cereals of milk
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:52.660]  and eating bananas and a toucan and a tree. Everything's healthy.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:56.660]  Why don't you tell us where it came from? Why don't you just show us the big factories?
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:59.660]  I've seen video of it. We ought to show people that again.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:04.660]  Big giant black slur of all these bacteria that they feed different types of toxic waste.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:10.660]  It's bizarre. And then they release a poison that's highly addictive.
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:16.660]  Why don't you show that? Oh, no, we're not going to show people that.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.660]  And of course, going back to the doctors saying they love cigarettes,
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:22.660]  that was also part of the hype to get doctors to not speak out against cigarettes.
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:27.660]  So doctors smoking cigarettes would feel good about it, but also feel like they were being honored.
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:32.660]  Oh, I'm being honored. I'm being invited to the ball. I'm part of the ad.
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:35.660]  Edward Bernays said about 100 years ago, he started this.
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:39.660]  We'll have big balls and we'll put them on the newsreels and radio
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:45.660]  and we'll have the government people there with the Hollywood stuff that just begun
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:49.660]  and we'll make government look like it's a pageant
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:54.660]  and everyone will sign on to our ideas just because we invite them to the party.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:59.660]  They're killing you on purpose. Get that straight. We'll be back.

[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:46.660]  have already seen in the last four months.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.660]  Prepared now.

[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.660]  Okay, we're going to start the next hour soon.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:31.660]  It'll be nothing but your calls until I get to everybody that's been holding
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:34.660]  and then more news, then more calls for Terry,
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:36.660]  Tara, Gator, Carl, Leon.
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.660]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:40.660]  I promised to get to some financial news here,
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.660]  but listen to me, folks.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:44.660]  The eugenics is what runs it all.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.660]  Everything else is a tentacle.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.660]  Okay?
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:48.660]  You understand that?
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:49.660]  You understand everything.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.660]  You understand how they operate?
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:52.660]  You got them.
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.660]  Again, we have the highest cancer rates,
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:58.660]  every other disease, and I mean, it's way above every other country.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:02.660]  And as other countries adopt what we do, it goes off the charts.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:03.660]  Okay?
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:05.660]  And the globalists say they're killing us and they enjoy it
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.660]  and they suck the money out of us as they do it.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.660]  It's very, very simple.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:13.660]  And you wake up to that, all the other stuff's window dressing.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.660]  S&P warns of cuts, another US downgrade coming.
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:22.660]  Pay the bankers higher interest, even though we gave them the money.
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:25.660]  Again, you can't make up the level of the fraud.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.660]  Because the globalists have learned, like Hitler said,
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:28.660]  the bigger the lie, the better.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:29.660]  The bigger the fraud, the better.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.660]  Make it so outlandish.
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.660]  House prices hit post bubble low.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:36.660]  I thought it was a big recovery.
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:37.660]  Of course, the government knows it's a depression.
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:39.660]  They engineered it.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:43.660]  Latest congressional budget outlook for 2012, 2022.
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:45.660]  Well over 10% unemployment.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:51.660]  Got numbers here about Obama's policies increased national debt 47%.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:56.660]  The 21.7 trillion CNS news doing a good job bringing us down.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:57.660]  He's not screwing up.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.660]  It's his job to sucker you along.
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:04.660]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up obviously to pitch gold at incredibly low prices at
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.660]  you and hope you're saying enough to get it.
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:11.660]  We told you them artificially raising margin calls driving things down was from statistically
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.660]  and historically only a tactic.
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.660]  Look at the 12 year graph.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:16.660]  They do that from time to time.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:19.660]  It goes up and goes down, but always overall up.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:25.660]  Now it's going back up because they've announced QE3 and China and others are buying it.
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:28.660]  Ted, what's the news you've got today on this front?
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.660]  Well, like you say, the S&P story is the big thing today that they're looking to downgrade
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:37.660]  the dollar again or downgrade the US government bonds.
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.660]  You know, we're just falling into banana republic status.
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:41.660]  China.
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:47.660]  Here's an article out of Al Jazeera and it just says China is shifting some of its massive
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:53.660]  foreign holdings into gold away from US dollar, undermining the dollar's role as the world's
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:57.660]  reserve currency according to the recent release of WikiLeaks.
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:00.660]  So it's coming out of Wiki, but it's still true.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:01.660]  This is what China is doing.
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:09.660]  We have China sitting in the sixth largest holder of gold and their population obviously
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.660]  is much greater than that.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:12.660]  They can take on quite a bit more.
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:14.660]  So that's going on.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:22.660]  The MF Global thing is the guy Michael Roseman is going to be in front of Congress talking
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.660]  about the MF Global crises.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.660]  The European.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:30.660]  Porzine got caught perjuring himself saying he didn't know where the money went and now
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:34.660]  they just say it's evaporated or vaporized is the word.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:36.660]  Yeah, vaporized.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:40.660]  I mean, obviously a lot of debt and a lot of default and too much leverage and it's
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:43.660]  just the whole thing is such a mess.
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:48.660]  And then that's being driven by Europe and here you have China getting away from the
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:50.660]  United States currency.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:52.660]  Obviously, gold is going to go up in price.
[01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:55.660]  Right now the US dollar's down at 78.78.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:57.660]  Gold right now is up.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:01.660]  It's seen its high today of 1751.70.
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:07.660]  Just to be clear too briefly, Ted, if people call Midas Resources and ask for a whole list
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:15.660]  of the Radio Alex Jones specials on silver, gold, maple leaves, buffaloes, Krugerands,
[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:18.660]  American eagles, British sovereigns.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.660]  There's a whole bunch of specials right now and you can get a free book and a free video
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:27.660]  with the two silver dollars that's at cost to ask about that special.
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:32.660]  You can simply call 800-686-2237.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.660]  800-686-2237.

[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:11.660]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:15.660]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:21.660]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.

[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:59.660]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:06.660]  Big brother.
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.660]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:10.660]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:11.660]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:13.660]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:33.660]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:36.660]  All right, we're going to do five more minutes with Ted Anderson, go to break, and go right
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:37.660]  to your calls.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.660]  I promise I'll control myself.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.660]  I want to hear from you.
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:42.660]  We got a bunch of other news that I got to get into when I ran.
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:46.660]  They got a big think tank saying, yeah, false flags will help us.
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:48.660]  We got the latest on Bill Gates.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:49.660]  That's all coming up.
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:53.660]  But right now, going back to Ted, I mean, Ted, look, the system has engineered a depression
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:56.660]  to create more of a managed economy, just like the Great Depression.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:59.660]  But this is going to be a lot bigger, obviously.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:03.660]  Home ownership rates have fallen 66% as downturn nears.
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:10.660]  But the reports are that the Chinese government, not just the people, are buying gold as fast
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.660]  as they can.
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:16.660]  Venezuela has announced irrevocable withdrawal from World Bank Arbitration body.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:22.540]  Venezuela, of course, has demanded its gold back out of British banks, and it's now placed
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:26.140]  itself directly in line of fire with globalist elites.
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:29.700]  That's out of Venezuela analysis by Ewan Robertson.
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:34.580]  We've got a Sicily's pitchfork movement in revolt, open revolt in areas of Italy, but
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.140]  nobody's covering that here on our media.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:42.980]  I mean, at Davos, Ted, the elites admitted that global government's failing.
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:46.420]  That was what they had up on the big screen, and that they're concerned.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:47.620]  They should be concerned, Ted.
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.700]  They've been so good at robbing everything.
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:52.940]  They haven't been too good, though, at covering up that they're the ones doing it, Ted.
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:55.620]  No, they haven't been, as a matter of fact.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:59.380]  And like you say, they're losing control.
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:01.660]  They're doing everything they can to destroy the currency.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:05.740]  We'll probably be falling into a new currency, a world currency.
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:10.820]  But David Malpass is writing right now that the Fed's actions will kill the US dollar.
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:14.700]  And of course, he's referring to the Fed's policy to keep the interest rates low all
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:16.220]  the way to the year 2014.
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:20.540]  I mean, you've got to realize that's quantitative easing three, even though they're not saying
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:21.540]  it.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:22.540]  It's happening.
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:24.720]  And that's going to drive gold prices up.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:26.900]  Gold has been money for 6,000 years.
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.900]  So has silver.
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:31.920]  People have been trading gold and silver as money, and that's why it holds value.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:36.100]  When you see gold and silver rising, that is a bellwether to the fact that the United
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:37.460]  States dollar is dropping.
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:42.180]  It's hard to follow the dollar indexes and actually get a take on what's going on because
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:45.280]  the currencies that they're measuring against are falling, too.
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.700]  So you have to turn to commodities to get that.
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:48.820]  You can look at oil.
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:50.060]  You can look at other things.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:52.180]  But one of the best things to look at is gold.
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:54.460]  And Alex, you're talking about gold and silver.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:58.300]  Personally, I think that people just, they should not be without this.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:01.580]  We have survival bags of dimes on the website.
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.040]  You can call us for them.
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:08.180]  But that is small pieces of silver that can be used as money no matter what happens.
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:12.020]  From what I can tell, for everything that I've been reading, the United States dollar
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:13.260]  is in trouble.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:17.060]  And if you're sitting here thinking that you're going to be able to have stocks, bonds, mutual
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:21.980]  funds, even money in government securities like treasury bonds, notes, bills, that type
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:26.080]  of thing, the inflation tax is just going to eat it away.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.780]  That's what they're going for right now.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:31.980]  The Fed is printing money to try to keep the economy going.
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:37.140]  And S&P is even coming out now and saying that the United States bonds are in trouble
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:38.700]  and you better do something different.
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:40.860]  And that's why you see China getting out of it.
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:44.800]  And of course, you're going to see all these countries that are obviously not favorable
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:46.700]  to the United States to start with.
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:47.860]  They don't want to be involved with that.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:48.860]  I'm not saying that.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:54.100]  And you're going to see total demonization of gold because it's what exposes the fact
[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:55.860]  that the currencies are all being devalued.
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:59.500]  And we're not saying gold and silver are silver bullets, but it's as close as you're going
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.860]  to get in my experience, in my personal life.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:07.140]  I bought gold at 300 bucks an ounce, silver at five, never sold it at its high, didn't
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:10.100]  sell it when it went down a little, didn't sell it when it goes back up.
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:13.580]  It's an emergency backup, but I don't have much, but it's something.
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:16.900]  And Ted's got a bunch of special deals running right now, call, they've got whatever you're
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:17.900]  looking for.
[02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:21.380]  They got a big selection because Ted buys big during the dips because he's confident
[02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:22.940]  that it's going to go back up.
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:27.380]  He sells you the lower price, gold and silver, when the price goes up, he doesn't raise the
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.380]  price.
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:31.020]  That's how he's become the fifth largest gold and silver broker in the United States.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:35.020]  Here's the Midas number, 800-686-2237.
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:39.380]  Give them a call today, ask the brokers any questions you've got, ask them about specials
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:43.880]  on books and videos as well, 800-686-2237.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:47.380]  They're almost out of that Big Brother book, so when that's gone, that'll be it for the
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:51.180]  free video, free book, and the two silver dollars and the free shipping.
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:54.460]  You just buy the silver dollars, you get free shipping, free book and video, it's an incredible
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:55.460]  deal.
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:56.460]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:57.460]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:00.860]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:05.520]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.860]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:14.180]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.500]  allows you to have.
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:21.160]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.500]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.500]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:32.980]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:36.700]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:41.260]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:45.220]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.600]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:52.500]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:59.660]  Remember the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:02.240]  Hi, folks.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:03.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:08.100]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:09.100]  risk.
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:10.240]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:14.860]  The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:19.980]  real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:25.820]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:27.400]  or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:33.020]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.300]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:38.620]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.680]  to do something you've never done before.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:48.580]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.820]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:13.180]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:14.180]  at home.
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:19.200]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:20.200]  the shots.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:25.020]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:30.640]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.340]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:37.740]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:41.740]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:47.700]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:48.700]  of the Republic.
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:55.660]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:08:02.180]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:22.540]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls, and then Issa threatens Holder with contempt
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:27.060]  over the false flag terror attack that the Criminal Justice Department launched against
[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:31.660]  Mexico and the U.S. to blame the Second Amendment by shoving the armaments into the country,
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:36.100]  and blame our basic freedoms because they are Constitution-hating terrorists.
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:41.860]  Smart meters for energy to be voluntary, but then you actually read deeper, it's basically
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:42.860]  mandatory.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:46.060]  Pythons are squeezing the life out of the Everglades, scientists war, I'm gonna break
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:47.860]  that down.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:51.780]  Obama on drones, a lot more, but right, I got a bunch of breaking news.
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:55.620]  And the U.S. nuke sub heads towards Persian Gulf, that's breaking.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:09:00.220]  Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com, that's just some of what's coming up.
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:04.420]  Right now, Trey in South Carolina, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:07.100]  Hey, Alex, called about a year ago.
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:12.760]  I think I asked how you dealt with the burden of all the knowledge, and you gave me a pretty
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.760]  good answer.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:19.980]  And since then, well, I've been awake quite a long time, but I really don't watch too
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:24.300]  much cable TV, and if I do, it's the History Channel, stuff like that.
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:31.100]  But even in things like that, you can see how biased everything is, and you can see
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:32.100]  the conditioning.
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:36.460]  I mean, the conditioning's everywhere, it's not just in news, it's in TV.
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:42.860]  Once you're awake, it is so wild to see the bombardment and the brainwashing, and then
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:48.260]  to see adults with this satisfied little smirk they get when they're in make believe.
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:52.180]  They're in a trance, literally, this is what the psych warfare chiefs say, and they're
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:55.860]  in make believe about their role.
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:10:02.300]  And they've got all these little niches and subgroups that people have these false identities.
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:05.940]  And they did the studies 100 years ago where you put a hunting cap on somebody, people
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:06.980]  act like a hunter.
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:11.100]  You put a wild native outfit on, you jump around and say, ooga booga.
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:14.640]  You dress a woman up in a sexy outfit, she feels sexual.
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:18.380]  You dress guys up in black uniforms, they feel menacing and powerful.
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:19.380]  And they're little kids.
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:24.780]  I mean, I've been in New York and other places, and they'll have cops with big machine guns,
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.380]  giant body armor.
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:31.460]  And you see the photos of them online, and they're just like, and they sit there bearing
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:33.700]  their teeth and acting tough.
[02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:37.660]  And actually, people walk by scared of them, and you see the cops actually feeding on it.
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:42.060]  And it's like a five-year-old dressing up like a superhero, running up when my son was
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:45.080]  five and acting like he was scaring me and I'd play along.
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.040]  They literally are children.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.300]  They are children in a mind control system.
[02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:52.400]  I mean, they are so sad.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:53.540]  That's why I used to get mad at them.
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:56.820]  I realized these are damaged people.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:02.340]  And the general public are literally just childlike, arrested development, brain damaged
[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:03.340]  people.
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:05.340]  I mean, we are under zombie control.
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:06.660]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:11.620]  Yeah, I mean, the whole system is just so big.
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:14.260]  And to wake other people up, I mean, I've got two little sisters.
[02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:18.340]  One's in grade school and the other one's, she's in sixth grade.
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:20.340]  And I worry about them.
[02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:23.180]  That's why I wanna get them young.
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:27.540]  If you teach children about manipulation early on, they become genius at it.
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:28.540]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:30.260]  The system, this is key, what I'm about to tell you.
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:31.260]  Listen very carefully.
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:35.700]  This is very important, something I don't say enough or may have never even said.
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:42.380]  The globalists get their power out of massaging and manipulating hoaxes and trends that then
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:46.100]  get picked up by the general public and acted upon.
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:52.140]  And it's the mass of billions giving their power to it and playing along is what makes
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:54.980]  it go system wide and be so huge.
[02:11:54.980 --> 02:12:01.540]  Because we all start unconsciously repeating it, like saying, we're attacking Iraq.
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:05.960]  We're attacking Afghanistan, the superpower.
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.960]  We're not a superpower.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.940]  We're a military province, debilitated, destroyed, none of our infrastructure fixed, falling
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:18.660]  apart by offshore mega banks who let us take the blame for all the crimes they're committing.
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:20.460]  There's just levels to this.
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:24.100]  And so I always say, we shouldn't be in Iraq.
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:27.340]  We're not in Iraq, we're hijacked.
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:31.100]  That's like if a guy hijacks your plane, it's like we're hijackers.
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:34.740]  No, we're on a plane that's hijacked.
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:40.340]  So as we unlock people's minds and they start seeing that power paradigm starts heating
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:41.780]  up like a dynamo.
[02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:47.800]  And that's what scares the globalist because a zombie repeating mind control gives some
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:51.260]  power to the system and in mass it's very powerful.
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:54.000]  And it creates a feedback loop echo chamber.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.040]  But as people actually activate and become conscious, literally wake up out of the matrix.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:00.380]  It's not an electronic matrix.
[02:13:00.380 --> 02:13:03.060]  They're trying to build that and insert us into it with the electronics and the rest
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:04.060]  of it.
[02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:09.860]  But it's a false habitat and a false understandings that we add power to.
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:15.620]  As people wake up out of that and go, whoa, then it adds incredible power to accelerate
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.780]  the awakening.
[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:18.900]  That's why they're trying to head us off at the pass.
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:23.380]  They are, look, the New World Order inside their New World Order system literally has
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:30.620]  alert, alert, critical mind control system breaking.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.940]  We have failures at multiple levels.
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:37.940]  I mean, they are freaks, Brzezinski, Hillary, all of them, their own groups are like info
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:38.940]  war.
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:39.940]  We're losing it.
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:40.940]  They're waking up.
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:41.940]  Get a war going.
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:42.940]  Add more chemicals in the water.
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:43.940]  Get it going.
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:46.020]  I mean, they are not invincible.
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:47.020]  Go ahead.
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:54.300]  Also, back when Ron Paul was campaigning here in South Carolina, I made it an effort the
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:14:00.340]  weekend before the primary to go out into the downtown area and pass out Ron Paul pamphlets
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:01.460]  and information.
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:08.820]  Well, I came across one guy and he was a former, he's a vet, and I had asked him what he thought
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:12.020]  about Ron Paul and he said, I love everything about Ron Paul.
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:16.580]  The only thing I do not like and the only reason I'm not voting for him, oh, mind you,
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:21.020]  he's voting for Rick Santorum, but I don't like his foreign policy.
[02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:26.580]  And I said, okay, so what you're telling me is you want the way it is now.
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:34.780]  And he says, no, I want other countries to know who's got the big guns or who's, he didn't
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:35.780]  word it like that.
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:36.780]  But he said-
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.660]  No, no, he personally feels powerful through the New World Order system.
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:45.660]  He, I mean, these guys, these cops, all of them that I talked to who aren't awake, they
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:51.900]  have pride in it when this is a system that hates them more than the Iraqis.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:57.140]  And that's the worst part because whenever you try to tell them, like I had brought it
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:02.940]  up to him and I've said New World Order and he kind of like, what are you talking about?
[02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:06.780]  I know you're not talking about the wrestling and I was like, no, no, of course not.
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:07.780]  This is government.
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:10.500]  This is a serious, serious, serious thing.
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:13.660]  And I didn't even want to try to get into it with him because you could tell the-
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:18.780]  Sir, if he thinks the New World Order is Hulk Hogan, which they did on purpose, of course,
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:22.700]  is part of the blurring everything, I mean, you need to move on.
[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:24.740]  You're not going to be able to help him right now.
[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:26.660]  I mean, look, look, look, that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:29.780]  They buy into their, their own identity is in the system.
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:34.260]  And I mean, guys like that hear this show and that they're being poisoned on purpose.
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:39.100]  It doesn't matter if I have so many documents and books published by The Globalist, they're
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:40.860]  not going to listen.
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:42.860]  And you know, that guy's kid could die of cancer.
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:46.220]  He's not going to listen because he's not going to admit somebody killed his kid.
[02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:50.900]  Then he'd have to do something about it, see, and he's not going to do that.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:54.940]  He's going to go bury his kid and everybody's going to cry at the funeral and that's it.
[02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:59.180]  I mean, the guys, look, they are spiritually weak.
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:02.660]  They are psychologically weak and all you can try to do is plant a seed.
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:05.860]  I would move on to those that are already partially awake.
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:11.480]  I mean, you let the dead bury the dead, knock the dust off your feet, no pearls before swine.
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:14.280]  Try to give somebody the knowledge in a loving way.
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:15.280]  They're under zombie control.
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:20.340]  Just say, I'm praying for you, and a lot of times if you try to convince them nicely,
[02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:25.960]  they get a power trip like you're trying to sell them and ha ha ha, they're aware of that.
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:28.420]  Just say, you know what, pal, enjoy yourself.
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:29.540]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:33.180]  Yeah, you're not going to, I mean, people like that.
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:39.700]  I mean, that's one of the big control systems is when they think it's their military and
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:44.420]  their country and that everybody's, they know I'm big.
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:49.340]  Yes, they know you're very big, that they use you for a guinea pig.
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:52.260]  They're training paramilitary to kill the veterans.
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:57.820]  They hate your guts and constantly talk about how you're the enemy and the number one threat.
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:02.700]  But see, he's the type who'll go along with the system.
[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:07.380]  He's that 30% or so that'll serve up evil, cuz they're the good guys.
[02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:09.300]  Say, well, I'm a good guy, so I torture.
[02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:12.020]  Well, I'm a good guy, so I do this and that.
[02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:15.180]  Carol in Oregon, you're on the air and then Leon and others.
[02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:16.180]  Go ahead, Carol.
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:17.740]  Yeah, Carl from Oregon.
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.740]  Carl, sorry, brother.
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:19.740]  Oh, that's all right.
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:25.740]  I just have to apologize that I call in so much recently, but I don't want to take up
[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:26.740]  too much time.
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.980]  Sir, I don't even know when you did call in, but go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:29.980]  We don't screen your calls.
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:30.980]  You're just on air.
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:31.980]  Very good.
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:33.780]  People always call on the show and want me to screen their call.
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:35.780]  I mean, you're on.
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.980]  All right, all right.
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:40.500]  My church has been co-opted, I think.
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:44.820]  I go to an Adventist church, and I try to talk to the senior pastors a couple of months
[02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:45.820]  ago.
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.500]  As you know, I called in before, and I told you I left California because of all that's
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:50.500]  going on down there.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:55.220]  Of course, a couple of callers called in, and all the news is going on now, how it's
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:59.300]  becoming a police state down there, that's the reason why I left, but I had a good church
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:03.100]  I went to down there, and they told me to go to an Adventist church.
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:08.460]  That's the best church to go to, because they worship the best in the scripture, they worship
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:12.020]  on the right day, they are into good health and food and nutrition.
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:15.900]  I went to this nice church here, I found a very nice one, but I talked to the senior
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:20.100]  pastor, and I said, hey, what do you think about what's going on in prophecy today?
[02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:25.100]  What's going on, and what do you think of this show that I listened to, your show?
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:29.380]  And he says, oh, brother, they'll drive you crazy.
[02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:30.380]  Don't go there.
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:37.460]  Yeah, well, the Seventh-day Adventist, on average, I've known some are very good, hardworking,
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:43.380]  smart people, and they're supposedly about being healthy, but they never tell you GMO.
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:48.340]  I mean, GMO is a bunch of bacteria and insect genes added, and it's deadly.
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:52.740]  I mean, you might as well be drinking Jack Daniels every day by the gallon, that'd be
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:55.780]  better for you, and they're like, it's fine.
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:01.500]  And yes, the big denominations, I know this, the Seventh-day Adventists are the only group
[02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:04.500]  of test subjects that actually volunteered.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:09.380]  Seventh-day Adventists in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, and it hadn't been declassified
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:16.340]  since, we're only up to the 80s, volunteered to be an experiment, some of which were semi-lethal,
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.700]  killed people.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:22.540]  Cuz the church told their men, go, be part of this Pentagon test.
[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:28.900]  And Seventh-day Adventists, for whatever reason, I mean, it's all the big denominations.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:34.540]  I mean, clergy response teams are over 100,000 covert preachers, are FEMA officers, part
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:39.580]  of Infra Guards, spying on their flocks, telling them submit to tyranny.
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:44.620]  And so he's probably a Infra Guard, or at least clergy response team.
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:49.420]  If it's a big church, I mean, you better believe he's got files on everybody in the church,
[02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:51.420]  and you were reported to Homeland Security.
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:55.540]  Not like it did anything wrong, but they're just getting ready for the arrest and everything.
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:58.140]  So he probably is an outright servant of the New World Order.
[02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:01.380]  I wanna hear more about it when we come back.
[02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:05.500]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:09.780]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:13.740]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off, and placing your child's
[02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:19.220]  name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:23.100]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:28.620]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:31.100]  dependency, your food supply.
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:35.100]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:06.020]  Has the United States been discovered in the Bible?
[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:08.380]  Where does Islam fit in Bible prophecy?
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:11.860]  Is the New World Order world government?

[02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:04.460]  Do you use a CPAP breathing device to help treat sleep apnea and prevent snoring?
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:08.500]  If so, you should know big insurance companies and government regulations can affect the
[02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:10.460]  way you buy sleep apnea equipment.
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:14.540]  They decide what devices you receive, when you get replacement equipment, and even what
[02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:15.540]  you pay.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:17.300]  Why limit the quality of your treatment?
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:22.500]  Break away from institutionalized healthcare and shop where you set the sleep therapy standard.
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:24.260]  Shop at CPAP.com.

[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:07.700]  You know, what I know about Seventh Day Adventists, because I don't get into all these different
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:15.660]  Christian sects and groups and all of them fighting with each other, is that my mother,
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:18.820]  right around the time I was born, went to work, and I always get it confused because
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:23.140]  she went back and forth at the Dallas, the Dallas, was it Dallas Morning News or Dallas
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:24.140]  Times Herald?
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:25.140]  I think it was the Dallas Morning News.
[02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:28.980]  She hates it when I talk about her on air, I bet her not.
[02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:33.780]  And then for a while, because of family friends, she was the main secretary for like one of
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:35.380]  the biggest Seventh Day Adventists in the country.
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:39.620]  He was like the big head guy in Dallas, had a national TV show, and he'd like get Nixon
[02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:40.620]  on the phone.
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:46.580]  He'd get mad about, you know, corruption or sex stuff, you know, being pushed in Congress
[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:49.700]  or whatever, and he'd say, get me the White House.
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:53.260]  And she remembers that sometimes him actually being able to get through to, you know, head
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:55.540]  people at the White House cuz she was a secretary.
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:58.740]  She's worked there a few years cuz she could work part time and she wanted to take care
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:24:59.740]  of me.
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:05.300]  But she said, I mean, the guy would almost jump up and down angry at corruption and run
[02:25:05.300 --> 02:25:07.600]  around doing stuff and had a national TV show.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:11.780]  So he was certainly a good guy, according to what she said, cuz last time we talked
[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:18.540]  about that is we were talking about Bobby Vaughn, who was the John Bircher who'd come
[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:19.660]  over to the house.
[02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:23.660]  He died of brain cancer a few years ago, longtime family friend, and talk about the New World
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:24.660]  Order.
[02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:26.660]  I remember hearing it the time I was like a year old.
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:33.860]  He was over the house like every day, he was a next door neighbor, he was a nurse.
[02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:37.780]  But then also she said she heard New World Order talk from the Seventh Day Adventist
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:38.780]  guy.
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:40.940]  And I can barely remember his name, I'm not gonna talk about it cuz I don't wanna get
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:41.940]  it wrong.
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:45.840]  I know he had a national TV show and it was like a big deal.
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:50.260]  But I don't know about the Seventh Day Adventist now, I mean, I don't know much about him.
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:55.100]  I know about, what is there, Ellen White or whatever, I read part of that book.
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:57.460]  But I mean, I'm just not gonna get off into it.
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:03.780]  But yes, if your preacher is Baptist, Seventh Day Adventist, Catholic, Jewish, imam, whatever
[02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:04.780]  it is.
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:15.300]  Everybody says, what about this radio show that's talking about New World Order and corruption?
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:18.100]  And they're like, just don't go there, it'll drive you crazy.
[02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:22.220]  That's the standard line of just don't worry, don't get involved, you just don't trouble
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:23.480]  yourself.
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:27.660]  You don't wanna get persecuted or you don't want any trouble, that's clergy response team.
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:31.100]  In fact, I've shown you years after we gave you the documents and everybody balked at
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:36.900]  it, there's not 100 plus thousand secret preachers trained for this.
[02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:43.380]  To tell their flock, give the guns up, go to the FEMA camp when they say, do all these
[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:46.660]  things you're told, take the inoculation.
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:51.260]  And then they have clergy response team on Louisiana TV going, it was the pastors that
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:56.180]  told everyone to go to the camps and to be ready for forced inoculation or whatever's
[02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:57.940]  needed during martial law.
[02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:01.940]  And it shows the preacher saying, do what's of the Lord, don't worry about things, you
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:05.220]  just do whatever the authorities say, that's Romans 13.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:11.220]  You don't trouble yourself, that's a direct FEMA doctrine, Hitler's favorite Bible verse
[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:16.020]  Romans 13 out of context that they use to whip you on the head with.
[02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:23.660]  And if you're hearing that out of a preacher, they've been programmed and you might as well
[02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:26.100]  go to the extreme and go join the Church of Satan.
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:30.740]  I'm being sarcastic, but you might as well just know what you're dealing with is my point
[02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:33.140]  than being told don't be involved.
[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:36.860]  That's the opposite of what Christ taught, that's the opposite of what's in the Bible.
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:40.940]  Don't ask me to give you doctrine for your Christianity or whatever.
[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:45.740]  I'm just telling you that the reason Christians won't fight corruption is because every major
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:48.980]  denomination is getting rid of their preachers.
[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:53.260]  I went to a church here locally, I'm not gonna get into what denomination or whatever, it's
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:57.340]  one my family goes to, and I went sometimes, and they had a preacher that was a little
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:03.260]  bit anti-war, anti-corruption, it was a little left-leaning but kind of old left, it was
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:04.260]  a Methodist church.
[02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:09.440]  And I would get drug in there, and now he's gone, and it's Bill and Melinda Gates are
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:17.800]  gonna save us, and we're all for liberating people's sexual civil rights basically.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:23.180]  It turns into that, and that's what the churches have all turned into, and guns are bad, and
[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:28.020]  I see the Catholic churches sending out letters, turn your guns in, it's of the Lord, and open
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:32.140]  the borders up, it's of the Lord, and they're just global as tools, I mean, period.
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:34.620]  You cannot debate that that's what they're doing.
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:37.820]  Just like in Russia or China, the churches have been taken over.
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:39.900]  But did you wanna say anything about that?
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:43.700]  Yeah, Alex, I wanna add something to that.
[02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:51.460]  The church that I went to down in Southern California was a small, small group, wonderful.
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:58.900]  They had guest speakers all over the country that were main Seventh-day Adventist ministers
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:00.900]  that traveled nationally.
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:03.820]  I don't know if you ever heard of this particular one, his name is Bill Hughes.
[02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:08.100]  No, no, I told you, I haven't followed it, I follow the news and stuff, I got my relationship
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:12.660]  with God, but what I'm asking you is what else did he say?
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:15.940]  He just said, well, just don't trouble yourself, don't get involved in that.
[02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:23.140]  Yeah, specifically on him, just a nice man, clean-cut, very intelligent, tall, then the
[02:29:23.140 --> 02:29:26.780]  gray glasses, very distinguished.
[02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:28.860]  Like Ted Bundy.
[02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:30.700]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:35.300]  A week later, what he would do, he would sit down at the church next to me, and he would
[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:40.900]  talk to me, see how I was doing, and I don't know if he was trying to do some type of connecting
[02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:44.980]  with me there, but we didn't speak much more about it.
[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:48.500]  After you talked about the New World Order, he was intelligence-gathering on you.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:50.300]  Oh, this, hmm.
[02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:51.580]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:53.980]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.980 --> 02:30:01.260]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:04.300]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.

[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:02.380]  Hi, folks.
[02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:03.380]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:08.220]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:09.220]  risk.
[02:31:09.220 --> 02:31:10.420]  Saving means to make money.
[02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:14.620]  The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:20.180]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:25.980]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:27.580]  or antibacterials.
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:33.180]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[02:31:33.180 --> 02:31:35.480]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:38.780]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:40.860]  to do something you've never done before.
[02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:48.960]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[02:31:56.460 --> 02:32:01.900]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:05.860]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:07.500]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:11.540]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:12.540]  or gold?
[02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:15.900]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.080]  possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:22.540]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:23.540]  seeds.

[02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:57.260]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:57.260 --> 02:33:11.260]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:33:11.260 --> 02:33:33.940]  All right, I want to hit some more news here, but I want to continue with your calls.
[02:33:33.940 --> 02:33:41.540]  It just becomes a quagmire when you try to debate different religious groups and things.
[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:45.460]  All people need to know is, is that every religious group in this country and every
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:51.500]  denomination, I mean, it was over 100,000 preachers four years ago, and we haven't gotten
[02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:53.340]  any intel on it since then.
[02:33:53.340 --> 02:34:01.820]  They started out with like 10,000 in 2002 that we know of, and then they kept doubling
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:07.620]  it each year, and it was well over 100,000 by 2008 or so.
[02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:08.940]  And I mean, it's super creepy.
[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:12.860]  We got the document, it's like prepare them for the forced inoculation, prepare them to
[02:34:12.860 --> 02:34:16.820]  go to the emergency centers, prepare them to turn in their firearms and that Jesus would
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:17.820]  want them to.
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:22.760]  Tell them everything's fine, let the emergency take place, do as you're told, and we'll sort
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:23.940]  everything out later.
[02:34:23.940 --> 02:34:28.660]  And we've got all these manuals and handbooks and everything, and then you see the preacher
[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:31.380]  on TV going, do what the Lord tells you.
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:32.900]  We'll sort everything out later.
[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:35.120]  Don't trouble yourselves with what's happening.
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:36.120]  Don't be involved.
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:37.120]  Do what you're told.
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:41.580]  And they said on the newscast, the preachers helped the government with their biggest threat
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:43.980]  and problem, the people.
[02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:48.280]  This idea like it's government and the federal family as they call themselves.
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:55.820]  That's what mafia means, the family, or our thing, la cosa nostra.
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:59.820]  And again, we just do what we're told.
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:03.100]  Sure, you're walking your dog here in the park, well, this is a dog walk park.
[02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:05.100]  Well, it's not now, it's now Forest Service.
[02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:06.100]  I didn't know that.
[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:09.540]  Give me your ID, I don't have one, I'm walking dogs.
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:13.740]  Well, you're detained, ten minutes later, tell me why I'm detained, well, I gotta go,
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:14.740]  I gotta go to work.
[02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:20.700]  I'm leaving, taser, and to them that's reasonable, because they work for narcotics trafficking
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:21.700]  murderers.
[02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:24.140]  By the way, let me go to this and I'll go to your calls.
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:29.980]  ISSA threatens Holder with contempt, Politico, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Darrell
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:33.300]  ISSA, threatened Tuesday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress
[02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:34.300]  of the Justice Department.
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:39.140]  Did not provide certain documents in response to the committee subpoena.
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:43.780]  So I guess they don't care that Holder threatened to bring out Bush's involvement in this pre-Holder.
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.500]  He's going ahead with a little bit there.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:46.500]  Maybe I'm gonna be wrong.
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:49.020]  Maybe they're not just scoring political points.
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:52.880]  In a letter to Holder, ISSA wrote that this committee will have no alternative but to
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:56.540]  move forward with proceedings to hold you in contempt of Congress.
[02:35:56.540 --> 02:36:02.100]  If Holder and DOJ didn't produce documents, they demanded relating to fast and furious
[02:36:02.100 --> 02:36:04.060]  gun walking scandal.
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:07.740]  Holder has until Thursday, February 9th to comply according to ISSA.
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:12.140]  ISSA accused the Justice Department of trying to obstruct our investigation and deceive
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:13.960]  the public by withholding documents.
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:14.960]  Really he got caught lying.
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:20.700]  I mean, folks, I pointed out a year ago when this broke that they gave press conferences
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:24.360]  about their gun walking program three years ago.
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:27.360]  They said the Second Amendment's to blame.
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:33.900]  You have him giving press conferences, I've aired these, with Mrs. Napolitano's, three's
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:36.300]  the charm.
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:42.940]  Ms. Napolitano or Madam, Madam as they call her in Congress, Madam, I guess she is a madam
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:45.860]  pimping us out to the New World Order.
[02:36:45.860 --> 02:36:52.020]  But Madam, cuz she runs all the little pimp gropers at the TSA, and she's saying, I never
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:53.020]  heard of it.
[02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:55.540]  And then you cut to news conferences with her talking about it.
[02:36:55.540 --> 02:36:56.540]  None of this was secret.
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:01.100]  We knew six and a half years ago that there was a program shipping guns into Mexico to
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:06.460]  destabilize things and later blame the Second Amendment before Obama was even on the radar
[02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:07.460]  screen.
[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:11.820]  Celica Steele, all the other interviews I've done, it's all on record.
[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:15.620]  And then in February of last year, it comes out in Chicago, national security declared
[02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:19.860]  in a Sowaloa drug cartel case where they declared national security and said, we're allowed
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:23.980]  to ship cocaine in and you ship us guns.
[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:26.980]  And the government came in and said, national security, we agree it's true, but national
[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:29.020]  security, you cannot bring this up.
[02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:30.860]  And then it came out in other cases.
[02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:33.900]  This was first on prisonplanet.com.
[02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:36.620]  Our listeners pointed it out to us, we wrote an article.
[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:42.180]  Then it was in El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, but never a big national story.
[02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:47.180]  So they knew it was coming out, so 60 Minutes came out and said, well, they ordered gun
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:51.300]  shop owners to let people buy guns illegally to track them.
[02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:54.260]  That was all a cover.
[02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:58.660]  So everybody has that in their head, the sting went wrong.
[02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:01.660]  That was gonna be their cover in Oklahoma City if they got caught, it was a sting gone
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:02.660]  wrong.
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:04.940]  No, no, no, things went as planned.
[02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:10.460]  It's just that ATF people wouldn't go along with it and leaked it.
[02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:13.980]  And investigative journalist Wayne Madsen's done the interviews with high level federal
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:18.260]  whistleblowers and others off record sources confirming what we first heard.
[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:25.060]  That Judge Roll and Giffords, who were both, by the way, pro second amendment in New Mexico
[02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:28.100]  and into the Arizona area, they were investigating in both areas.
[02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:32.300]  They were even talking to West Texas people that were involved, according to Madsen, West
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:37.380]  Texas Congress people, US Congress people about this.
[02:38:37.380 --> 02:38:41.580]  And well, you know the rest of the story, don't you?
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:45.820]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Leon in Nevada.
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:46.820]  Thanks for holding, sir.
[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:50.580]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex, and thanks for giving me a chance to report on a couple of things
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:51.580]  here locally.
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:56.720]  Last night, I went to a local casino here and watched Dr. Ron Paul speak.
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:59.980]  And I gotta say, there was such an amazingly huge crowd.
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:05.460]  It was probably bigger than the 2008 entire county convention that happened.
[02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:10.220]  There was a huge number of people, and when the question was asked how many people planned
[02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:15.020]  on being delegates for Ron Paul this season, I think every hand in the place went up.
[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:16.020]  There had to have been.
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:20.260]  I mean, there was well over 500 people, it was an outstanding event.
[02:39:20.260 --> 02:39:26.780]  And then the other thing I wanted to mention was, you know, the continual habitual sabotage
[02:39:26.780 --> 02:39:31.980]  that the state party does here seems to be going its way again this year.
[02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:38.620]  You know that Sheldon Adelson is a local casino magnate, contributed $10 million to the Gingrich
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:39.620]  campaign.
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:44.500]  Well, evidently here about three weeks ago, the Clark County GOP decided to have a special
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:49.140]  caucus after all of the rest of the caucuses were closed through the state.
[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:52.860]  Here in Clark County, they start at 8 o'clock, and I think they're supposed to wrap up by
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:54.700]  around 3 or 4 o'clock.
[02:39:54.700 --> 02:40:01.860]  A special caucus will be held at 7 p.m., coincidentally at a school that has Sheldon Adelson's name
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:05.580]  on it, the Sheldon Adelson Educational Center.
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:10.860]  And there's a good possibility that they're going to try to fix the numbers on that.
[02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:14.900]  And like I said, again, it's just the habitual sabotage that they keep performing here in
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:15.900]  this state.
[02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:20.340]  I remember when Aaron Russo ran for governor, they did everything they could to discredit
[02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:21.340]  him.
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:25.420]  They shut down the state convention in 08 to prevent a Ron Paul win.
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:29.380]  And then when Sharon Angle got the nomination, they did everything they could to sabotage
[02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:30.380]  her campaign, of course.
[02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:33.380]  No, no, I remember, let me comment on that.
[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:36.100]  That's a lot, I appreciate your calling and holding to talk about that, but I need to
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:37.100]  get to others.
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:41.660]  But let me just comment on things you've talked about there briefly.
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:46.500]  Ron Paul's got all these Hollywood endorsements, all these sports endorsements, more bumper
[02:40:46.500 --> 02:40:53.060]  stickers and signs everywhere, wins all the major polls, straw polls, raises more money
[02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:55.900]  than all candidates combined for the military.
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:59.940]  So by every other metric, he's the front runner, but they keep telling you he can't win, he
[02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:00.940]  can't win.
[02:41:00.940 --> 02:41:06.980]  So when they cheat him, you then feel like, well, he must have not won.
[02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:08.740]  No, there is fraud going on.
[02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:13.820]  But there was fraud four years ago, now they're having more trouble.
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:19.860]  He's there getting the word out about liberty, and it's exposing election fraud.
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:23.580]  And it shows people when they give him less debate time, and when they do cover him, they're
[02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:24.580]  negative.
[02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:28.700]  Or when he does win a poll, he'll be number one, so they don't mention who was number
[02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:29.700]  one.
[02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:31.460]  They don't mention who got number two.
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:35.140]  That's showing people that it's a rigged fight.
[02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:39.220]  Don King had to put on a lot of rigged fights before people finally stopped watching his
[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:40.820]  pay per views.
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:44.180]  And so we point out it's fake.
[02:41:44.180 --> 02:41:48.220]  People say, well, that's an oxymoron, support Ron Paul, give him money, get behind him,
[02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:49.480]  but you're saying there's fraud.
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:51.900]  Not everywhere, but it's enough to throw it.
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:56.620]  But you get on the field because that's how you expose it, that's not an oxymoron.
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:01.620]  People that look at things in a one-dimensional way see it as an oxymoron, so that's going
[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:02.620]  on.
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:06.300]  Also, I'll be honest, I didn't do a lot of research on this.
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:09.780]  I mean, I've got some background knowledge, quite a bit actually.
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:13.700]  But I don't listen to neocon radio, I don't follow a lot of what they're up to, I see
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.700]  bits and pieces.
[02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:22.240]  And I've now really done some research last week to see why one part of the Republican
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.460]  establishment is attacking Newt Gingrich and the other half is saying he's basically God.
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.460]  And what's going on there?
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:32.540]  There's a lot of things, Gingrich is unstable, is dangerous, is connected many Republican
[02:42:32.540 --> 02:42:33.540]  leaders.
[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:36.380]  And I said this years ago, but now they're coming out with it as basically a Democratic
[02:42:36.380 --> 02:42:42.080]  operative and tied in with the Clintonistas.
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:45.220]  He's been endorsed by Sarah Palin, who's a big globalist.
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:52.860]  He's been endorsed by all these other former senators and people, Thompson, the rest of
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:54.300]  them.
[02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:56.340]  And I actually did some research.
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:04.820]  He's been endorsed by all the big neocon talk show host, all of them.
[02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:09.540]  Which is weird cuz you've got Mitt Romney tied in with Bain Capital, especially in the
[02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:12.460]  past, still to some extent owns most of Clear Channel.
[02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:15.020]  So it's really weird.
[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:22.300]  But the reason you're seeing such a attack on Gingrich is I think because they know he's
[02:43:22.300 --> 02:43:27.820]  got so much luggage that he is basically a ringer any way you slice it.
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:30.140]  But I mean, Mitt Romney's a globalist too, so it's a mess.
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:35.020]  But I saw an article in The New York Times, I mean, there's hundreds of articles I see
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:36.020]  come across.
[02:43:36.020 --> 02:43:39.140]  I don't have time to read them, but I scanned the headline.
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:44.220]  Attacking Drudge, and the normal thing is to say Drudge is dead, no one visits Drudge
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:48.860]  when he's got more traffic than ever, more than New York Times, Twitter, Facebook combined.
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:51.540]  You look that up.
[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:57.340]  And then I saw literally articles everywhere, mainly from the control left saying he's endorsing
[02:43:57.340 --> 02:43:58.340]  Mitt Romney.
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:01.980]  Well, I look at Drudge every day, that's not what's happening.
[02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:06.140]  Drudge, when there's a big Ron Paul volley, is covering Ron Paul.
[02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:09.520]  Or when there's a big deal with the Gingrich or somebody, he covers that.
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.180]  He covers whatever the zeitgeist is, he's got a nose for the zeitgeist.
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:19.460]  If you want a quote for Matt Drudge, he has a nose for the zeitgeist because it's what
[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:20.460]  he's into.
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:24.100]  And so they're trying to say he's got some political acts.
[02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:27.900]  Well, all the media has their own views go into things.
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:29.780]  You can tell he doesn't like the TSA.
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:34.860]  You can tell he's broken in the last five years and forced the mainstream media to admit
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:37.500]  Bilderberg's real by carrying our articles.
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:40.340]  And now that mainstream media is covering it, he links to them too.
[02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:44.820]  I mean, Drudge, I used to listen to his radio show on Sunday nights whenever I got a chance
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:49.140]  because he was against cloning and all this crazy stuff and spying and surveillance.
[02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:52.200]  He gets it, he gets it.
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:54.700]  He got run out of Fox News because he was pro-life.
[02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:59.180]  They don't want somebody up there, they want him to say I'm pro-life, but then not rock
[02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:01.140]  the boat and keep it going.
[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:07.380]  So they've got all these articles coming out saying, my gosh, he's endorsing Mitt Romney.
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:09.420]  And that's not what's happening.
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:14.380]  A lot of Republicans and people, all he was doing is linking to all these articles, pointing
[02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:18.140]  out how bad Newt Gingrich is.
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:22.500]  And when stuff was coming out on other candidates like Rick Perry, he was linking to it because
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:27.380]  that's the feeding frenzy, that's the news, that's what's going on.
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:35.260]  He mainly just covers what is the real zeitgeist on the Internet, not the zeitgeist that the
[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:38.980]  prostitutes try to create.
[02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:43.060]  He covers the buzz, I'd say 80% of it's that.
[02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:44.060]  It's just whatever is interesting.
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:49.620]  Like you go there, there's an article about pythons all over Florida killing most of the
[02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:50.620]  wildlife.
[02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:51.780]  That's interesting.
[02:45:51.780 --> 02:45:56.420]  Or tasering a guy for walking his dogs at what was a dog park a week before and now
[02:45:56.420 --> 02:45:59.020]  is a national park.
[02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:01.300]  That's interesting.
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:05.060]  And so what it's about is it's about jealousy.
[02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:09.180]  And that's why the establishment media attacks us and says we're not credible as well.
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:15.060]  Because I wear my views on my sleeve.
[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:18.980]  I talk about what I really think, I'm not hiding what I stand for.
[02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:21.300]  And I'm giving you my views, my facts, my analysis.
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:24.540]  All right, I'm done talking about that.
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:26.780]  And again, you wanna know where Drudge is at?
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:32.420]  He's the guy more than any other big media outlet who's covered the cover up of Ron Paul.
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:34.220]  He's carried our articles.
[02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:37.580]  He's covered the suppression.
[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:41.500]  He's covered all of that.
[02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:45.740]  So basically, it is a grassroots zeitgeist deal.
[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:49.580]  It's a big zeitgeist that Ron Paul's being suppressed.
[02:46:49.580 --> 02:46:56.780]  He covers it, breaks, they're scared of Drudge because he's able to block media whore blockades.
[02:46:56.780 --> 02:47:00.460]  He's able to break media blackouts.
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:05.660]  And more and more, as things get proven to Drudge that Bilderberg's real and wants world
[02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:07.540]  government, he's covering it.
[02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:11.260]  As more and more comes out about the whole New World Order plan, he's covering it.
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:16.900]  And the fact that that can drive the major news is really freaking out the establishment.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:19.660]  And they call him the Howard Hughes in this article.
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:21.180]  Well, you know what?
[02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:24.960]  I've had people show up in parking lots and ask me if I wanna blow stuff up before.
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:25.960]  They're clearly a cop.
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:28.820]  I mean, maybe I should be like Howard Hughes.
[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:32.580]  Maybe it's good Drudge doesn't really associate with the neocons anymore and go to their parties
[02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:33.580]  and hang out with people.
[02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:40.300]  Let me tell you something, when you wake up to reality, none of that crud matters anymore.
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:42.020]  Matt Drudge is the Howard Hughes of the Internet.
[02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:45.380]  Like Hughes, he lives in splendid isolation, communicating only through a small group of
[02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:46.500]  trusted friends.
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:50.520]  Like Hughes, his influence has quietly helped shape Republican politics for generations.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:54.460]  But while the eccentric Hughes used money to put his pals in the White House, Drudge
[02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:56.460]  has always relied on blogs and tweets.
[02:47:56.460 --> 02:47:59.780]  The Drudge Report, which started its life as an email gossip column, now receives millions
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:02.380]  of unique visitors per month, about per day.
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:06.980]  I mean, this is supposedly a positive article and they can't even get that right.
[02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:10.260]  One time, Infowars is getting a million a day, folks, come on.
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:15.340]  Drudge is like, we're like a small mountain, there's like this big Mount Olympus over here.
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:19.020]  One study found that it drives more traffic than Twitter, Facebook combined.
[02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:22.220]  Drudge's claim to be authentic voice of conservative movement is now under attack last week and
[02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:23.220]  it just goes on.
[02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:31.660]  Now, yeah, he's not authentic conservative cuz the New York Times says so.
[02:48:31.660 --> 02:48:38.300]  No, they're attacking Drudge, folks, cuz he's going off the reservation, yeah.
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:40.300]  How do I know?
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:51.340]  Well, I don't talk about private stuff, but Drudge did put out a tweet saying, Alex Jones,
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:52.860]  here's a quote from Alex Jones.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:58.500]  Guys, Google Drudge tweets Alex Jones, I forget, it was a quote from the show, he tweeted it
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:48:59.500]  the day after.
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:07.060]  It was a Sunday show where I said, living in reality is exhausting, I mean, there's
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:10.420]  no rest for those living in reality, was basically the quote.
[02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:17.260]  And obviously, I see Drudge, I wake up sometimes at 3 AM and I'm seeing updating.
[02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:22.580]  Because once you get into this stuff, it's addicting, I mean, if I just dedicated myself
[02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:25.700]  to having something like the Drudge Report, I couldn't do the job he does.
[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:30.220]  I mean, he just is always on, always on, always on.
[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:34.360]  And these media whores, I mean, you got the New York Times, last time I saw it, it spends
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.780]  like 300, 400 million a year to run the New York Times or more.
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:48.480]  And it has less traffic than Drudge, they don't like that, they want to set the agenda,
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:49.480]  they wanna run the show.
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:53.740]  Let's jam another call right now, Tara in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:55.860]  Hey, you can hear me?
[02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:56.860]  Yes, I can, welcome.
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:57.860]  Hi, I've been holding for a while.
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:50:05.220]  I started out wanting to call you about the whole schools turning into prisons thing,
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:09.100]  because we don't see it here close to DC yet.
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:14.100]  But I'm just gonna go ahead with what you were just talking about.
[02:50:14.100 --> 02:50:17.980]  Drudge is just not going along with what they want.
[02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:21.780]  And the reason that you know that he's going off the reservation, cuz that's how they treat
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:22.780]  you.
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:29.500]  And if anybody out there, if somebody is getting attacked and getting discredited, it's because
[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:31.220]  they're on point completely.
[02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:34.980]  Well, that's it, stay there, I wanna hear what your other point was, a little bit of
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:35.980]  overdrive against everybody.
[02:50:35.980 --> 02:50:39.740]  I'll get to Tara, Brandon, Nick, Alex and Dean at least.
[02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:42.340]  And I haven't even plugged books, videos, nothing.
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:45.900]  We got Bloodlines Illuminati back in print, we've got all the copies.
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:50.160]  It's selling out quick, you won't want it, it's an incredible tabletop sized book.
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:54.540]  And by the way, the guys wanna extend the early bird, 44% off on a yearly membership.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:51:01.820]  We're gonna extend that for another week, 44% off on a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:06.180]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights
[02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:08.460]  and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:12.860]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:18.740]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:19.740]  be satisfied.
[02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:24.020]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com, but I wanna point out
[02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:31.620]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:39.500]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:43.340]  than 37 pounds in just two months, now that's results.
[02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:49.720]  I wanna challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products

[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:38.500]  Hey, teacher!
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:39.500]  Leave them kids alone.
[02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:45.740]  Don't build a wall.
[02:54:45.740 --> 02:54:46.740]  Knock down theirs.
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:49.540]  People say, how do I handle all this?
[02:54:49.540 --> 02:54:50.540]  I fight.
[02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:51.540]  I stomp globalist.
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:55.660]  All you got to do is get off the porch, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:56.660]  Get off the couch.
[02:54:56.660 --> 02:54:58.660]  You can beat them.
[02:54:58.660 --> 02:55:04.180]  All right, Tara, make that other point you wanted to make.

[02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:10.620]  I got a little three-year-old and a four-year-old.
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:11.620]  Oh.
[02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:14.620]  And, oh, and you hear me screaming.
[02:55:14.620 --> 02:55:15.620]  Yeah, that's mine.
[02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:16.620]  Little sweetsies.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:17.620]  Stop fighting.
[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:21.740]  And anyway, what I've been holding for a while.
[02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:22.740]  I understand.
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:23.740]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:30.740]  What I was going to say is we don't see that the whole prison, or I have a 15-year-old
[02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:33.100]  student who went through regular, is going through regular school.
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:36.940]  We don't see that here in Northern Virginia yet.
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:41.700]  Like it's going on in California, but we do- Well, you must not live in the city.
[02:55:41.700 --> 02:55:45.500]  Yeah, no, it's the cities that have turned into prisons, and that's because the culture's
[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:50.540]  been under welfare, the family's been destroyed, and so the society is collapsing.
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:52.660]  The family is collapsing.
[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:55.500]  They're just a generation deeper into new world order control.
[02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:59.980]  Well, that being said, I really don't want to send these two kids to regular school.
[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:02.060]  I'm already starting to homeschool them.
[02:56:02.060 --> 02:56:06.820]  I've got my four-year-old reading at a first grade level already, and I don't want to do
[02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:11.020]  that, and I'm bumping heads up against a husband who is not awake.
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:15.900]  Well, look, if you got to, check out the school, get as rural as you can.
[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:18.420]  I can't, because we're Northern Virginia.
[02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:19.420]  We're suburbs.
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:22.220]  Yeah, so you're over by, what, D.C. then?
[02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:23.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:56:23.220 --> 02:56:24.220]  Oh, man, are you kidding?
[02:56:24.220 --> 02:56:28.220]  Well, I come from a family of government workers and military.
[02:56:28.220 --> 02:56:32.740]  Yeah, well, yeah, that's all defense contractors around there.
[02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:35.740]  That's actually my bread and butter, or our bread and butter right there.
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:43.060]  So I'm right in the belly of the beast per se, and it's hard for him to take what I'm
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:44.060]  trying to tell him.
[02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:45.060]  He doesn't want to hear it.
[02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:46.060]  He really gets mad at me.
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:49.700]  Give him literature on vaccines, on aspartame, all of it.
[02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:50.700]  God bless you.
[02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:53.580]  I understand you work as a defense contractor.
[02:56:53.580 --> 02:56:57.900]  You want to believe you're building the drones or whatever it is to save the free world when
[02:56:57.900 --> 02:57:03.140]  the drones are meant to replace all the humans and the globalists can use them against us.
[02:57:03.140 --> 02:57:04.660]  Let's talk to Brandon in West Virginia.
[02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:05.660]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:06.660]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:07.660]  Good.
[02:57:07.660 --> 02:57:08.660]  Good.
[02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:09.660]  Hey, just wanted to thank you, man.
[02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:16.900]  I've been a huge fan of yours, and thanks for being such a patriot against this huge
[02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:19.980]  evil we're fighting here, trying to restore the public.
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:20.980]  Thank you.
[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:29.540]  But, yeah, I'm a U.S. Marine, just got off active duty, got back from Afghanistan, and
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:36.300]  just wanted to talk a little bit about the indefinite indentation bill that actually
[02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:41.980]  is pretty scary, man, that actually passed- Yeah, they're saying they want to use you
[02:57:41.980 --> 02:57:46.900]  in America and have you secretly arrest us, put a bag on my head, and I disappear.
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:48.900]  Does that sound like something the good guys do?
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:52.220]  Oh, no, no, man, this is horrible.
[02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:59.660]  And it surprised me, the U.S. Senate voted 86 to 13 in favor.
[02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:08.140]  I mean, I couldn't believe it when I heard- Now, hold on, I think they voted 93, 93 to
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:09.660]  7, but maybe you're right.
[02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:10.660]  I'm going from memory.
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:16.700]  Yeah, I'm reading off the internet now, it said 86 to 13, and I was just totally surprised
[02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:17.700]  about this.
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:23.780]  And, you know, the whole policy comment taught us we're not supposed to be accused against
[02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:30.020]  American citizens and everything like that, but I just want to, you know, when the economic
[02:58:30.020 --> 02:58:36.900]  collapse happens, and it does, and, you know, they actually will have, yeah, you know-
[02:58:36.900 --> 02:58:52.180]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, we're going to come back.
[02:58:52.180 --> 02:58:56.460]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:58:56.460 --> 02:59:01.060]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:04.900]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:07.620]  anywhere in or on the body.
[02:59:07.620 --> 02:59:12.380]  My name is Mario Sifaldi, and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator.
[02:59:12.380 --> 02:59:16.980]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:22.140]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[02:59:22.140 --> 02:59:25.140]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:59:25.140 --> 02:59:31.340]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[02:59:31.340 --> 02:59:33.020]  digestive system.
[02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:40.220]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:43.380]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[02:59:43.380 --> 02:59:47.420]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:59:47.420 --> 02:59:52.420]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:59:52.420 --> 02:59:55.900]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:03.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:03.980 --> 03:00:23.940]  All right, we're talking to Brandon, who's a Marine just back from Afghanistan.
[03:00:23.940 --> 03:00:28.780]  We'll jam in a few more here, but you were saying when the economic collapse comes, please
[03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:29.780]  continue.
[03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:36.020]  Yeah, if the economic collapse comes, and hopefully it doesn't, we can get Ron Paul
[03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:37.820]  in there.
[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:43.780]  I know I've woken up hundreds of Marines that use Ron Paul supporters and actually woken
[03:00:43.780 --> 03:00:48.020]  them up to the new world order and know what's going on.
[03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:49.020]  And that's the big thing.
[03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:54.820]  I mean, without us or with the police, the globalists, the Bilderbergers, they can't
[03:00:54.820 --> 03:00:55.820]  carry out their-
[03:00:55.820 --> 03:00:57.860]  And by the way, they've all committed crimes.
[03:00:57.860 --> 03:01:00.100]  Look at Corzine, caught stealing money.
[03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:05.820]  We know where it went, we know who he got it, where it went, and he's caught lying and
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:06.820]  no one's getting in trouble.
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:08.380]  I mean, they're a bunch of crooks.
[03:01:08.380 --> 03:01:14.060]  I mean, it should be easy to wake people up and throw them in jail and get our country
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:15.060]  back.
[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:16.060]  Exactly.
[03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:22.020]  I've been waking up Marines ever since I found out, I actually got on Info Wars from another
[03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:24.980]  Marine friend and woke up.
[03:01:24.980 --> 03:01:30.700]  And like you said earlier, once you're awake, it's so easy to see what's going on, man.
[03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:31.700]  Let me ask you about the opium.
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:35.940]  Have you seen the newscast where they show the Marines order to help grow it?
[03:01:35.940 --> 03:01:37.620]  No, man.
[03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:43.220]  When I was in Afghanistan, we weren't even, I mean, the opium wasn't even an issue.
[03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:49.660]  Just let the opium grow, let everything like that.
[03:01:49.660 --> 03:01:57.140]  We're there to nation build, get the Afghan people away from the Taliban and all this.
[03:01:57.140 --> 03:02:01.980]  The whole time, I've done two deployments in Afghanistan, two deployments in Iraq.
[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:08.460]  I have not seen one single actual Al Qaeda member out of the whole thing.
[03:02:08.460 --> 03:02:09.460]  And I-
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:13.940]  There's a new group in England who was inspired by Al Qaeda, it's always inspired.
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:19.300]  Hey, are any of your Marine buddies going, why is Al Qaeda being given Libya?
[03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:26.900]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, no, no, nobody's there, we haven't really talked about that.
[03:02:26.900 --> 03:02:30.140]  I've talked to Marine and Army people who were there in the first few years, they said
[03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:31.980]  they would go with CNN.
[03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:36.300]  Two separate, one's Army, one's Marine, one's a Ranger, one's a Force Recon.
[03:02:36.300 --> 03:02:40.500]  But the point is, and they said they would go with CNN and say, we're here in an Al Qaeda
[03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:41.900]  base, no one's ever been here.
[03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:45.620]  And there'd be MREs and stuff everywhere, and they'd find out from their buddy later
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:49.140]  that their unit had been there a month before with Fox News.
[03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:50.300]  It was all fake.
[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:53.060]  He said they'd blow up fake bunkers, everything else.
[03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:55.620]  Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely.
[03:02:55.620 --> 03:03:00.700]  I mean, I was in the Sangat District, was like the last time I met a stronghold.
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:08.340]  And the Afghan war is basically, I mean, basically won, according to the globalists.
[03:03:08.340 --> 03:03:11.900]  They basically accomplished what they won out of Afghanistan, but of course, they're
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:16.380]  gonna drag it on and keep on- Well, I mean, isn't Afghanistan just a bunch
[03:03:16.380 --> 03:03:21.060]  of tribes killing each other, who'll be killing each other when the troops are gone?
[03:03:21.060 --> 03:03:26.300]  That's it, it's just a lawless, corrupt society.
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:28.940]  I mean, there's no point of us being there.
[03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:31.220]  I'm a huge Ron Paul supporter.
[03:03:31.220 --> 03:03:33.220]  We just need to get our troops back home.
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:34.820]  There's no threat.
[03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:41.300]  The Taliban, or so-called Taliban, whatever they are, I mean, they fight us.
[03:03:41.300 --> 03:03:44.540]  We go out there on patrol, they ambush us, whatever.
[03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:46.660]  It's probably just we're on their turf.
[03:03:46.660 --> 03:03:52.340]  I mean, you look at it the other way around, I see a Chinese guy walking down, a squad
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:55.760]  walking down my street, taking over my country.
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:56.760]  You know what?
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:03:59.100]  He goes, I'm gonna go crazy too, bro.
[03:03:59.100 --> 03:04:04.060]  I'm gonna, you know, but anyway- So the Marines know that, they understand
[03:04:04.060 --> 03:04:05.060]  that?
[03:04:05.060 --> 03:04:10.300]  Yeah, yeah, at least my Marines do, my Marines- Well, then they must know Ron Paul's getting
[03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:12.300]  the majority of the donations.
[03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:13.940]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[03:04:13.940 --> 03:04:18.980]  Look, Nick, Alex, and Dean, I got to most people, you guys haven't been holding a lot
[03:04:18.980 --> 03:04:19.980]  compared to the other people.
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:23.900]  Call me back tomorrow, if you get through, you'll be first to the line.
[03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:27.180]  I covered a lot of it, I didn't get to the boa constrictors that have eaten 80%.
[03:04:27.180 --> 03:04:30.180]  Is that what it says, I'm going from memory?
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:35.860]  90% of wild mammals in Florida are now dead, and there's giant 16-foot boa constrictors
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:36.860]  running around.
[03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:38.580]  This is the London Independent.
[03:04:38.580 --> 03:04:41.520]  There's a big National Academy of Sciences report on it.
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:43.700]  Talk about invasive species.
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:46.340]  Why in the park service they're killing these?
[03:04:46.340 --> 03:04:50.860]  Oh, no, let's not worry about pythons everywhere that can eat humans.
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:55.260]  Let's go harass people walking their dogs at a dog park and taser them, because you're
[03:04:55.260 --> 03:04:58.140]  like, oh, this is a dog park last week, give me your stuff.
[03:04:58.140 --> 03:04:59.140]  I don't have an idea.
[03:04:59.140 --> 03:05:00.140]  Oh, you're tasered, bzzz.
[03:05:00.140 --> 03:05:22.180]  Meanwhile, the pythons, they're our limit.
