[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:32.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.000 --> 00:40.000]  Okay, very important broadcast. Incredibly important transmission lined up today. Just
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.440]  off the charts information. And we tend to be so comfortable living inside this new world
[00:47.440 --> 00:54.880]  order that as it radically accelerates its global program of warfare, dehumanization,
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.920]  impoverishment.
[00:56.920 --> 01:04.280]  And overthrows every form of liberty and ancient system of freedom and law. From the Magna
[01:04.280 --> 01:12.500]  Carta to the Constitution to similar laws and codes around the world. Even I tend to
[01:12.500 --> 01:20.320]  just get punch drunk from it and just expect it to happen. So today we're going to really
[01:20.320 --> 01:28.840]  focus predominantly on the designed global financial implosion.
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.760]  That the six big mega banks are openly launching to bring the world under their control through
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.460]  fraud and to have the trader leaders that they have installed trick the public into
[01:40.460 --> 01:45.780]  signing on to debt bondage. Now on top of that, they're gonna have environmentalist
[01:45.780 --> 01:49.480]  tyranny that has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.320]  As a carbon tax that's accelerating with the airlines, the counties, the cities, the states.
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.760]  They don't care, they're just going ahead with it worldwide, global standardization.
[02:00.760 --> 02:10.900]  But the big news obviously is Iran. Why would they try to start a war with a country that
[02:10.900 --> 02:18.160]  is armed to the teeth and has China backing them up? And that many mainline analysts have
[02:18.160 --> 02:26.120]  said could lead to World War III will definitely lead to a short term industrial depression
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.440]  in Europe.
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.540]  There's different numbers, but roughly 40% of the world's oil supply on any given day
[02:33.540 --> 02:41.300]  travels through the Strait of Hormuz. The globalist are shutting off Iranian oil sales.
[02:41.300 --> 02:48.520]  That's about half the money their government gets to fund the whole country. And they're
[02:48.520 --> 02:55.160]  banning the importation of gasoline. The EU set, the US is involved, NATO, they're set
[02:55.160 --> 03:00.200]  to vote on this in two and a half weeks.
[03:00.200 --> 03:04.480]  Two and a half weeks, regardless of what you think about the Iranians. This is not gonna
[03:04.480 --> 03:10.120]  be another Turkey shoot like sending in the giant US military behind the scenes on record
[03:10.120 --> 03:18.840]  paying off the main Iraqi military. Over 90% of it they paid, the generals and others beforehand
[03:18.840 --> 03:29.280]  to stand down when the invasion of 2003 kicked off after 13, 14 years of sanctions, on and
[03:29.280 --> 03:39.240]  off bombing, UN inspectors in dismantling it, Saddam, a total tin horn third world dictator.
[03:39.240 --> 03:43.840]  And we lost 6,000 US troops and conservatively a million Iraqis died one way or another from
[03:43.840 --> 03:50.080]  the war. That's the British Lancet Journal and many other prestigious groups in 2007
[03:50.080 --> 03:57.360]  said it was a mill, probably a million, 200,000. We know this, Iraq was 26 million, it's now
[03:57.360 --> 04:00.800]  23 million, and they estimate about 2 million of those have fled the country.
[04:00.800 --> 04:08.920]  So a million people went bye bye into a fog. And the West funded Shiite and Sunnis to kill
[04:08.920 --> 04:15.040]  each other, to create destabilization, to create the perception of a war. Show that
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.680]  the West could stay there and have no bid contracts and build up its bases and terrorist
[04:19.680 --> 04:25.880]  forces, Al-Qaeda forces to launch attacks into Iran, which is now going on. And the
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.720]  controlled media thinks you're so stupid, they tell you Iran runs Al-Qaeda.
[04:31.720 --> 04:37.400]  Iran is arch enemies with Saudi Arabian Wahhabist. They are Shiite, as Iran fund what you call
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.520]  asymmetrical warfare or terrorist. You bet your bucks they do, your bottom dollar. You
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.880]  bet your hind end they do. But to have our so-called media telling us that they're running
[04:48.880 --> 04:54.640]  Al-Qaeda, when our criminal government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, that's
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.240]  the fact. So you've got big confrontation coming up on the other side. We'll break it
[04:59.240 --> 05:01.520]  down.
[05:01.520 --> 05:06.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[05:06.520 --> 05:12.000]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.960]  from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president and
[05:16.960 --> 05:23.480]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[05:23.480 --> 05:29.680]  citizens to pay attention. The Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore
[05:29.680 --> 05:35.360]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[05:39.720 --> 05:44.080]  is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right
[05:44.080 --> 05:50.400]  now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of
[05:50.400 --> 05:57.140]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality

[05:58.640 --> 06:04.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[06:04.240 --> 06:09.400]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[06:09.400 --> 06:13.380]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true seeds and outperform
[06:13.380 --> 06:17.740]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[06:17.740 --> 06:21.920]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[06:21.920 --> 06:28.000]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.500]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[06:32.500 --> 06:37.880]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[06:37.880 --> 06:43.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[06:43.640 --> 06:55.240]  call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[06:55.240 --> 07:00.040]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[08:07.020 --> 08:21.460]  continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. There is absolutely no doubt now
[08:21.460 --> 08:32.540]  that Europe, the United States, Israel, as well as England are preparing a military confrontation
[08:32.540 --> 08:41.780]  with the heavily armed 76 million person Iranian population.
[08:41.780 --> 08:49.180]  And we have the headline by Kurt Nemo that breaks it all down. Alert, Iran crisis headed
[08:49.180 --> 08:57.560]  for World War III. And he has the links to the mainline communist Chinese government
[08:57.560 --> 09:07.460]  run newspapers saying they will back Iran during a military attack. The Russians have
[09:07.460 --> 09:13.780]  also deployed some of their fleets and are saying they will defend Syria during an attack.
[09:13.780 --> 09:20.620]  US military forces have been deployed. As of last week, Israeli papers reported with
[09:20.620 --> 09:31.380]  almost no coverage here. Between the Lebanon-Syrian border, at least 2,000 US troops were deployed,
[09:31.380 --> 09:37.220]  not for an exercise, but what Jerusalem Post called a deployment to coordinate military
[09:37.220 --> 09:46.540]  operations from air, land, and sea between the US, IDF, Israeli Defense Forces.
[09:46.540 --> 09:57.980]  Between the US and IDF forces. As you know, last week, the Iranian government, the head
[09:57.980 --> 10:03.180]  of their Joint Chiefs of Staff, and their top admiral above said, if you enter this
[10:03.180 --> 10:08.580]  area and do military drills off our coastline and the Strait of Hormuz, it will be your
[10:08.580 --> 10:14.420]  last warning. You have your last warning, do not return, that's a quote. Do not return,
[10:14.420 --> 10:20.900]  this is your only warning.
[10:20.900 --> 10:26.620]  Now the West, if you read the fine print of what the Euro, the EU dictatorship is pushing,
[10:26.620 --> 10:31.180]  the countries aren't allowed to vote on it, they're just in it. They're announcing they're
[10:31.180 --> 10:38.020]  gonna start blocking gasoline imports into Iran. They import over 50%, probably 51% of
[10:38.020 --> 10:45.340]  their refined gasoline, and they export oil and then import it back refined.
[10:45.340 --> 10:49.740]  They don't have the money and the infrastructure to refine more than half of the fuel they
[10:49.740 --> 10:56.360]  need. So what they run their country off of oil, imagine if the United States had half
[10:56.360 --> 11:04.660]  its gasoline cut off. They are putting Iran into an absolute confrontation mode. Just
[11:04.660 --> 11:10.620]  as Lindsey Williams source said, just as the Rand Corporation called for three years ago,
[11:10.620 --> 11:11.620]  it is happening.
[11:11.620 --> 11:18.020]  On top of this Saturday, the United States and Israel announced they are going to send
[11:18.020 --> 11:29.800]  in the next five days their fleets into the Strait of Hormuz, including US missile cruisers
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.340]  with nuclear weapons, Israeli missile cruisers with nuclear weapons, Israeli submarines with
[11:34.340 --> 11:39.260]  nuclear weapons. It is insane what's happening.
[11:39.260 --> 11:43.780]  And if you turn on the news, as I did this morning and last night, you're hearing about
[11:43.780 --> 11:53.980]  Tebow or Tybo or whatever his name is. You're hearing about the latest fashion shows. You're
[11:53.980 --> 12:02.860]  hearing about how great and invincible Mitt, open borders, carbon tax, pro-abortion, anti-gun,
[12:02.860 --> 12:04.940]  Obamacare author.
[12:04.940 --> 12:10.820]  How he's invincible and the presumptive nominee for the Republicans and CBS, we have a video
[12:10.820 --> 12:21.860]  coming up later. CBS ran a news piece, just as others have done in past polls, and they
[12:21.860 --> 12:28.780]  mentioned first, third, fourth, and fifth, and don't mention Ron Paul in second, right
[12:28.780 --> 12:29.780]  behind Mitt Romney.
[12:29.780 --> 12:35.780]  We have an article on that by Paul Watson and Infowars.com with links to the video as
[12:35.780 --> 12:42.680]  well and a screenshot of the poll. This is the way they treat the American people. Now,
[12:42.680 --> 12:49.900]  why is this Iran situation so important? Right as the globalist implode the world economy,
[12:49.900 --> 12:56.020]  have government sign sovereignty in Europe and the US through the super Congress, through
[12:56.020 --> 12:59.780]  the super unelected EU bureaucracy.
[12:59.780 --> 13:04.380]  As the public is told, it's their debt when 90 plus percent of it's not your debt. Tens
[13:04.380 --> 13:09.340]  of trillions a year pumped out in Europe, in the US, into black hole private banks.
[13:09.340 --> 13:12.620]  They tell Congress, they tell the European individual nations, we won't tell you where
[13:12.620 --> 13:17.580]  the money went. Private lawsuits find out because they're plaintiffs, some of it's their
[13:17.580 --> 13:18.580]  money.
[13:18.580 --> 13:22.540]  They take people's private money, steal it out of accounts, bring down banks, bring down
[13:22.540 --> 13:27.860]  companies, and then get bailouts from government and don't even use it to prop up companies.
[13:27.860 --> 13:32.980]  They just shut them down and keep it. I mean, the world, according to all the former top
[13:32.980 --> 13:37.580]  federal regulators like William K Black and others that sent hundreds to prison for just
[13:37.580 --> 13:40.200]  the small SNL, nothing compared to this.
[13:40.200 --> 13:47.660]  This is several orders of magnitude, meaning exponentially, logarithmically bigger. The
[13:47.660 --> 13:55.220]  globalist are madmen, 40 to 1 bets with people's private bank accounts, hailed by the media
[13:55.220 --> 14:02.340]  as absolutely cool top advisor to Obama, Corzine. Lies to Congress, gets caught, head of the
[14:02.340 --> 14:07.140]  Texas CME Group, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, says he's lying.
[14:07.140 --> 14:14.420]  Nobody gets in trouble. I mean, we're seeing magnitudes of corruption by two magnitudes
[14:14.420 --> 14:23.820]  at least. Two logarithmic, exponential, hyperbolic, gargantuan, dwarfing, anything ever seen.
[14:23.820 --> 14:29.380]  An orgy of all out stealing everything. You know why? Cuz they're gonna blow stuff up,
[14:29.380 --> 14:34.100]  they might even nuke cities, and fire bomb, and bomb police stations, and blame it on
[14:34.100 --> 14:36.620]  domestic groups.
[14:36.620 --> 14:40.940]  And the whore media will line up and say it's domestic groups, and the good old boys will
[14:40.940 --> 14:45.900]  get out and salute while talk show hosts are being arrested and drug off. That's what the
[14:45.900 --> 14:52.260]  globalist are counting on. Now I'm telling you, they could say Iran did it, they could
[14:52.260 --> 14:54.820]  say anything, they could release a bio weapon.
[14:54.820 --> 14:59.900]  They could do any false flag you can imagine, but the entire system is set up around continuity
[14:59.900 --> 15:06.100]  of government and total takeover of society. And this is an absolute red level emergency
[15:06.100 --> 15:15.780]  situation. The globalist have shown that they are so wild with hubris and arrogance that
[15:15.780 --> 15:18.780]  they are capable of anything.
[15:18.780 --> 15:26.060]  We learned a year and a half ago and nobody got in trouble that the top 14 insurance companies
[15:26.060 --> 15:32.020]  themselves subsidiaries of the six mega banks, Prudential and others. This was in Bloomberg
[15:32.020 --> 15:39.300]  AP, but never made it your local paper, never a big nightly news item. Made deals to take
[15:39.300 --> 15:45.860]  the death benefits of US troops from World War II through current.
[15:45.860 --> 15:50.540]  I mean, that's cold blooded folks to take people's private insurance policies, because
[15:50.540 --> 15:55.700]  the Department of Defense administers them. I mean, these are just naked crooks, but they
[15:55.700 --> 16:06.760]  know how to start a war with a country they've overthrown twice and set up torture groups.
[16:06.760 --> 16:10.940]  And they probably are running the moolahs today to some extent, Iran, Contra, help put
[16:10.940 --> 16:11.940]  them in power in 79.
[16:11.940 --> 16:15.980]  I mean, go look it up if you didn't know the globalist. See, it's the mega banks playing
[16:15.980 --> 16:22.380]  us all off against each other, and they want a giant political diversion. They want a giant
[16:22.380 --> 16:31.780]  political distraction. They want a giant earth-shattering, earth-shaking war, a huge event where aircraft
[16:31.780 --> 16:36.340]  carriers are on fire and missiles are being fired and tactical nukes are being launched
[16:36.340 --> 16:43.140]  in Iran and Iranian sleeper cells, which Iran actually says they've got no use.
[16:43.140 --> 16:48.020]  The globalists may not have to stage a false flag. They'll have Iranians bombing New York,
[16:48.020 --> 16:54.660]  bombing Los Angeles, bombing Chicago, bombing Austin, Texas, bombing Houston, shooting people
[16:54.660 --> 17:00.820]  in the streets. Because they're getting nuked and attacked, and the globalist will push
[17:00.820 --> 17:07.380]  the plunger, boom, tactical nuke, say Iran did it. And then it's martial law, so hardcore,
[17:07.380 --> 17:08.820]  it's gonna make your head spin.
[17:08.820 --> 17:12.300]  And you're gonna be ordered to turn your guns in. You're gonna be ordered to swear an oath
[17:12.300 --> 17:16.780]  to them. And you're gonna see all the spies they've hired and all the control freaks and
[17:16.780 --> 17:22.900]  all the intelligence units activated on you. And lots of televised SWAT teams killing,
[17:22.900 --> 17:29.020]  quote, right wing extremists and lots of military bases being attacked by the globalists themselves,
[17:29.020 --> 17:34.620]  blamed on domestic groups claiming we work with Al-Qaeda and Iran.
[17:34.620 --> 17:41.140]  This is the full spectrum warfare of the bankers running America. And once they trigger this
[17:41.140 --> 17:45.740]  war, ladies and gentlemen, it's gonna be a war on the American people and a war on the
[17:45.740 --> 17:52.820]  Iranians. You better believe it, and it is gonna be hellish. Now I'm telling you, this
[17:52.820 --> 18:00.460]  is in the works, in the cards. What I've told you is a very possible scenario that I can
[18:00.460 --> 18:03.300]  see and reverse engineer from all their action.
[18:03.300 --> 18:08.140]  And I know they've got everything I just said in blueprint model battle plans right now.
[18:08.140 --> 18:13.940]  I just gave you one of their major battle plans right there. Because everything in intelligence
[18:13.940 --> 18:17.940]  is watching movements, and the globalist think you're stupid, so they hide everything in
[18:17.940 --> 18:26.300]  plain view. And about 90% of my prime projection I just gave you is open source information.
[18:26.300 --> 18:30.660]  The rest is knowing the enemy's mind. But they could go with a bio attack and say the
[18:30.660 --> 18:36.140]  Iranians did it, or just say one popped up during this crisis to get us all to unify
[18:36.140 --> 18:38.420]  behind the government.
[18:38.420 --> 18:42.500]  What did they talk about in the New Hampshire debate, the one I watched Saturday night?
[18:42.500 --> 18:47.100]  They kept talking about we need to get the public trust back. It's all about making them
[18:47.100 --> 18:52.420]  look trustworthy and making them look good and fatherly and nice. Those are all little
[18:52.420 --> 19:01.180]  nobody puppets except Ron Paul. That's why it's anybody but Ron Paul.
[19:01.180 --> 19:06.740]  So I want you to understand, I told you they'd implode Europe over a decade ago through derivatives
[19:06.740 --> 19:12.580]  and use the EU bureaucracy to fully take what sovereignty was left. Boom, it's happening.
[19:12.580 --> 19:18.020]  Bank of the World being announced, every major magazine that's in financial news, this establishment,
[19:18.020 --> 19:22.220]  Economist, Bloomberg, you name it, saying technocrats, unelected, need to run things
[19:22.220 --> 19:23.220]  now.
[19:23.220 --> 19:28.940]  Freedom isn't good, the Constitution's bad. Time Magazine, Newsweek, they're selling tyranny
[19:28.940 --> 19:37.860]  as the answer right now. And I know their plan. I told you 10 years ago they start putting
[19:37.860 --> 19:42.860]  TSA on the streets. Now it's being announced and being done all over the country. You drive
[19:42.860 --> 19:47.020]  up, there's guys with machine guns searching your cars, searching you on the street.
[19:47.020 --> 19:52.460]  They're beta testing total martial law, and they're gonna start a civil war. They want
[19:52.460 --> 19:56.980]  a civil war. They're gonna march the idiots and Homeland Security up against the American
[19:56.980 --> 19:59.580]  people. We'll be right back.
[19:59.580 --> 20:08.140]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[20:08.140 --> 20:12.060]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[20:12.060 --> 20:19.020]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[20:19.020 --> 20:20.020]  your help.

[20:25.260 --> 20:31.780]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[20:31.780 --> 20:37.380]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[20:37.380 --> 20:44.640]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[20:44.640 --> 20:52.300]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[20:52.300 --> 21:00.580]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[21:29.620 --> 21:33.820]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[21:33.820 --> 21:38.940]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[21:38.940 --> 21:43.500]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet
[21:43.500 --> 21:50.100]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[21:50.100 --> 21:55.940]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure
[21:55.940 --> 22:03.300]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[22:03.300 --> 22:06.740]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[22:06.740 --> 22:11.060]  like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it look like someone
[22:11.060 --> 22:15.860]  is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a small electronic device that
[22:15.860 --> 22:19.980]  makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home
[22:19.980 --> 22:24.700]  watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing
[22:24.700 --> 22:29.980]  to burglars. Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended
[22:29.980 --> 22:34.020]  by numerous police departments. Use it any time you're away from home. To order your
[22:34.020 --> 22:42.140]  fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. Each additional fake
[22:42.140 --> 22:47.540]  TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security,
[22:47.540 --> 22:57.220]  and peace of mind for both of you. Call 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. faketv.com. The burglar
[22:57.220 --> 23:00.140]  deterrent.

[24:00.740 --> 24:05.940]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[24:05.940 --> 24:13.780]  Now in the midst of a huge confrontation with Iran coming up, Iran says they take it as
[24:13.780 --> 24:19.700]  a military attack if they are put under siege of their industrial civilization. A lot of
[24:19.700 --> 24:25.540]  areas of Iran look like Chicago or Dallas, Texas, big, glistening, high-rise buildings.
[24:25.540 --> 24:30.620]  People in suits and ties walking around. About 70%, if you look at the general polls of Iranians
[24:30.620 --> 24:42.120]  are big fans of the U.S., but they're going to be attacked. And they're saying that when
[24:42.120 --> 24:46.660]  their power gets cut off, they are gonna go ahead and block the Strait of Hormuz and give
[24:46.660 --> 24:49.740]  Europe and the U.S. the same medicine they're getting.
[24:49.740 --> 24:53.380]  And the Israelis in the U.S. have said, that is the people that run Israel and run the
[24:53.380 --> 24:58.340]  United States have said, you know what, we're gonna attack you when you do that. It's like,
[24:58.340 --> 25:03.060]  we're gonna cut your power off, and we're gonna have terrorists inside your country.
[25:03.060 --> 25:11.740]  I even have a Washington Post article today admitting that the U.S. and Israel are blowing
[25:11.740 --> 25:18.100]  up missile bases and assassinating people in Iran. I mean, whole bases blow up. Whole
[25:18.100 --> 25:24.300]  military command bases blow up. Whole missile bases blow up. Ahmadinejad's driving across
[25:24.300 --> 25:25.300]  a bridge.
[25:25.300 --> 25:28.780]  It blows up right after he drives across it. The Iranians, they were so crazy. They're
[25:28.780 --> 25:33.100]  just taking it and taking it and taking it and taking it. But they're saying if you cut
[25:33.100 --> 25:40.100]  off half our power, we're gonna have to go to war with you. Because siege, embargo, blockade
[25:40.100 --> 25:44.680]  is the oldest form of war. Under international law, Ron Paul has pointed out it's an act
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.620]  of war. Can you imagine if somebody cut off half our fuel?
[25:48.620 --> 25:54.940]  I mean, folks, a lot of the average good old boys, liquor sales, pizza sales go off the
[25:54.940 --> 25:59.420]  charts when there's a war. More than New Year's and Christmas and Thanksgiving combined. I've
[25:59.420 --> 26:03.220]  talked to liquor store owners. I've seen the statistics in the news. When there's a new
[26:03.220 --> 26:09.540]  war, people go get drunk, they have barbecues, they sit there like it's a video game.
[26:09.540 --> 26:14.500]  As the banks that run America use our military to terrorize third world nations, of course
[26:14.500 --> 26:19.860]  they hate us. And then they say, well, if we weren't dependent on oil, we wouldn't have
[26:19.860 --> 26:24.640]  to buy it from them. All the Republicans say that. The big oil companies and banks that
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.900]  run this country don't want the oil to be developed.
[26:29.900 --> 26:35.500]  They're always blocking it. It isn't some little hippie person blocking exploration
[26:35.500 --> 26:42.040]  of oil. It's the big oil companies, it's on record. The Associated Press sued in 2000
[26:42.040 --> 26:49.900]  and got documents from 1996. We've written big articles on it, where the big 10 oil companies
[26:49.900 --> 26:53.780]  got together in meetings and said, we gotta buy up all the refineries, there's too much
[26:53.780 --> 26:54.780]  oil.
[26:54.780 --> 27:00.100]  We'll shut it down that way. And we'll also basically covertly fund environmentalist groups
[27:00.100 --> 27:06.300]  to stop development here to shut down all the smaller companies. It's on record. And
[27:06.300 --> 27:11.660]  they fund the whole peak oil thing the oil companies do, there's no oil left. To train
[27:11.660 --> 27:15.220]  you that there's no oil, just like they're shutting down all of our coal plants that
[27:15.220 --> 27:21.460]  aren't owned by GE and the power prices are going off the charts.
[27:21.460 --> 27:26.820]  They know what they're doing. They'd like to sell you less for a whole lot more. And
[27:26.820 --> 27:33.740]  it's real simple. It's real simple. The globalists are gonna love it. Saudi Arabia's already
[27:33.740 --> 27:36.980]  said they're gonna love it when the strait gets shut down. They're gonna make even more
[27:36.980 --> 27:41.300]  money. You're gonna pay a lot more, you're gonna pay $6, $7 at the pump and they're gonna
[27:41.300 --> 27:43.500]  tell you Iran did it.
[27:43.500 --> 27:47.960]  You think the Iranians are like paying two, three times at the pump? They're human beings
[27:47.960 --> 27:55.020]  too. Now let's go to this clip. Here's CBS News. It's got a thing with McCain worshiping,
[27:55.020 --> 28:01.900]  anti-God, open border McCain, carbon tax McCain, torture lover McCain, who said he was for
[28:01.900 --> 28:04.100]  torture, but voted for it.
[28:04.100 --> 28:09.020]  Against torture, but voted for it. Here it is, CBS reporter blatantly excludes Ron Paul
[28:09.020 --> 28:14.500]  from coverage, despite the fact that Paul is surging and Romney sliding. Yeah, Romney's
[28:14.500 --> 28:19.100]  sliding in New Hampshire, that's what all the polls show. Paul is 8 to 15 points depending
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.100]  on which poll.
[28:20.100 --> 28:27.900]  And look, it's gonna show the graphic, CBS News. CBS News won't even tell, won't even
[28:27.900 --> 28:33.100]  tell their viewers Ron Paul exist. They think you're idiots. This is the disdain of these
[28:33.100 --> 28:35.060]  people. Here's the clip.
[28:35.060 --> 28:40.620]  And that is to make sure that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States
[28:40.620 --> 28:42.660]  of America.
[28:42.660 --> 28:47.460]  Expectations are high in what has become Romney's adopted home state. The New Suffolk University
[28:47.460 --> 28:53.300]  poll shows him with a commanding lead in New Hampshire at almost 30 points above his rivals.
[28:53.300 --> 28:59.260]  At the same time, Newt Gingrich and Jon Huntsman have faltered. Rick Santorum, who polls in
[28:59.260 --> 29:04.620]  single digits here, is looking to give Romney a run in the Granite State after his near
[29:04.620 --> 29:06.740]  victory in Iowa.
[29:06.740 --> 29:07.740]  As for the-
[29:07.740 --> 29:10.700]  Okay, back that up for a minute with the graphic there. I'm gonna have that redone. We grabbed
[29:10.700 --> 29:14.340]  that CBS and put our graphic around it, but it cuts off the numbers there. I'm gonna show
[29:14.340 --> 29:17.980]  this on the nightly news again tonight, it's big news, but there's the full graphic. Romney
[29:17.980 --> 29:23.020]  43, Gingrich 9, Huntsman 7, Santorum 6.
[29:23.020 --> 29:29.740]  They don't even let you know there that 20 something percent is Ron Paul and they don't
[29:29.740 --> 29:35.900]  even show him. This is how they manage reality. This is why your neighbors seem so dumb. This
[29:35.900 --> 29:40.340]  is why they're so ignorant. I run into a lot of people still don't even know who Ron Paul
[29:40.340 --> 29:47.000]  is. So yes, those of us that can see, that are awake, we know all about it, but the average
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.900]  person is literally sucking their thumb.
[29:49.900 --> 30:04.900]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:04.900 --> 30:09.500]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[30:09.500 --> 30:12.180]  It really says that the state is God.
[30:12.180 --> 30:16.720]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[30:16.720 --> 30:22.300]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[30:22.300 --> 30:27.740]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[30:27.740 --> 30:32.500]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[30:32.500 --> 30:37.800]  depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[30:37.800 --> 30:43.780]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
[30:43.780 --> 30:48.860]  every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The
[30:48.860 --> 30:55.540]  police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it

[31:07.780 --> 31:13.500]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down
[31:13.500 --> 31:25.380]  in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They sew pride in every stitch,
[31:25.380 --> 31:32.620]  guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you
[31:32.620 --> 31:41.980]  need it most. Blue diamond gusset's got it, others don't. We turn jeans inside out. Diamond
[31:41.980 --> 31:48.020]  gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our defender motorcycle jeans combine

[32:01.220 --> 32:05.820]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[32:05.820 --> 32:10.300]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy
[32:10.300 --> 32:14.860]  czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's
[32:14.860 --> 32:20.300]  true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.300 --> 32:24.620]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.620 --> 32:29.980]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather
[32:29.980 --> 32:34.360]  is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[32:34.360 --> 32:39.540]  weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[32:39.540 --> 32:43.420]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions
[32:43.420 --> 32:49.980]  from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[32:49.980 --> 32:55.740]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun. So go to mysolarbackup.com
[32:55.740 --> 33:07.340]  or call 1-877-327-0365. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[33:07.340 --> 33:14.340]  Show.
[33:14.340 --> 33:31.300]  Okay, we are joined by Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer to break down more on Iran,
[33:31.300 --> 33:37.540]  then investigative journalist, former NSA Officer Wayne Madsen, and will be joining
[33:37.540 --> 33:43.100]  us as well to break this down. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer currently serves
[33:43.100 --> 33:47.420]  as the Director of External Communications of the Center for Advanced Defense Studies
[33:47.420 --> 33:48.420]  as a consultant.
[33:48.420 --> 33:53.920]  He is a senior operations officer, military operations training course, MOTC, and he just
[33:53.920 --> 34:00.040]  goes through all the combat he's been in, Afghanistan, you name it. The Stratus Ivy
[34:00.040 --> 34:03.580]  Group trying to kill bin Laden, who could have killed him but was blocked from doing
[34:03.580 --> 34:09.300]  it right before 9-11. Abel Danger is testimony to Congress. He awarded the Bronze Star for
[34:09.300 --> 34:11.780]  his first of two combat tours in Afghanistan.
[34:11.780 --> 34:16.300]  He was credited for conducting highly complex operational support of NSA and for playing
[34:16.300 --> 34:22.260]  a critical role in breaking the back of the Taliban counter-offensive in fall of 03. In
[34:22.260 --> 34:27.340]  addition, he was called back to active duty in Desert Storm, Desert Shield in 91, performed
[34:27.340 --> 34:32.180]  special support to Army Intelligence. He's been deployed to Thailand, Germany, New Zealand,
[34:32.180 --> 34:37.780]  and much more. OperationDarkHeart.com is where you can find out about his best-selling
[34:37.780 --> 34:44.940]  book that got pulled for a while when the government cut some pieces out of it.
[34:44.940 --> 34:48.820]  Really just as a dirty trick as much of what he talked about had already been documented,
[34:48.820 --> 34:53.840]  but he joins us for the next 30 minutes to look at Iran. A lot of analysts have said
[34:53.840 --> 34:58.500]  this could lead to World War III. The Chinese have said, their president said, prepare for
[34:58.500 --> 35:04.060]  war with the United States. They've said they will back them militarily. They said they'll
[35:04.060 --> 35:05.580]  back Pakistan militarily.
[35:05.580 --> 35:09.500]  The question is, will they follow through on that? China needs that oil, has a lot of
[35:09.500 --> 35:15.140]  projects there. They're the ones helping them build reactors. And for those that don't know,
[35:15.140 --> 35:20.940]  who just tuned in, Debca file Reuters, Jerusalem Post. I mean, I've got like 50 articles here,
[35:20.940 --> 35:30.060]  no exaggeration. Russian-French warships off Syria, Iran, US drones over Iranian coast.
[35:30.060 --> 35:34.240]  Iran has ability to block trade of Hormuz. US General Dempsey tells CBS three weeks ago
[35:34.240 --> 35:41.700]  he said they couldn't. Breaking with Admiral Mullen, the last Joint Chiefs, and before
[35:41.700 --> 35:46.240]  that Fox Fallon, who of course were Navy men, admirals.
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.320]  So a lot of weird stuff out of Dempsey, I'll tell you. If he's gonna say they can't block
[35:51.320 --> 35:55.740]  it, he should just stick with it, even if it's wrong. But Iran reported to enrich uranium
[35:55.740 --> 36:00.580]  and underground lab, all of that's going on. Judy Miller alert, the New York Times is lying
[36:00.580 --> 36:04.580]  about Iran's nuclear program again, implying they're enriching weapons grade when it's
[36:04.580 --> 36:05.900]  documented that they're not.
[36:05.900 --> 36:10.800]  Here's another one, Iran to launch nuclear work again in that bunker. All of this is
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.420]  just getting crazier and crazier. And here's the biggest news from my perspective, we're
[36:14.420 --> 36:20.380]  going to Colonel Shaver. They're saying that they will block the Strait of Hormuz now in
[36:20.380 --> 36:27.940]  official Iranian press TV, official government organs, if the embargo by Europe goes ahead
[36:27.940 --> 36:32.140]  of Iranian oil, which is how they fund most of their government.
[36:32.140 --> 36:38.080]  And they're saying they're gonna embargo refined gas, they sell raw oil and then buy refined
[36:38.080 --> 36:44.940]  gasoline 51%. So this is an industrial depression for them. So the people that want war have
[36:44.940 --> 36:49.940]  pushed them into this, and we're here, this is a big deal. And Europe's set to vote in
[36:49.940 --> 36:53.780]  less than three weeks on this, but that's not even the biggest news.
[36:53.780 --> 37:02.420]  We have the, and I have trouble not hyperventilating when I think about this because this is crazy,
[37:02.420 --> 37:08.300]  they have the US fleet, an Israeli fleet, the Associated Press report steaming towards
[37:08.300 --> 37:13.380]  the Strait of Hormuz after Iran last week issued a challenge that do not come to the
[37:13.380 --> 37:17.380]  Strait again, this is your last warning.
[37:17.380 --> 37:25.420]  So that wild provocation by Iran and Israel, the United States going in, so either they're
[37:25.420 --> 37:29.740]  gonna blink or something's gonna happen. How did things escalate this fast, Lieutenant
[37:29.740 --> 37:32.580]  Colonel Anthony Schafer, sir?
[37:32.580 --> 37:36.740]  Well, I think there's three things that we have to consider as we look to the future.
[37:36.740 --> 37:45.740]  First, as you brought out, and I think very well stated, the Iranians have huge problems
[37:45.740 --> 37:51.500]  inside if they decide to do the blockade, because they do it, they are a net importer
[37:51.500 --> 37:54.060]  of gasoline, their economy depends on that.
[37:54.060 --> 38:00.820]  Secondly, no matter how much they save a rattle, and look, I gotta tell you, Alex, we could
[38:00.820 --> 38:06.780]  take care of the Iranian Navy in a matter of hours, and I'm not exaggerating, despite
[38:06.780 --> 38:14.460]  the fact that there's a lot of, I think, conflicting information, look, we've got a carrier sitting
[38:14.460 --> 38:18.140]  in there right now, we don't need more than a couple of carriers take care of what would
[38:18.140 --> 38:19.140]  be necessary.
[38:19.140 --> 38:23.940]  With that said, we have to understand the huge consequences of that action regarding
[38:23.940 --> 38:24.940]  our own economy.
[38:24.940 --> 38:30.740]  This is a fragile recovery, some would argue it's barely moving forward, and I don't think
[38:30.740 --> 38:35.420]  anybody wants five dollar gallons of gas, but that's what would happen the moment we
[38:35.420 --> 38:40.460]  actually have something happen to interfere with, I think, arguably, you're talking about
[38:40.460 --> 38:42.620]  one third of the oil going through the Straits of Ramon.
[38:42.620 --> 38:47.340]  Now, keep in mind that we're down to about 16% of our incoming oil comes out of that
[38:47.340 --> 38:52.860]  region, mostly out of OPEC countries, which are friendly to us, with that said, the cost
[38:52.860 --> 38:56.660]  of doing business with gas, with, you know, with crew to go up.
[38:56.660 --> 39:01.340]  Secondly, the Iranians themselves, I think, are trying to do things, and I said this in
[39:01.340 --> 39:06.100]  a recent interview, which got a lot of additional air time, the Iranians understand how to push
[39:06.100 --> 39:09.380]  our buttons, because they've watched the North Koreans do it very effectively.
[39:09.380 --> 39:14.980]  One would call it brinksmanship, where the North Koreans have been able to walk us up
[39:14.980 --> 39:18.140]  to a line, poke us in the eye, and step back.
[39:18.140 --> 39:21.180]  I think the Iranians have noted how to do that.
[39:21.180 --> 39:23.340]  So the question becomes, do we blink?
[39:23.340 --> 39:26.060]  Do we actually get into them like we've done the North Koreans in the past?
[39:26.060 --> 39:30.740]  I think the Iranians are trying to push our, you know, push us right to that level of will
[39:30.740 --> 39:32.460]  you back down or not.
[39:32.460 --> 39:37.220]  The third issue, I think, is one we have to consider very carefully, is the Iranian people.
[39:37.220 --> 39:41.740]  The Iranian people, for the most part, are pro-reform.
[39:41.740 --> 39:46.940]  They are essentially a people under the repressive regime of these mullahs who have kept them
[39:46.940 --> 39:48.920]  down since the 79.
[39:48.920 --> 39:50.900]  So the people themselves are pro-U.S.
[39:50.900 --> 39:55.260]  We need to do everything we can to prompt the Iranian people to move forward in a positive
[39:55.260 --> 39:57.020]  way to change their own government.
[39:57.020 --> 40:02.620]  Frankly, our taking military action to this point may well make them our adversary as
[40:02.620 --> 40:03.620]  well.
[40:03.620 --> 40:06.060]  What we need to do is walk the line here to not give in to the Iranian government, but
[40:06.060 --> 40:09.620]  at the same time encourage the Iranian people to do what's best for them and the rest of
[40:09.620 --> 40:14.420]  the world to move forward with pushing their radical regime out and doing something to
[40:14.420 --> 40:17.060]  join the rest of the West free world.
[40:17.060 --> 40:22.540]  Well, obviously, just with aircraft at high altitudes, they can target with precision
[40:22.540 --> 40:25.460]  guided munitions and take out most of those boats.
[40:25.460 --> 40:30.660]  But then when ships come by, there's all sorts of missiles hidden by the tens of thousands,
[40:30.660 --> 40:34.620]  as you know, in those hills overlooking that.
[40:34.620 --> 40:40.140]  And when the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dempsey, comes out and says, okay, they can
[40:40.140 --> 40:45.260]  block the strait from the intel and the research, cuz I know you're really an Iranian expert.
[40:45.260 --> 40:47.040]  How are they planning to block it?
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.460]  Just send a bunch of barges out and sink them or sink other ships that are coming through?
[40:51.460 --> 40:57.740]  Oh, they'd have to do something with large ships, the large container ships and fuel
[40:57.740 --> 40:58.740]  ships.
[40:58.740 --> 40:59.740]  That's the only way they could do it.
[40:59.740 --> 41:03.140]  Now, the whole idea of having these small weapons hidden within the mountains and hills,
[41:03.140 --> 41:04.140]  yeah, I get that.
[41:04.140 --> 41:07.460]  But we have very sophisticated technology which could take that out.
[41:07.460 --> 41:11.780]  And frankly, look, if you choose carpet bombing the coast, that's not unheard of.
[41:11.780 --> 41:13.260]  And I think we could take out a lot of that.
[41:13.260 --> 41:17.820]  What they'd have to do is smaller boats focused on some of these large tankers.
[41:17.820 --> 41:20.780]  So we can't be everywhere we need to be regarding the large tankers.
[41:20.780 --> 41:21.780]  That's something they would do.
[41:21.780 --> 41:24.940]  And you're an expert in this, Alex, asymmetrical warfare.
[41:24.940 --> 41:29.620]  They would look at the seams within our own defense, where we can't be, they would go.
[41:29.620 --> 41:33.780]  And so we can't hope to actually protect every single ship going in and out of there.
[41:33.780 --> 41:36.380]  Therefore, we're going to have to go under the radar, so to speak.
[41:36.380 --> 41:40.020]  So I think that they've done, they've been very effective, it's called boat operations.
[41:40.020 --> 41:44.660]  Frankly, I've talked to folks on the inside and they're worried to death about these small
[41:44.660 --> 41:49.500]  rubber boats that they can't see coming, that could do all sorts of things to large tankers
[41:49.500 --> 41:50.500]  that we can't prevent.
[41:50.500 --> 41:53.980]  So I think clearly they would be trying to do exactly what you're proposing here, so
[41:53.980 --> 41:56.460]  that it was kind of under the radar thing.
[41:56.460 --> 42:02.260]  With that said, I think that there's things that could be done in other parts of, against
[42:02.260 --> 42:04.100]  their infrastructure, which would matter.
[42:04.100 --> 42:08.820]  But again, the military solution would require eventually, and I'm going to say this, people
[42:08.820 --> 42:11.020]  are going to like it, boots on the ground in some form.
[42:11.020 --> 42:14.940]  You can only do so much remotely, you can only do so much with drones, you can only
[42:14.940 --> 42:16.940]  do so much with airframes.
[42:16.940 --> 42:20.820]  To actually be effective, you've got to put boots on the ground, either special operations
[42:20.820 --> 42:24.220]  guys or military forces of some sort, to sort things out internally.
[42:24.220 --> 42:31.940]  And this is the problem with the inside of Iran, like we don't have, or they've hidden
[42:31.940 --> 42:32.940]  everything.
[42:32.940 --> 42:33.940]  To be effective, they're-
[42:33.940 --> 42:39.100]  I tell you what, Colonel Shaffer, stay there, your cell phone's been great.
[42:39.100 --> 42:42.660]  I know we got you on short notice, but it's breaking up a bit.
[42:42.660 --> 42:47.660]  Let's give it a pause for a moment and see if your cell phone reception comes back here.
[42:47.660 --> 42:52.900]  Can you hear me now?
[42:52.900 --> 42:53.900]  Colonel Shaffer, can you hear me?
[42:53.900 --> 42:54.900]  Yeah, can you hear me now?
[42:54.900 --> 42:58.700]  Okay, great, yeah, you started cutting out after you talked about boots on the ground.
[42:58.700 --> 43:02.540]  Yeah, well, basically, we've got to consider the fact that to be effective, you've got
[43:02.540 --> 43:04.860]  to go into the interior in some form.
[43:04.860 --> 43:11.500]  And so, to do that, you've got to have special operations guys or somebody there to physically
[43:11.500 --> 43:16.860]  check things out, because they, the Iranians, know how to manipulate how they appear to
[43:16.860 --> 43:20.380]  our, what we call ISR, our collection systems.
[43:20.380 --> 43:26.380]  And again, if we're looking at actually being effective in going out after targets, I'm
[43:26.380 --> 43:31.140]  told there's 300 targets we would have to take out to be effective in going after the
[43:31.140 --> 43:32.140]  nuclear program.
[43:32.140 --> 43:35.300]  I just don't think we have that level of capability.
[43:35.300 --> 43:41.020]  And then, plus, you have secondary effects of the economic disaster that would be caused
[43:41.020 --> 43:43.300]  by an actual armed conflict with the Iranians.
[43:43.300 --> 43:47.500]  So I think both sides, I'd like to believe, are only saber rattling.
[43:47.500 --> 43:52.900]  I think both sides understand the huge consequences of military action that would hurt both sides
[43:52.900 --> 43:53.900]  immensely.
[43:53.900 --> 44:00.500]  We're going to pull this article up, Colonel Shaffer, but a few weeks ago, the head of
[44:00.500 --> 44:07.140]  Iranian intelligence for their parliament said that the attack would be taken to Tel
[44:07.140 --> 44:12.300]  Aviv and New York with asymmetrical, I guess, sleeper cells.
[44:12.300 --> 44:16.820]  From your research on Iran, do they have the capability to do that?
[44:16.820 --> 44:23.180]  And why would Iran go from not saber rattling to really saying, okay, your ships come back
[44:23.180 --> 44:24.540]  through, we're gonna attack them.
[44:24.540 --> 44:26.420]  Okay, we'll attack you in New York.
[44:26.420 --> 44:30.780]  I mean, that's really asking for it to say that they're gonna attack Tel Aviv and New
[44:30.780 --> 44:31.780]  York.
[44:31.780 --> 44:32.780]  I agree.
[44:32.780 --> 44:38.100]  And that's where I don't think that the Iranians are willing to go to that level of asymmetric
[44:38.100 --> 44:39.100]  warfare against us.
[44:39.100 --> 44:41.780]  To answer your first question, Alex, do I believe they have cells?
[44:41.780 --> 44:43.340]  Yes, I do.
[44:43.340 --> 44:49.380]  The Quds Force and the IRGC are very effective, very sophisticated organizations.
[44:49.380 --> 44:53.320]  However, and you know I talked about this last interview, I don't think they're as hand-handed
[44:53.320 --> 45:00.260]  to do the assassination of the Saudi Arabian ambassador here as was purported.
[45:00.260 --> 45:02.780]  I just don't think that's sloppy.
[45:02.780 --> 45:07.420]  But with that said then, I don't think they're willing to go to a use of these capabilities
[45:07.420 --> 45:11.420]  at this point in time because, frankly, they've been gaining everything they need to continue
[45:11.420 --> 45:17.180]  to develop their nuclear program and work to destabilize the Middle East through their
[45:17.180 --> 45:18.180]  own methods.
[45:18.180 --> 45:22.180]  So why would you change your game plan if you're actually being effective in doing what
[45:22.180 --> 45:30.500]  you want to, to continue to create your nuclear program and be effective in defending the
[45:30.500 --> 45:37.740]  Syrians, because that's part of their deal, they're trying to defend the Assad government.
[45:37.740 --> 45:38.740]  So why would they change?
[45:38.740 --> 45:40.020]  I don't think that they actually do.
[45:40.020 --> 45:43.580]  They're going to be very effective in doing what they can, and I don't think they're going
[45:43.580 --> 45:45.620]  to go past saber-railing at this point in time.
[45:45.620 --> 45:46.620]  Well, that's good news.
[45:46.620 --> 45:50.580]  So then what do you make, I mean obviously you can't tell us anything that's classified,
[45:50.580 --> 45:54.740]  but most people I've talked to in the military, high and low, say Israel's gonna attack, it's
[45:54.740 --> 45:56.140]  only a question of when.
[45:56.140 --> 46:00.340]  We have US troops being sent into Israel right now for missile tests.
[46:00.340 --> 46:04.340]  Well, Alex, I don't know if you can hear me, I'm getting some static, but I think that
[46:04.340 --> 46:08.260]  it's very clear that the Iranians don't know.
[46:08.260 --> 46:18.540]  Yeah, that's strange, his phone got broken in on, that was a cell phone, we got him short
[46:18.540 --> 46:20.540]  notice, we'll get him back on the line.
[46:20.540 --> 46:30.380]  But I was gonna get into Ron Paul, the Huntsman campaign ran an ad making fun of Ron Paul
[46:30.380 --> 46:35.380]  talking about Israel founding Hamas, even though that's in the Jerusalem Post, Herat's
[46:35.380 --> 46:39.060]  Associated Press, that's not debatable.
[46:39.060 --> 46:44.820]  And they've also been criticizing him for going along with what the last two Chairman
[46:44.820 --> 46:47.540]  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
[46:47.540 --> 46:52.060]  What the Secretary of Defense says, what the head of the bin Laden unit says, what Colonel
[46:52.060 --> 47:01.740]  Shaffer says, that it is not a good idea to attack Iran.
[47:01.740 --> 47:08.140]  I mean, even most of the establishment people say don't do it.
[47:08.140 --> 47:13.480]  Most of them say don't do it.
[47:13.480 --> 47:25.860]  And they are really trying to start this war up right now.
[47:25.860 --> 47:34.100]  So my question for him is gonna be, is the word he's getting, I mean, is this leaning
[47:34.100 --> 47:35.820]  more and more towards war?
[47:35.820 --> 47:42.220]  I mean, obviously it is, you've got Iran bluffing, or maybe they're bluffing.
[47:42.220 --> 47:47.340]  And the question is, will the Israeli and US ships stage some type of Gulf of Tonkin?
[47:47.340 --> 47:48.740]  Or will there be an accident?
[47:48.740 --> 47:54.380]  Colonel, I don't know how much of that last question you heard before your line got broken
[47:54.380 --> 47:55.580]  into and cut off, but-
[47:55.580 --> 47:56.580]  Go ahead.
[47:56.580 --> 48:03.380]  Well, it sounds like we've got a better connection now.
[48:03.380 --> 48:04.380]  What's the bottom line?
[48:04.380 --> 48:07.060]  I mean, are things accelerating towards war?
[48:07.060 --> 48:10.680]  Or is this just more of the same, because all my military sources say Israel's going
[48:10.680 --> 48:11.680]  to strike them.
[48:11.680 --> 48:12.680]  My question is, when?
[48:12.680 --> 48:16.140]  Well, and that's the issue, I think, of the day.
[48:16.140 --> 48:20.380]  The Israelis still don't understand, or I don't think we know, if our government would
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.380]  back them up on it.
[48:21.380 --> 48:28.380]  I think there's been a great deal of ambivalence, to use a word, from our own White House regarding
[48:28.380 --> 48:29.580]  what they would do on this.
[48:29.580 --> 48:34.220]  And I'm not sure if this is by design or by the fact they just don't know what to do.
[48:34.220 --> 48:40.560]  Look, the White House was asking as late as a couple days before New Year's about getting
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.060]  assessments of what would happen if we go to war over the straits, regarding the economic
[48:46.060 --> 48:47.060]  question.
[48:47.060 --> 48:50.980]  So, I just don't know how the White House is viewing all this, and I think the Israelis
[48:50.980 --> 48:54.300]  are getting the same kind of, we don't know what's going to happen.
[48:54.300 --> 48:59.180]  And the other thing about this, and again, I hear the same thing about the Israelis wanting
[48:59.180 --> 49:04.140]  to go forward, and Alex, you probably noted they actually tested the Jericho II missile
[49:04.140 --> 49:07.100]  back in December, which, by the way, just for you listeners to understand, that is a
[49:07.100 --> 49:08.500]  nuclear-capable weapon.
[49:08.500 --> 49:13.660]  And that was no accident, they actually chose to do the test launch of that, because there's
[49:13.660 --> 49:18.340]  rumors that I'm hearing also that the Israelis, that they feel that they really are going
[49:18.340 --> 49:23.380]  to be threatened, may go ahead and do a first-strike of nuclear weapons, which would be obviously
[49:23.380 --> 49:28.100]  very bold, very dramatic, but this will be the consequence of them not, you know, knowing
[49:28.100 --> 49:31.100]  if we're going to back them up or not, because they may feel that their back is against the
[49:31.100 --> 49:32.980]  wall and have to take direct action.
[49:32.980 --> 49:37.460]  So that's what, you know, we, a lot of folks do believe it, I do believe it, but I think
[49:37.460 --> 49:41.340]  the big question is, to the Israelis and to others, will we back them up or not?
[49:41.340 --> 49:45.740]  That's something I don't think anybody really knows.
[49:45.740 --> 49:49.340]  Just incredibly creepy that they've got a bunch of Jericho missiles sitting out there
[49:49.340 --> 49:56.300]  in their silos and out there at their gantries with hundreds of nuclear weapons that Israel's
[49:56.300 --> 49:57.460]  got.
[49:57.460 --> 50:03.040]  And how is Israel going to try to sell that politically if they preemptively nuke somebody
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.140]  after all these decades denying they have nukes, denying the elephant in the room, and
[50:07.140 --> 50:12.380]  even if they release their strategic oil supply, there's going to be a chain reaction worldwide
[50:12.380 --> 50:14.460]  that's going to cause speculation to go crazy.
[50:14.460 --> 50:17.260]  They're talking about $7 a gallon gas, Colonel.
[50:17.260 --> 50:18.260]  Right, exactly.
[50:18.260 --> 50:20.260]  And this is the issue of uncertainty.
[50:20.260 --> 50:26.020]  This is one of those areas where I think everybody would be better off understanding who's going
[50:26.020 --> 50:27.020]  to do what.
[50:27.020 --> 50:31.860]  I mean, one of the constant criticisms I get from my Facebook friends is, you know, I keep
[50:31.860 --> 50:34.700]  talking about the fact I do strongly believe this is all saber rattling.
[50:34.700 --> 50:38.180]  Well, you know, even when you're saber rattling, people can make mistakes.
[50:38.180 --> 50:42.020]  During the Cold War, we almost went to war with the Soviets three different times because
[50:42.020 --> 50:43.020]  of misunderstanding.
[50:43.020 --> 50:45.700]  So that could well happen here.
[50:45.700 --> 50:49.620]  The biggest thing we can do, Alex, as a nation is be very clear on what we are willing to
[50:49.620 --> 50:50.620]  do.
[50:50.620 --> 50:54.820]  At this point in time, I think I agree with Ron Paul's position most on Iran.
[50:54.820 --> 50:58.740]  I think that he is most common sense, you know, the Iranians will probably end up with
[50:58.740 --> 51:02.140]  a weapon if they don't already have the components they're up.
[51:02.140 --> 51:04.900]  Or you have to look at what's doable.
[51:04.900 --> 51:10.980]  The idea of attacking them at this point based on the secondary and third order of consequences
[51:10.980 --> 51:12.460]  is probably not the best bet.
[51:12.460 --> 51:16.180]  But at the same time, we've got to have a course of action moving forward which will
[51:16.180 --> 51:21.660]  allow us to protect our allies, and the Israelis aren't feeling like, they feel a lot of love
[51:21.660 --> 51:24.540]  from us when you have Secretary of Defense Panetta, you know, demanding that they get
[51:24.540 --> 51:25.820]  back to the table.
[51:25.820 --> 51:31.500]  So I think a lot of the rhetoric is not well thought, and I think by allowing the rhetoric
[51:31.500 --> 51:38.100]  to be what everybody understands to be the case, we're not really doing a good job of
[51:38.100 --> 51:42.580]  defending our own interests by the fact that we may have others act on our behalf and force
[51:42.580 --> 51:44.060]  us to do things we don't want to do.
[51:44.060 --> 51:47.900]  This is why it's pretty dangerous at the current point.
[51:47.900 --> 51:49.900]  How did China and Russia fit into this?
[51:49.900 --> 51:54.780]  I mean, clearly their posture has gotten the most aggressive it's been since the Cold War.
[51:54.780 --> 51:56.420]  There's a thawing there.
[51:56.420 --> 52:01.420]  I mean, is that one reason Panetta and people are telling Israel, hey, knock it off?
[52:01.420 --> 52:05.620]  Well, I think that both nations have their own interests, and this is one of those things
[52:05.620 --> 52:11.260]  I always tell people, always judge a nation by its own interests, not about what we think
[52:11.260 --> 52:12.260]  they're doing.
[52:12.260 --> 52:15.500]  All nations behave in their own best interests.
[52:15.500 --> 52:20.180]  The Chinese have a very strong relationship with the Iranians, with the Pakistanis, and
[52:20.180 --> 52:23.340]  plus, frankly, they're trying to develop their own influence over the region.
[52:23.340 --> 52:25.900]  So they're going to continue to do things which we don't like.
[52:25.900 --> 52:26.900]  That's the bottom line.
[52:26.900 --> 52:28.440]  The Russians are the same way.
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.740]  The Russians are trying to re-insinuate themselves as a superpower, and they're doing that by
[52:32.740 --> 52:35.660]  essentially what they did during the Cold War, proxy warfare.
[52:35.660 --> 52:39.740]  So we have to understand that these guys will be working with adversaries of ours at every
[52:39.740 --> 52:40.740]  level.
[52:40.740 --> 52:43.340]  So they're doing things behind the scenes, Alex, to do what they've always done, to try
[52:43.340 --> 52:50.140]  to gain advantage over us in such a way that their fingerprints aren't directly on it.
[52:50.140 --> 52:53.460]  The Russians and Chinese both have been helping the Iranians behind the scenes.
[52:53.460 --> 52:55.740]  Let's be brutally honest here.
[52:55.740 --> 52:58.780]  The Iranians would not be as far as they are with their nuclear program without direct
[52:58.780 --> 53:00.780]  support from both the Chinese and Russians.
[53:00.780 --> 53:04.580]  So we have to understand that, and I don't think our own nation, our own government,
[53:04.580 --> 53:08.180]  the White House, has fully understood that even if they talk nice to these folks, they
[53:08.180 --> 53:11.260]  aren't going to listen, and they're going to continue to do things to prompt their own
[53:11.260 --> 53:13.940]  interest behind the scenes.
[53:13.940 --> 53:19.360]  Let's say there's a clock and midnight is a bombardment of Iran, and then all the other
[53:19.360 --> 53:26.180]  horrible things, different things that can come out of that, but all of them are not
[53:26.180 --> 53:27.180]  nice.
[53:27.180 --> 53:29.420]  Clearly, the hands are moving closer to midnight.
[53:29.420 --> 53:30.420]  Right.
[53:30.420 --> 53:32.420]  Well, I think we're at 11 o'clock.
[53:32.420 --> 53:36.340]  I think we're at a solid 11 o'clock, and this is what's going to happen, I believe, very
[53:36.340 --> 53:37.340]  clearly.
[53:37.340 --> 53:42.180]  The thing that's going to prompt the Israelis to act is the moment in time when they believe,
[53:42.180 --> 53:48.100]  and this is going to be key, Alex, they believe, when the Israelis believe the Iranians can
[53:48.100 --> 53:52.860]  mount nuclear weapons onto a delivery system, this is the thing that I think we need to
[53:52.860 --> 53:56.820]  focus on, and this is what I've been talking to my friends about.
[53:56.820 --> 54:02.580]  The Israelis are concerned about the Iranians being able to launch weapons in their direction.
[54:02.580 --> 54:06.100]  The moment that the Israelis feel threatened, that is to say that they think the Iranians
[54:06.100 --> 54:11.360]  can actually put a nuclear weapon, a nuclear tip on a missile, that's when they're going
[54:11.360 --> 54:12.360]  to act.
[54:12.360 --> 54:16.540]  I think it's a foregone conclusion the Iranians are going to have nuclear weapons.
[54:16.540 --> 54:19.940]  I think there's little we can do at this point to prevent that.
[54:19.940 --> 54:23.140]  However, we can do other things to make sure that if they have nuclear weapons, they cannot
[54:23.140 --> 54:24.140]  be used.
[54:24.140 --> 54:27.460]  That's going to be the critical juncture, and I think that moment in time is still a
[54:27.460 --> 54:31.660]  few months off, maybe up to six to eight months before they're going to be able to do that.
[54:31.660 --> 54:36.900]  Some of my military sources say Iran, that they've been given briefings that Iran does
[54:36.900 --> 54:41.780]  have primitive atomic weapons, but is that internal propaganda within the army?
[54:41.780 --> 54:44.500]  No, I believe that to be true.
[54:44.500 --> 54:50.380]  I believe, based on everything I'm told, that there's at least two nuclear weapons.
[54:50.380 --> 54:54.820]  Let us say that there is sufficient fissile material that they can put together, but with
[54:54.820 --> 55:00.860]  that said, they can't be used, they can't deliver them, therefore that is the other
[55:00.860 --> 55:01.860]  thing.
[55:01.860 --> 55:06.460]  Simply having a nuclear weapon doesn't really give you much, you have to be able to use
[55:06.460 --> 55:07.460]  it.
[55:07.460 --> 55:08.460]  It's got to be a credible threat.
[55:08.460 --> 55:11.860]  Sure, and if it doesn't air burst, it just blows a crater in the ground.
[55:11.860 --> 55:12.860]  Right, exactly.
[55:12.860 --> 55:16.420]  So they don't have a credible way of delivering, Alex, and I think, again, that's where we
[55:16.420 --> 55:18.420]  need to look at that.
[55:18.420 --> 55:22.500]  When the Israelis and others believe there's a credible way of delivering a weapon of mass
[55:22.500 --> 55:25.500]  destruction to a target, they don't have that at this point in time, they've been trying
[55:25.500 --> 55:26.500]  to develop that.
[55:26.500 --> 55:30.820]  And I do believe, this is the one area I do agree with Panetta on, I think they're at
[55:30.820 --> 55:33.380]  least eight months to a year away from that.
[55:33.380 --> 55:39.100]  However, I do believe that the horses have left the barn regarding a weapon.
[55:39.100 --> 55:41.100]  I think they have a weapon making-
[55:41.100 --> 55:42.100]  Sure.
[55:42.100 --> 55:48.380]  And you've been very gracious to be with us here, Colonel, specifically looking at what's
[55:48.380 --> 55:50.420]  happening in Iran.
[55:50.420 --> 55:53.940]  How does it tie into Pakistan?
[55:53.940 --> 55:59.860]  What's behind all of these military strikes on Pakistani bases?
[55:59.860 --> 56:01.420]  They're on the border.
[56:01.420 --> 56:08.340]  And if Israel's so worried about Iran having nukes, I mean, from the numbers I've seen,
[56:08.340 --> 56:11.220]  Pakistan's got something like 100 of them in delivery systems?
[56:11.220 --> 56:12.220]  Yes.
[56:12.220 --> 56:18.180]  I can't go into all the details, but there's at least 100 nuclear warheads that Pakistanis
[56:18.180 --> 56:22.660]  have used, developed, let me say something else frightening, they've got enough material
[56:22.660 --> 56:24.940]  to probably create another 100.
[56:24.940 --> 56:26.980]  And the other thing, yes, they have delivery systems.
[56:26.980 --> 56:31.060]  So I can be honest with you, I've been working on task forces looking at this for the past
[56:31.060 --> 56:35.940]  five years, and I think this is a much more worrisome target because if the central Pakistani
[56:35.940 --> 56:40.820]  government falls, they have not only weapons, they have delivery systems for them.
[56:40.820 --> 56:44.140]  And I think that's something we, you know, the current White House doesn't like talking
[56:44.140 --> 56:45.140]  about.
[56:45.140 --> 56:51.220]  And, you know, the radicals within Pakistan continue to make headway in destabilizing
[56:51.220 --> 56:52.220]  that government.
[56:52.220 --> 56:55.660]  So I believe it's only a matter of time before that government becomes essentially a failed
[56:55.660 --> 57:01.660]  state, and you're going to have over-addicular weapons that we will be worried about.
[57:01.660 --> 57:04.580]  And I can tell you that is one thing we are very worried about, the Indians are also worried
[57:04.580 --> 57:05.580]  about that, Alex.
[57:05.580 --> 57:09.860]  I mean, that is a serious issue, one of which I think is as important about more important
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.820]  than the Iranian issue.
[57:11.820 --> 57:15.980]  Well, why doesn't Israel seem concerned about that?
[57:15.980 --> 57:19.260]  Because, I mean, they've got medium-range missiles in Pakistan.
[57:19.260 --> 57:20.820]  Well, that's the thing.
[57:20.820 --> 57:25.140]  I mean, they believe they're trusting us, better for better for worse, and having us
[57:25.140 --> 57:26.140]  deal with the Pakistanis.
[57:26.140 --> 57:29.700]  This is one of those things that I keep talking about regarding Afghanistan.
[57:29.700 --> 57:33.380]  The issue is not Afghanistan, Alex, it's Pakistan, always has been.
[57:33.380 --> 57:36.060]  And this is something I think we continue to pretend otherwise.
[57:36.060 --> 57:40.460]  And this is why, you know, there's been some folks doing a policy review of the region.
[57:40.460 --> 57:43.780]  There'll be some meetings on the Hill next week, which I think you'll probably see some
[57:43.780 --> 57:44.780]  results out of.
[57:44.780 --> 57:48.940]  But frankly, a lot of the folks I talk to understand clearly that the real issue needs
[57:48.940 --> 57:51.060]  to be Pakistan, not Afghanistan.
[57:51.060 --> 57:55.820]  And frankly, you know, the Iranians and what they're doing is important, but we already
[57:55.820 --> 57:59.900]  know that there's a fleet of nuclear weapons, nuclear-tipped missiles, which are available
[57:59.900 --> 58:04.820]  to radicals if they continue to push and destabilize the Pakistan economy.
[58:04.820 --> 58:10.140]  Very briefly, what do you make of the demonization of Ron Paul for pointing out what you and
[58:10.140 --> 58:16.060]  countless other analysts said, that that whole thing with the Iranians wanting to kill the
[58:16.060 --> 58:17.060]  Saudi ambassador?
[58:17.060 --> 58:20.340]  I mean, you're saying that's baloney, they're attacking Ron Paul for that.
[58:20.340 --> 58:22.340]  Let me point out two things to you, Alex.
[58:22.340 --> 58:26.980]  Remember, right when it was announced, they kept saying we're gonna have more information
[58:26.980 --> 58:27.980]  coming out.
[58:27.980 --> 58:29.780]  Well, I'll tell you what, Colonel, will you do five more minutes with us?
[58:29.780 --> 58:30.780]  Yeah, sure.
[58:30.780 --> 58:33.780]  Okay, we're gonna go to break and come back and get into that.
[58:33.780 --> 58:35.180]  So many questions.
[58:35.180 --> 58:40.100]  Regardless, the world's getting into a very crazy position.
[58:40.100 --> 58:47.860]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.860 --> 58:53.180]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[58:53.180 --> 58:58.020]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[58:58.020 --> 58:59.020]  risk.
[58:59.020 --> 59:00.140]  Saving means to make money.
[59:00.140 --> 59:04.340]  The Calvin pure soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[59:04.340 --> 59:09.900]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[59:09.900 --> 59:15.620]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[59:15.620 --> 59:17.300]  or antibacterials.
[59:17.300 --> 59:22.820]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[59:22.820 --> 59:25.200]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[59:25.200 --> 59:28.500]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[59:28.500 --> 59:30.580]  to do something you've never done before.
[59:30.580 --> 59:38.700]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at fivestarsoap.com.

[59:53.540 --> 59:55.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:55.740 --> 01:00:05.260]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:10.100]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.100]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.220]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:30.660]  So there's been an amazing demonization of Ron Paul for reading the newspaper, I guess.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.020]  Jerusalem Post and others admit Israel set up Hamas as a counterbalance to the Iranian
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020]  Hezbollah.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:42.620]  They demonized him in a TV ad, Huntsman did other TV ads saying he's crazy for just saying
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:50.540]  that that plot was obviously made up to have some used car salesman kill the ambassador.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:56.260]  But there were just countless analysts, I mean, not just Colonel Shaffer, on TV.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.540]  The former head of the Bush administration's unit on Iran said it was preposterous.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:05.060]  So I guess the mainstream media counts on people being dumb to sit there and tell them
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.860]  that Ron Paul's crazy when all he's doing is repeating what most of the Joint Chiefs
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:15.340]  of Staff have said, what the former head of the Israeli Mossad said when Netanyahu fired
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.340]  him last year.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:22.740]  I mean, for me, knowing basic news, Ron Paul's just mainline common sense, Colonel Shaffer.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.780]  Let me point out two points to back you up on this.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.780]  First, if you recall, everybody who was supposedly briefed on the classified information on this
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:35.020]  plot said, oh, you're gonna see more coming out over the next few weeks showing that we're
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.020]  correct.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:41.860]  Have you seen a single follow-up article showing that this was true, not a one?
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:48.020]  So that premise, that it was, you know, something more to it, has been proven false by the administration's
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:52.140]  own failure to provide additional clarification and evidence.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.140]  So there you go.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.140]  First point.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.820]  Second point is that, look, I've talked to Bruce Fine.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.460]  I consider Bruce Fine a close friend.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.020]  Bruce is one of Ron Paul's senior advisors.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:07.840]  And from talking to Bruce and others, look, Paul is trying to actually get what he believes
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.900]  out to be what is fact, not what is propaganda, but is fact.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.660]  And I gotta tell you, from talking to Bruce and others, you know, there's no doubt that
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:20.580]  Ron Paul would use military force in a very severe way against our adversaries when you
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.380]  have clear intel indicating that something's going on.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.980]  But Alex, you and I both know the intelligence community has been politicized by whoever
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.980]  is in charge.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.100]  The Bush White House, the Obama White House, doesn't matter.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:36.260]  You have people who are policy types trying to forge intelligence around the policy instead
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.260]  of the other way.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.980]  And I was trying to get it to be where it was, where you take the intel and you make
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.980]  your decisions based on the intel, not on what your wishful thinking based on your political
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980]  perspective is.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.620]  And I think that's what the issue is when it comes to why Ron Paul is getting slammed.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.620]  He certainly is.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:57.460]  I mean, it looks like the media, all the other politicians are getting behind a strike on
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.980]  Iran.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:06.580]  In closing, what's the time frame that we could see this escalate, or briefly, what
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.700]  are a few of the ways that things could get triggered here?
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:15.860]  Well, any miscalculation regarding the military, you could see a exchange of fire which could
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.860]  escalate quickly.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.140]  The thing is, I think the Iranians clearly would still lose in that scenario.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.780]  The Iranians want to have a nuclear weapon system which is deliverable.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.260]  That is something that they could use.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.820]  They're not there yet, Alex.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.220]  So we're talking, I think we're going to see saber rattling for another six months.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:35.220]  We're talking about the fall before the Iranians actually have something that could be used
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.620]  to deliver a nuclear device.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.700]  So I think we're talking about saber rattling through the spring, unless a miscalculation
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.700]  occurs.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.660]  But I think we're going to be revisiting this very seriously towards the fall once a delivery
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.540]  system is available to them.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.740]  So I predict more saber rattling, unless somebody loses their cool and does something bad, at
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.380]  least through the summer.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:57.860]  But right on time, that's the October surprise, and that would help Netanyahu in an election.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.700]  If the war was happening right then, it would help Obama.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.980]  People rally around the government when there's a war, even if the war is a fraud.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:09.500]  In fact, that's the word I'm getting, is that they've been looking at it, but that it could
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.260]  be an October surprise.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.260]  I agree with your assessment, Alex, that could well be the case.
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:18.100]  Wow, well, Colonel Shafer, I look forward to having you back up soon via Skype.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:22.660]  I know you're going to be on with Judge Andrew Napolitano later in the week, breaking this
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:23.660]  down more.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.300]  Operationdarkheart.com, your best-selling book breaking so much of what happened in
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.300]  Afghanistan down.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.100]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.260]  Great, thank you, Alex.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.780]  All right, there it goes.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.300]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer, we're going to come back, hit other news.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:43.060]  Wayne Madsen to give us his perspective on Iran, and he's another very well-read person
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.220]  on that front coming up.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:50.540]  I want to get into some of the election news, Ron Paul news, New World Order news, straight
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]  ahead.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.540]  We'll do that.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.740]  I also want to recap first some of the other Iran news.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:02.180]  Stay with us, we'll be right back, Kurt Nemo's article.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.940]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.820]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.420]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.420]  at home.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:19.460]  I've tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.460]  the shots.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:25.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:30.900]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:35.580]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.980]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:42.100]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.940]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.940]  of the Republic.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:55.880]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:04.660]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century?
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:09.380]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours and your neighbors, thankful for the
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:14.100]  unemployment checks since you were laid off and placing your child's name on the angel
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.260]  tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:22.280]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:27.780]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.260]  dependency, your food supply.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.300]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.900]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.740]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognize
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]  risk.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.860]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:14.080]  The Cow Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.620]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:25.340]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.020]  or antibacterials.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:32.540]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.900]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.220]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.300]  to do something you've never done before.

[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:33.900]  Well, Obama has announced that he wants an internet ID.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:39.060]  Of course, Microsoft has already set up all their new computers for years with that.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:43.900]  And soon it won't be a thumbprint or even a special number, it will be a face scan.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.460]  And they're coming out with a new mouse driven systems on the new Windows system where you
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:51.020]  don't have a mouse, your eyes control it.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.940]  And the Microsoft Connect video game face scans you and voice prints you.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:03.100]  Face scanning to buy and sell, that has been the big global consortium plan all along.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.540]  You will scan your hand or your face.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.360]  And of course, the churches say that's not the mark of the beast.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.420]  They say it's gonna be a mark in the face or in the hand.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:19.620]  Well, what do you think your own biometric outline basically is?
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:24.420]  But even if God didn't exist, the point is the globalists are trying to play God by setting
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.420]  all of this up.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:32.920]  And we do have the article by Kurt Nemo that breaks down the fact that if a war does kick
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:38.620]  off with Iran, it could lead to a World War III type scenario.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.220]  War in the Middle East now appears imminent as the United States, Britain and the European
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:47.980]  Union and Israel put the finishing touches on an embargo of Iran, a de facto declaration
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:48.980]  of war.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.620]  That's one thing Iran may be forced into this.
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.340]  And warships steam towards the Persian Gulf.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:10:00.580]  Consider the following recent developments, US-Israel war game in Persian Gulf.
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:04.460]  On Friday, the US and Israel announced they plan a massive military exercise in the Persian
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.080]  Gulf in an attempt to confront Iran, in their own words.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.780]  The exercise dubbed Austere Challenge 12, and they're gonna make Iran austere, cutting
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:18.140]  off half their fuel, will include the participation of thousands of US and Israeli soldiers and
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:23.000]  will test multiple air defense systems against incoming missiles and rockets.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.700]  For when Iran's attacked, and it'll be on the media, how dare Iran fire back, only the
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.420]  worst fire back.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:35.500]  Now I've seen police in the US type it in, police chief says, fetal position assault
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.500]  on officer.
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:41.940]  They actually say, if you get in a fetal position, it's assault, and it's resistant.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:45.540]  So I mean, if they walk up and say, open your shirt, I'm shooting you with a shotgun.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:51.460]  If you don't say, thank you, God, open and say, kill me, and then say, I worship you
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.620]  five times, then you're evil.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:57.140]  I mean, of course, I'm being absurd here, but that's how ridiculous this has gotten.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:01.780]  A few months ago, they were kicking people and pepper spraying them, balled up protesters,
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:05.540]  and they said, yeah, well, that's what they deserve, that's a form of resistance.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.580]  Yes, you're supposed to say, here's my teeth, kick them out.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:14.020]  They're like, good, you get a medal, knock your teeth out.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:19.580]  Don't worry, the bankers are gonna knock your dollar out and knock you out with sodium fluoride.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.840]  Everybody gets to get hurt here in the New World Order.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:30.600]  On January 2nd, during the last military exercise, Iran tested the Qaadir missile, a long range
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.620]  sea to shore missile, and the surface to surface Noor missile.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:41.340]  The Noor is an advanced radar evading, target seeking guided and controlled missile, can
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.180]  easily find its target and destroy it.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:48.540]  Iran has announced a new war game.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:56.300]  And that's gonna coincide with British warships, US and Israel, including destroyers that are
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.620]  now all converging in the area.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:05.060]  French and Russian warships are off Syria, basically threatening each other.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.540]  Ron Paul points out that sanctions are the first step to war.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.700]  These are serious blockades and embargoes are about to set up.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:20.380]  Oil prices have already risen to $113.20 a barrel because of this.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.160]  Iran missile base propaganda.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.520]  Now that Iran's Ahmadinejad is visiting Latin America, it is credited rumor that Iran is
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:35.260]  building intermediate range missile launch pads at a base on the peninsula in Venezuela
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.260]  has resurfaced.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:41.300]  It was initially floated by the German newspaper Die Welt, and subsequently boosted by the
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.420]  Jerusalem Post, a documented neocon propaganda operation.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.180]  The Post posted the story as well.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:51.900]  The story brings to mind the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 62, but those were real
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.900]  missiles.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:57.220]  According to Die Welt's story, the Iranians paid tens of millions in cash for the base
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.160]  that would be used to fire missiles in the United States after Iran is attacked.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.660]  It was reported the Revolutionary Guard controlled engineering group, Khatam Al Anabi, is helping
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.740]  build the site.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:16.460]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:23.900]  Now look at this article here out of the Washington Post that I just mentioned.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.340]  Obama wants Internet ID.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:34.960]  FCC's head proposed broadband reform as well, and that the Internet ID people, to quote,
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.660]  make the biggest users pay.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.480]  They say you're making it cost more for those that don't use as much.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:46.900]  This is how they always shell new taxes, consumption taxes this way.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.300]  Globalist corporate taxes to companies, you name it.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.700]  It's been high tech driving this economy that would be in a complete cardiac arrest for
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:14:04.540]  the last 14 years or so, 13 years or so, since 99, if we didn't have this high tech economy.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.220]  And to let government put taxes on the Internet, which they're starting to push at state and
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.100]  federal level and international, and to let corporations start charging you more.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.600]  You already get charged more for the type of connection or data plan you get on a cell
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.020]  phone, on a computer, any of this, you're already paying for it.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.620]  But how did they start in the 20s?
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:29.880]  With driver's license, which were commercial license, they told the public the trucks are
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.280]  tearing up the roads you pay for.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.780]  They use the roads to make money.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:38.020]  They're in commerce, let's start taxing them.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.500]  The public said, yeah, get them.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.940]  And by the 50s, they made everybody get a driver's license and start paying.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.460]  Now they use it to totally track us.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:54.660]  In a Monday speech, Federal Communications Chairman outlined a draft proposal that would
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:59.980]  reform the commission's lifeline program to include provisions to encourage broadband
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:00.980]  adoption.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:05.080]  The program currently aimed at providing affordable telephone service to low income Americans
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.780]  is supported by the Universal Service Fund.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:13.140]  The program is outdated, focused on phone service when high speed Internet has become
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:17.220]  our vital communications platform, but buried in there, they have the other part.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:22.820]  In his remarks, the chairman said the program has been successful, but has also been plagued
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.100]  with problems of accountability and efficiency.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:29.260]  Multiple service providers are often supplying lifeline subsidies to the same households,
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.460]  he said, because there is no centralized system.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.860]  They want an ID to address the issue.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:39.740]  The draft proposal creates a national database of lifeline users to prevent duplicative billing,
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.100]  and you know that's gonna be used for Internet ID.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:47.680]  It also sets a budget for lifeline aimed to connecting eligible consumers with staying
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.100]  within budget, tracking you, and requires the participating companies to be subject
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.620]  to independent audits every two years.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.340]  You think the government's just gonna give you a free phone line for free?
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:03.420]  It's gonna be used to have the FCC take over the web.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:08.740]  The chairman said the FCC work would deal with existing broadband adoption programs
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.460]  in a pilot program.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.740]  So basically, they're gonna expand that, and of course, the FCC's also announced they're
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:19.140]  gonna regulate broadband, broadcast, Internet, wireless.
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:25.420]  And gonna have quote, just like Europe already does in many areas, filters on hateful material.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:32.260]  Hate, hacking, gambling, porn, and there's one other that they have in these databases.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:39.180]  And guess what, Infowars is listed in many databases, under hate and under hacking.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:43.500]  I've even seen this listed under gambling, there's no gambling going on.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.640]  So you go to a library, you go to a college, you go to a military base, you go to a train
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.220]  station that's got free broadband, which taxpayers are paying for.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:59.900]  That doesn't give you something free unless they want the control to set the precedent.
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:04.180]  So that's what's going on on that front.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.340]  Now I mentioned this earlier, you can go up to infowars.com and see it.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:14.500]  And I also played the CBS clip, and I wanna cue that back up if we can.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:20.020]  Later we're gonna have some clips in the third hour, more clips of Obama speeches saying,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.020]  I don't need Congress.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.980]  I wanna do things without Congress, I'll do whatever I can.
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:29.060]  Yeah, launch wars without Congress, shut down power plants without Congress, and outside
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:34.860]  of law make us adopt all these new green regulations that are about federal control, not about
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.860]  greening.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.660]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:46.180]  CBS reporter blatantly excludes Ron Paul from coverage, despite the fact that Paul is surging
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:50.860]  and Romney sliding, gap now only 15 points.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:54.980]  Despite the fact that Ron Paul is polling in second place in New Hampshire, and rapidly
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.580]  closing the gap on Mitt Romney, according to the latest polls, one CBS reporter did
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.500]  her best to convince viewers that Paul does not even exist.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:09.020]  It's a familiar picture for Paul supporters who have had to watch over and over as mainstream
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.020]  media.
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:15.620]  And again, I've gotta get all my writers and myself to stop calling them mainstream media.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:23.500]  Mainstream whores, prostitutes, corporate paid deceivers, zombie control systems, certified
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:29.100]  twisters and deceivers, dissemblers, I mean, I don't know, den of viper media, dinosaur
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:35.860]  devil media, dinosaur tyrant media, terrible lizard media, I don't know.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:41.320]  It's a familiar picture for Paul supporters who have had to watch over and over again
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.860]  as mainstream media, that is deceivers, talking heads and pundits have consistently either
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:54.000]  laughed off the Texas congressman's chances for GOP nominee or simply excluded Paul from
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.180]  their coverage altogether.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.380]  And again, we're gonna play that clip in a moment, we played earlier.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:04.080]  However, within the past few weeks, the networks were forced to begin taking Paul seriously
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.380]  as he began consistently polling in first or second ahead of the Iowa caucuses, eventually
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.020]  finishing third in what was easily a three-way tie.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.820]  Yeah, that was clear fraud there, that's not been confirmed, but it was accidental.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.100]  They had to have a gentleman's agreement and precinct after precinct and say that Paul
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:25.540]  got less and Santorum got more.
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.060]  We come back, we'll play that clip.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:31.120]  Going into New Hampshire and ahead of two debates this weekend, Paul was polling in
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.380]  strong second as he has been for some time.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:40.540]  However, that did not stop CBS political correspondent, Jan Crawford from showing graphics and talking
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:46.020]  about recent polling without even mentioning Paul's numbers or even that he was involved
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.020]  in the race at all.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:54.340]  Yeah, they have Romney 43, Gingrich 9, Huntsman 7, Santorum 6, and of course you've got Ron
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:20:00.380]  Paul putting on the poll 10 to 13 points, some polls only eight points behind Romney,
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.380]  but no one will tell you that.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.300]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.300]  filtration.

[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.260]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors want to talk about gold
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.260]  IRAs?
[01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:40.260]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.940]  of gold for your retirement.

[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:51.140]  Warning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance known to the state of California
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.060]  to cause birth defects or cancer.
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:56.580]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.300]  You must be 18 years or older to purchase.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:08.020]  You know, I keep going back to this theme over and over again, but you've seen every
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.020]  major TV network.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:15.540]  When Ron Paul comes in second or first place or third, they just don't even show him in
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.600]  the running.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:22.380]  And Jon Stewart a few months ago famously put all that together in a compendium just
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:25.220]  to show the arrogance.
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:33.260]  And how left, right, center, the entire establishment demonizes Ron Paul and demonizes anybody else
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:38.500]  that doesn't want foreign banks robbing us blind and setting up paramilitary police on
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.460]  street corners fondling our genitals.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.260]  TSA now fondling people all over the country on the streets.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:49.820]  And I get calls all the time and look it up and it's in the local news where there they
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:50.820]  are.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.700]  And I'm gonna get back into that in a moment.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:59.860]  New Jersey will pay you $1,000 to rat out your neighbors for guns.
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:07.420]  It's here folks, as the economy implodes, more and more of this nation is gonna live
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.300]  off of ratting out their neighbors.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:14.580]  But here's again that CBS piece, we have an article on infowars.com about it.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:19.780]  CBS reporter blatantly excludes Ron Paul from coverage, doesn't show that he was in second
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.780]  place.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:21.780]  Here's the clip.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:27.180]  Who polls in single digits here is looking to give Romney a run in the Granite State
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.000]  after his near victory in Iowa.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.360]  As for the losers in our Texas governor, there was the graphic on CBS News and you watch
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.800]  the whole news piece.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.700]  No mention of Ron Paul, it's like he's from the planet Mars.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:46.220]  He's rising in the polls, Romney's dropping and they're desperately ignoring him because
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.860]  they know he could win.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.540]  My gosh, it's just off the charts insane.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:56.740]  Now we're gonna cover this more on the nightly news this evening, but this is a big deal.
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.420]  It's up at infowars.com.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:06.020]  New Jersey will pay you $1,000 to destroy the Second Amendment.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:12.580]  This is totally disgusting.
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:15.400]  It's the citizen informant.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:19.620]  Without citizen informants, tyrants could never retain the kind of power they wield.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:24.620]  In fact, without citizen informants, totalitarian movements would never gain traction, but there's
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.540]  always little minions who want some uniform and want to oppress people, and always little
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:34.280]  minions that want to toady after them, which they always gnash their teeth later.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.960]  This is why every functional oligarchy throughout history has implemented programs designed
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:47.060]  to encourage the development of common spies using the promise of monetary reward and collective
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.060]  recognition.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:52.260]  Sadly, there are many in our society that would gladly sell out their closest friends
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:57.460]  and family to the tortures of authoritarian bureaucracy for nothing more than a firm pat
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.940]  on the head and a few fiat dollars.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:06.380]  If there was ever more deranged, a lot of bottom-feeding opportunist scum, the citizen
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:10.180]  informant is the very essence of it.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.420]  With the implementation of the See Something, Say Something program and the increasing drive
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:19.520]  by the White House to institute community watch efforts to route out extremists.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.300]  That's the government's main, not crime, not even foreign, foreign terrorists, domestic
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.300]  groups.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:28.220]  I told you that years ago, but now it's public.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:34.980]  These quite clearly in strategic outlines, like the empowering local partners to prevent
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.240]  violent extremism in the United States.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:44.180]  But now in New Jersey and other areas, they're offering $1,000 for every person you turn
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:46.980]  in who owns guns.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:53.300]  And alt-market.com originally wrote this article, excellent piece, breaking it down.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.380]  And we have a clip of the video.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.220]  This is going on all over the country, but here's New Jersey.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:59.220]  Play that clip.
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:00.220]  It's a TV ad.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.220]  No more guns.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.220]  877 NWK Guns.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:14.140]  Hi, I'm Mayor Cory Booker and I, like so many in our city, are just saying enough.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.700]  We have had a significant reduction in shootings in our city, but it is still too many.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:23.060]  There are a small group of people in our city that think they can walk around with guns.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.620]  It is unacceptable.
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.500]  But we can't just wish this will stop.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.760]  We can't just hope this will stop.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.780]  We as individuals have to do something about it.
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.300]  So we have a program in our city right now that's completely anonymous.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:44.340]  And we will give you cash, $1,000 to anyone who calls our anonymous tip line.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.620]  Give us the information about who is carrying a gun.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:51.160]  If we don't even have to have a conviction, we arrest that individual and simply get that
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.780]  gun off the streets.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:58.940]  You call back, get your second group of digits, go to a bank or send somebody to a bank, and
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:01.960]  they will give you $1,000 in cash.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.960]  No question asked.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.340]  Now again, he made the news a year ago announcing that.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:11.980]  Now they've got the TV ads on television, waving money around.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:16.860]  What about people carrying guns to protect themselves who own businesses, who don't want
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:18.980]  to get knocked on the head?
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.540]  I carry a gun.
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:24.780]  But see, I don't live in your town, pal.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:25.780]  But you know what?
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.720]  I've had people move here, like the carpet cleaner, 12, 13 years ago, saw a shotgun
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:35.100]  where I had children on the rack in my studio at my home.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.620]  And the guy flipped out and ran off and called the cops on me.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.620]  Well, tried to.
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:40.620]  And then I called and said, did they call the cops on me?
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:41.740]  I called the cleaner place.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.340]  They said, sir, we stopped him.
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:45.900]  We understand you're allowed to have that.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.380]  But you probably shouldn't have it out in plain view.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.180]  Get out of Texas, just get out.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:54.700]  Here on the march, the empire's on the get out of my state and move to communist China
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:55.700]  or Russia.
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.940]  Just get out of here, gelding.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.180]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:06.140]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.780]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:11.820]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:12.820]  or gold?
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:16.180]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.360]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:22.540]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:23.540]  seeds.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:28.580]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.700]  dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.700]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:36.020]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.500]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.780]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:48.580]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.580]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:57.560]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.540]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:05.780]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lung generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:10.380]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:14.220]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.900]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:21.660]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the silver lung generator.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:26.260]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:30.900]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:34.420]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:40.620]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.300]  digestive system.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:49.540]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:52.680]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:56.740]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.540]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:04.620]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the 21st century?
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:09.980]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors, thankful for the unemployment
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:15.280]  check since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.300]  of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:22.260]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:27.740]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:34.220]  dependency, your food supply, make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:39.620]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.820]  Take back control in 2012.
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:56.620]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:00.140]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:16.060]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:31.060]  Okay, we are now here at the midway point in this worldwide broadcast.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:37.500]  I'm gonna have completely open phones and news in the third hour today.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.980]  The toll free number to join us, if you wanna go ahead and get lined up, I'd love to hear
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:48.620]  from you on any of the issues we've mentioned, any of the topics we've raised, or any questions
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:54.220]  or comments you've got out of left field, right field, whatever the case is, I'd love
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:57.860]  to hear from you, 800-259-9231.
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:03.300]  I wanna continue with our focus on this Iran situation, because it's definitely escalating.
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:08.080]  And you heard Colonel Shaffer last hour that it's never been closer to war than it is now,
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.420]  but that he thinks it'll be an October surprise.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:16.460]  And that more of this is saber rattling, but once it kicks off, it could lead to a wider
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:19.940]  regional war with the Chinese involved and World War III.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:26.380]  That's why we've got the article up at Infowars.com right now, alert Iran crisis headed for World
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:27.380]  War III.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.140]  Doesn't mean we can't turn it around.
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:33.120]  It's like if I got in the car today as we're driving to Dallas, I could turn around before
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.060]  I got there, but it's headed that direction.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:40.900]  It's like telling some young teenager who's robbing houses and using hard drugs, you're
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:49.100]  headed to the penitentiary or dead, you can still turn it around.
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:54.500]  But before we go to our next guest on this subject, Wayne Madsen, before I introduce
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.660]  our guest, I wanna remind you that we have the book The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:34:59.660]  back in print.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:04.300]  It's been out of print for over a year, and that original book is out of print forever.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:09.100]  This is a updated and abridged book.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:10.820]  It's not the size of the Dallas phone book.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:18.460]  It's more the size of the Waco phone book or the Lakeway phone book to use some Texas
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.460]  parlance.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:22.860]  So it is available at Infowars.com.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:28.080]  All educators need this to understand why you're not allowed to teach, why our children
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.120]  are taught to regurgitate.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.620]  They're trained, they're not educated to be true free thinkers.
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:39.700]  Excellent book available at Infowars.com by the consummate insider from a Skull and Bones
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:47.500]  family and the former head of policy department of education available at Infowars.com.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:52.980]  We also have the Alex Jones Everything Special, all 18 of my DVDs, and we're gonna stop offering
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:53.980]  this at the end of the month.
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:56.900]  It was so popular, we're extending it because it's such a great tool.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:04.100]  Normally $360 for all 18 of my films, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Terror, Storm, Obama
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:09.940]  Deception, Martial Law, all of them, and a Free Citizen rule book at Infowars.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:16.080]  And in the Fed bumper stickers, 99.95, and the profit we do make funds my producers and
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:23.500]  writers and researchers and graphics people and type of specialists, I'm joking.
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:28.540]  But again, I'm just joking around, I'm always doing typos myself, so we're trying to work
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:29.540]  on never having those.
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:35.340]  But I see a lot of typos on even so-called mainstream media because I think word processors
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.860]  are just rife with it.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:43.620]  The point is you fund our truly alternative media operation when you buy the books, the
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:48.100]  videos, the DVDs, the T-shirts, and you get tools more importantly that are key in waking
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:49.100]  people up.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.900]  We couldn't have built this without your support.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:56.180]  So I wanna thank all of you for being supporters of prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:59.180]  We have 15-day free trial running right now as well.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.180]  We're doing the nightly news.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:06.340]  It's really finding its legs and growing, and it will soon exit the beta testing format.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:11.100]  So again, we wanna thank all of you that are prisonplanet.tv subscribers as well.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:18.820]  And lastly, I have now lost 27 pounds, and we're gonna do some before and after.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:22.460]  I should have done the before photos, but we got plenty of video of me.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:34.180]  27 pounds in, it's not even six weeks, it'll be six weeks Thursday, 27 pounds.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.020]  And I've done it with exercise, cutting back a little bit on what I was eating.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:43.300]  But mainly, when I'm really starving, I just have a tangy tangerine, or I have some of
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:50.220]  the Young Jevity whey powder mixed with real raw milk, and I mean, it's incredible.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:54.980]  My breakfast is at 5 AM, I got up today at actually 4 AM, I couldn't sleep.
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:57.980]  It was a tangy tangerine and then a cup of coffee.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:04.460]  And then all I've had so far then for my breakfast at about 1030 was a glass of whole milk, raw
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.940]  milk with some whey powder.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:15.300]  And then I'm gonna have another tangy tangerine, a mineral vitamin drink, and then eat a lunch
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.660]  that's pretty much my dinner.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:21.220]  Then I'll have another tangy tangerine tonight, and it's because my body needed the minerals
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:23.060]  and the vitamins and kept wanting food.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:28.140]  I mean, this stuff really works, folks, and it's not even sold as a weight loss deal.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:33.620]  That's what Ben Fuchs, the pharmacist, told me to use it for, and it's really working.
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:40.660]  I mean, I'm starving, bam, tangy tangerine, or bam, pollen burst, bam, rebound.

[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:18.300]  I'm going down to about 190 or so.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:23.900]  I'm going down, like the Led Zeppelin song, going down, going down now, going down to
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.900]  Chicago.
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.900]  We ought to go out with that, John Harmon, I know you've got it in the computer.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900]  All right, that's enough.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:33.700]  Let's go to Wayne Madsen until five after next hour, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:38.140]  He, of course, worked with the National Security Agency.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:43.500]  He also worked with major corporations on computer systems.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.820]  I can't go over his entire bio here.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.720]  He was in submarine, anti-submarine warfare in the Navy before that, and he's written
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.580]  for some of the biggest publications in the country, like the Atlanta Journal Constitution,
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.620]  Philadelphia Inquirer, Houston Chronicle, Miami Herald.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:03.860]  WayneMadsenReport.com is where you can find all of his great work.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:09.400]  And he joins us to give us his take on Iran, this spectrum, this cornucopia of things that
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:10.400]  are happening.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.340]  Sir, break that down for us.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:16.980]  And then give us your take on other things that are happening geopolitically right now,
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:17.980]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:18.980]  Okay, Alex.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:25.180]  Well, I actually happened to have spoken to a old friend of mine the other evening who
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:33.020]  was a very big advisor on U.S. policy in Iran, an individual who speaks fluent Farsi, the
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:38.780]  language of Iran, as well as Urdu, the major language of Pakistan, and Dari, which is spoken
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.980]  in Afghanistan.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:48.060]  And his take on things was he is very much afraid that the U.S. will participate in some
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.700]  sort of military action before the election.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:57.540]  Now, my feeling on this is, talking to some other people, is what will that entail?
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:05.340]  Will that be overt military action, or will it be covert U.S. support for an Anglo-Israeli
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:12.500]  and possibly French attack on Iran that avoids the issue of the body bags and coffins coming
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:19.540]  back to Dover Air Force Base during the election year, but also basically disarms those Republican
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:25.700]  critics of Obama who say he's not doing enough against Iran, so he can basically have
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:28.820]  his cake and eat it, too.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:35.300]  There are some real problems with this, however, and I add to French in there, that's a caveat.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:42.300]  Nicolas Sarkozy is also running for reelection, but in his case, he may see French support
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:44.980]  for military attack as something that can benefit him.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:51.540]  He's very far down in the polls, and he may try to play that nationalistic card in
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:57.260]  France against, especially against Marine Le Ten, who's running for president from
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.260]  his right.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:03.540]  So, the British, though, you can pretty much count them in, the Israelis count them in.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:08.140]  The U.S. may play a role, but it will be one where Obama can say, we support the action,
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.900]  but look, no U.S. military troops are involved.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:16.500]  You know, the other day, Obama announced a new strategy for the U.S. militarily.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:23.460]  He's shifting focus from the Middle East to East Asia, and he met with the Chairman's
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:27.940]  Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of Staff of the Army.
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:32.240]  This is a Pentagon plan, he's on board with it.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.980]  And that's just a public announcement of what China already knows, so-called U.S. bases.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:41.220]  Our country's been taken over, being built now, even in Australia.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:44.740]  That's why the President of China, as you know, a month ago said, prepare for war with
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:45.740]  the United States.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:48.140]  I mean, that was in major headlines.
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:49.140]  This is getting crazy.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:56.060]  Well, and here's the problem, China and two of our allies in East Asia, South Korea and
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:02.080]  Japan have already announced they're not going to abide by these sanctions against Iranian
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.700]  oil shipments, which are going to be kicking in soon.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.860]  They've announced they're not going to participate.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:14.660]  They both, all three countries, China, Japan and South Korea rely heavily on Iranian oil
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.660]  exports.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:21.580]  And what they get in, what Iran gets in return for that is refined gasoline, because the
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:26.780]  Iranian refining capacity has really been hurt by U.S. sanctions.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:33.540]  Of course, we know that Dick Cheney's company, Halliburton, tried to get in there and improve
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.540]  on those capabilities.
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:39.460]  Yeah, no, they had it under Bush set up where only they were allowed to sell them the equipment.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:44.220]  So just shows that they're always lecturing us about be for war, you're with the Iranians.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.060]  Meanwhile, they're in business with them.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:52.340]  But specifically, Wayne, looking at this right now, what do you make of the Israeli, U.S.,
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.260]  British fleets steaming back into the Strait of Hormuz?
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:59.420]  What do you make of the Iranians a week ago saying, you better not come back through there.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.660]  This is your final warning.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:05.660]  What do you make of Iran talking about asymmetrical warfare in Tel Aviv and New York?
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:08.140]  Why are they saber rattling so much more now?
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:16.380]  Well, they're having to placate the war hawks in Washington, London, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.380]  and Paris.
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:24.080]  And also, people like Ahmadinejad has to placate his war hawks in Iran.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.780]  But I think there was a little bit of a monkey wrench thrown into these plans when the U.S.
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:35.740]  Navy rescued about a half dozen or so, or about a dozen Iranian fishermen who had been
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:37.540]  captured by Somali pirates.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:43.500]  Now, the U.S. Navy and the Iranian Navy and also the Iranian Revolutionary Guard do maintain
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:48.780]  protocols to avoid incidents in the Gulf, and these have been very successful.
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:54.940]  So there are communications constantly between the U.S. Navy and the Gulf and the Iranian
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.900]  Navy and military.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:03.900]  And I think the fact that the U.S. Navy rescued these dozen Iranian fishermen really was probably
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.260]  not very popular among some of the war hawk neo-cons here in Washington.
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:15.300]  They probably would have rather had the Somali pirates eat those Iranian fishermen.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:21.980]  But I think that there's wiser heads prevailing right now, especially in the U.S. Navy, the
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:27.860]  U.S. fleet of Bahrain, and they have to deal with the Iranians on a daily basis, and obviously
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:33.420]  they don't want to see any kind of war because they know, you know, our fleet is pretty vulnerable
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:37.060]  to Iranian missile attacks over there.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:42.580]  As you mentioned, asymmetric warfare, Iran has a lot of influence in Iraq.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:44.860]  And look, not all the U.S. troops have left Iraq.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:49.460]  There's still, at certain bases there, we still have the private security contractors
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.460]  there.
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:54.860]  We still have a whole load of State Department personnel there, and these people would all
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:46:01.260]  be sitting ducks if the Iranians decided to activate their allies in Iraq.
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:08.700]  So the Pentagon probably more than anyone else knows what's at stake if these war hawks
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:09.700]  get their way.
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:14.780]  Now, Wayne, I want to put out a nuanced statement here, because our detractors will always do
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:15.780]  what they do.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:21.660]  They'll always build straw men that don't really represent who we are or what we are,
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:27.380]  and then go out and have a sword battle with the straw man and claim that they've defeated
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:28.380]  it.
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:35.300]  But if you go back in October to November, it was all over the Israeli news, all over
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:39.860]  the European news, that a strike was imminent, that the Washington Times reported that Netanyahu
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.860]  wanted it.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:44.100]  He believes politically that'll make him popular.
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:48.980]  And then right on time, all of my military sources said, yeah, it's on, we're being told,
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:49.980]  get ready.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.900]  Move the troops to Kuwait, out of Iraq, get ready to back up the attack, getting troops
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:58.220]  covertly into Israel, now admitted months later.
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:01.740]  And the point is, they were moving and green lighting.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:08.500]  So we said, get on air, call Congress, tell them don't do this, get pressure on the military.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:11.940]  Listen to the former admirals, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mullen, who said it was
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:16.220]  a disaster, the former head of Mossad, who Netanyahu fired because he wouldn't go along
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.220]  with this.
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:21.940]  This is not a good idea, even the top globalist are having a fight on this.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:27.980]  And then they spin it and say, we're always hearing about war with Iran, it's never going
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:29.420]  to happen.
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:33.180]  And then now it's in the news that they're moving towards a strike, Israel says they
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.180]  may strike.
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:38.140]  But the establishment puts out their operatives to say, that's ridiculous, there's not gonna
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:41.420]  be a war, so that we can't build opposition.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:43.380]  Same thing with the NDAA.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:46.740]  The first month, they have a debate saying it doesn't affect citizens.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.340]  Then later they say, you bet it does, after they'd already passed it, then Obama signed
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:52.340]  it.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:55.840]  He said he wouldn't sign it to kill opposition, cuz well, he's not gonna sign it anyways.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:58.940]  These are tactics, you've learned them, I've learned them.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:02.780]  You've been on Capitol Hill for decades, I see you on C-SPAN there, writing notes during
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:03.780]  these hearings.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:09.720]  But the public gets fooled by these tricks, so they keep pushing for war while separately
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:14.540]  saying it's asinine that they're going to have a war as a psychological tactic, so that
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.840]  we can't build an opposition to it.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:21.500]  Then if we're successful and back off war for the third or fourth time, as we know five
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:25.560]  years ago, Cheney was about to do it, attack our own ships.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.880]  New Yorker magazine, Cy Hirsch, it's the same thing.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.280]  Then when we're successful backing them off, see, there was never a threat.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.520]  Do you agree with how I'm breaking down their psychological operation or psy-op?
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.320]  And do you concur with what I'm saying?
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:47.800]  Well, of course, and we have the master of this cognitive dissonance, Kat Sunstein, is
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.600]  basically the propaganda czar for the Obama White House.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:57.520]  So I mean, you look at all his friends and colleagues and even his wife Samantha Powers,
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:05.720]  she's the person who dreamed up all these Arab Spring revolts and these things, George
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.280]  Soros-type color revolutions all around the world.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.280]  And some of them, obviously, the one in Iran, failed.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:19.320]  The one in Tunisia and Egypt were successful, although they're probably ruining the fact
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.360]  that they even supported the one in Egypt.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:31.800]  But I think you're correct, yeah, this is a propaganda, most of this is a propaganda
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.800]  war where they're just trying to get into people's heads, make them think something
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.920]  when in fact they're doing something entirely different.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.640]  From your decades of research, and I respect your analysis, your view on this, what do
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.720]  you think is going to end up happening with Iran?
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:55.720]  Or what are the two or three different probable scenarios that we're going down?
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:03.640]  Well, we already know that the New York Times, once again, as is its want, has put out this
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:10.000]  false information about Iran trying to develop a nuclear weapon, this is the same nonsense
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.560]  that Judy Miller was putting out when she worked for the New York Times, we're seeing
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:21.080]  it play out again, there's been really no change in that program, and still, the CIA
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:30.600]  came out in 03 with a new finding that Iran did add some nuclear weapons in pensions,
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:37.120]  but it is basically a peaceful nuclear power program now, but they're still pushing this
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.280]  meme that Iran wants a nuclear weapon, and as long as they do that, they're going to
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.600]  have support from some of these little Republicans.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:48.280]  All right, stay there, I want to hear where you think all this is going, and the war rhetoric

[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:06.720]  In the event of an emergency, do you really trust Obama and the federal government to

[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:08.700]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:11.440]  a war on for your mind.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:17.200]  Okay, we've got Wayne with us till five after, then it's gonna be your phone calls and a
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:20.640]  bunch of news for the rest of the third hour.
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:24.620]  But going back to Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, former officer at the National
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:31.320]  Security Agency in very secretive areas, joins us with his perspective on Iran.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:36.240]  Colonel Shaffer was on during the last hour, and he said, yes, and he hasn't talked like
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:37.240]  this before.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:43.120]  He said, yes, it's moving in the direction towards an attack on Iran as an October surprise.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:48.620]  But that's not foregone conclusion, cooler heads may prevail in the military.
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:51.720]  And I'm getting that that's basically what you're implying.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:57.600]  But you really can't divorce what's going on with Iran and the favor rattling from the
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  presidential campaign.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:06.360]  There's only two Republican candidates who are dead set against going to war with Iran,
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:09.840]  and that's Ron Paul, and somebody we hardly ever hear about.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.040]  He gets less attention than Paul, that's Buddy Roemer from Louisiana.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.700]  But all the rest of them are trying to outdo one another on who's going to nuke to Iran
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.160]  first, especially Rick Santorum.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:29.560]  And I have a story up today, well, two stories up about Santorum, why he has surged ahead.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:34.600]  He is, I mean, the man was on the board of directors for the Israel Project, which is
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:44.000]  a totally pro-Lacoud think tank here in Washington with deep pockets, and his two advisors, his
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.600]  two chief foreign policy advisors are none other than Michael Ledeen and Richard Perle.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.080]  If you remember who those individuals were, they were the chief architects and cheerleaders
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:56:00.640]  for the U.S. intervention in Iraq, and they're certainly at the forefront of those who are
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:08.240]  calling for the overthrow of the quote, unquote, mullahs in Iran.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:12.320]  So continuing along those lines, are we closer to war?
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:19.200]  Well, I think what we're going to see here is it's all going to be based on the presidential
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.200]  campaign.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:25.800]  Now Romney, of course, has also called for U.S. troops to not only go back into Iraq
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:28.760]  but get into it with the Iranians.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:34.760]  But we know that Mitt Romney is a virtual, I mean, this guy will bend with the wind,
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:39.840]  he sticks his finger up in the air and sees which way the wind is blowing.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:47.080]  But I don't see Romney, if Romney's the nominee, I think that this war talk will diminish.
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:52.880]  But if it's somebody like Santorum or Newt Gingrich who's also in bed with these war
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:57:00.500]  hawks, then I think we're going to probably see Obama try to get from under the issue
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:07.640]  by at least covertly supporting an Anglo-Israeli and maybe French attack on the Iranians.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:14.880]  You mentioned that the U.S. troops now are stationed in Israel, you know, and they're
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:18.280]  especially for anti-missile defense there.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:25.480]  So I think we've got the baseline for either over-U.S. military action or covert action
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:31.760]  using the Israeli, British, and French as sort of the cover for us.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:39.760]  But I think all this depends on the presidential election because Iran, because of this constant
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:45.480]  drumbeat for war by most of these Republican candidates, Obama's going to have to respond
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.480]  somehow to that.
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.040]  Well, you're right, we're going to come back in a moment for five more minutes and I want
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:55.240]  to get your take on Jesse Ventura.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.680]  The reason I've covered this quite a bit is that it's now been confirmed to be a complete
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:01.720]  lie.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:09.080]  And they hired Ventura at MSNBC and then fired him, but kept him under contract and threatened
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:12.320]  to sue him if he talked bad about the war.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.520]  He was under contract for three years.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.620]  Now they're just trying to assassinate his character, claiming he's reckless driving
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:20.720]  in California when he's in Minnesota.
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:21.720]  That was a fraud.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:26.640]  Now claiming he says he loves it when troops die at a wake in front of people.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.800]  I mean, this comes right out of central casting.
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:32.640]  He's totally denied it and is, of course, going to sue everybody involved.
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.580]  And he is, he's not litigious, but he will sue people, he's well known for it.
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:39.360]  And Fox News and others just don't care.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:44.960]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:11.960]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:59:53.920 --> 02:00:05.560]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.440]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:11.440]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:17.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:26.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:32.480]  Something like Jesse Ventura being attacked always by Rupert Murdoch outfits the last
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:36.040]  month with patently fake stories.
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:39.700]  And then when he threatens to sue them, they just remove it, they don't retract.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:44.760]  I have been at the receiving end of this because you see, as a constitutionalist, as a Ron
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:50.440]  Paul-type libertarian patriot, I'm what Fox News hates.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.940]  Because they're the fake version, to a certain extent, of what I am, or what Ron Paul is.
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:01:01.760]  So they need to hold that into the spectrum to control the right wing, if you use that
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.600]  outdated stupid term.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.600]  I'm into freedom, not about left and right, but they see us as right wing, so they hate
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:09.600]  us.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:12.040]  They wanna basically say, that restaurant across the street, don't eat there.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:17.520]  They've got cockroaches the size of your Chihuahua, and it's not true.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:22.100]  Fox News has the cockroaches, my operation doesn't.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.320]  My business is liberty and freedom, their business is globalization and tyranny.
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:28.420]  Same thing with the leftist control arms.
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:32.200]  They're there to be gatekeepers on the left, Ford Foundation, the rest of it.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.040]  Wayne, in closing, I saw this as key with Ventura.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:39.440]  Right as he goes into Mexico, right as they know he doesn't have cell phones till he gets
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:43.140]  to his place in Baja, and then that's Skype.
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:48.680]  They come out and say, yeah, he was at a bar telling a family he's glad their son died,
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:50.400]  so I knocked him out.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.680]  And right as the guy has a book come out, then I looked him up.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.280]  And what's creepy is, he's tied in with what you just said, Richard Perle, and he's setting
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:03.480]  up a domestic group to deal with domestic extremists and train police in Dallas nationwide.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:08.720]  I mean, I guess they said, okay, here's your first order, we're gonna make you a big hero,
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:09.720]  but destroy Jesse Ventura.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.760]  Right, and I think this has to do a lot with Jesse Ventura's support for Ron Paul.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:19.920]  Let's not forget, Perle is also one of the chief advisors to Rick Santorum.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.480]  Now, let's turn the tables on Mr. Santorum.
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:30.240]  I'm reporting, basically updating an old story today, Rick Santorum started the Penn State
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:35.880]  College Republicans in 1977 as a freshman, which is kind of odd as a freshman, with the
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:40.440]  help of a guy named Phil English, former Congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:47.640]  Now, English was arrested in Erie in the 1980s for soliciting sex from an underage African-American
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:48.640]  male.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:50.840]  This was very much covered up.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:57.240]  English was the head of the Pennsylvania College Republicans, helped Santorum start the Penn
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:04.080]  State College Republicans, and 1977 was the same year that Jerry Sandusky began the Second
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.080]  Mile Foundation.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:06.080]  Now, what-
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.040]  Oh my gosh, are you saying he could be involved in that ring?
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:16.440]  I'm saying there's a lot of, there's more than smoke there, there's fire there.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:23.080]  And let me just say that I'm on this story, and remember, there was a sportscaster out
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:29.400]  of Pittsburgh who said, look, the Second Mile Foundation was used to pimp young boys out
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.920]  to the well-heeled donors to that foundation.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:35.160]  Well, no, that's the guy that really broke the story that didn't care if they threatened
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.160]  him.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:37.160]  That's the guy that broke it.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:38.160]  That's right.
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.160]  That's right.
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:42.960]  There's other sources I have in Pennsylvania who corroborated that, and here's the issue
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.040]  with Santorum and Sandusky.
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:54.200]  We know that Santorum awarded Sandusky some sort of an angel award back in 2002, an adoption
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.200]  angel.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.200]  He was an adoption angel.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:00.880]  But Santorum was one of three senators who could, they could hire more staff than members
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:03.040]  of the House because they have a bigger budget.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:08.400]  Santorum was one of the three senators that was known to hire a lot of staffers, young
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.640]  male staffers, out of diversion programs.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.480]  And remember, Second Mile Foundation was, you know, one of the things they did was divert
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:21.600]  people from jail and get them, you know, set on a better way, so to speak.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:27.760]  They also used pages, congressional pages, Senate pages, to basically hold them in these
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.120]  three Senate offices until some of the perverts over on the House side make their selection,
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.200]  you know, March Foley- Also, you're saying that he might have been
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200]  a stabler.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.200]  Hold on.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.920]  Can you do five more minutes to start at the beginning of this and go right through it?
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:46.200]  Holy mackerel.
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:52.000]  Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen's our guest, and I tell you, look, the establishment
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.360]  wouldn't be pushing this gentleman unless they had dirt on him to destroy him.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.360]  We better know that.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:04:59.360]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:05.120]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.360]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.040]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:12.680]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:17.240]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:18.480]  on Earth.
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:23.280]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.120]  expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:29.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.240]  powerful shadow state.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:35.240]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:41.400]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:45.500]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.040]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:52.040]  It's here.

[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:10.080]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors thankful for the unemployment

[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:18.480]  of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:22.360]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:27.880]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control, your greatest
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:30.320]  dependency, your food supply.

[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:06.900]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.280]  a war on for your mind.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:25.000]  Everett, Robert, Judy, Eric, Gazelle, we're going to get to all of you coming up here
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.760]  in about five minutes, but I was bringing up, why are they going after Jesse Ventura?
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:33.160]  And obviously, he can do a third party run.
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:39.520]  They don't want that screwing up how they've selected this election with their ringer,
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:43.320]  the bot and paid for Mitt Romney and their other ringer, the bot and paid for either
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:44.600]  way they want to do it.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:49.080]  Barack Obama, they could play the two puppets off against each other.
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.680]  And so they're trying to destroy Ventura with incredible defamation right now.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:58.080]  They wouldn't be doing this unless they were concerned and then he brought up Rick Santorum
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:02.520]  and connections to the whole Penn State Sandusky situation.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:06.000]  So start from the beginning, run through it.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.760]  For folks that forget what goes on in Congress, you've covered it for years.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.360]  I don't know, a lot of estimations are what, 60% of the Republican leadership?
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:18.160]  You don't even get recruited in unless you're part of the pedophile network.
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:25.840]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove are all homoerotic, 110%.
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:29.700]  Richard Nixon said that to major publications.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:32.640]  Just type in Richard Nixon on Bohemian Grove, you'll get Harper's and others.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:37.720]  You can actually hear the audio, I can't play it here because of the profanity.
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:41.060]  So we have to give credibility what you're saying, but you're investigating this now.
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:44.080]  You said earlier, there's not just smoke, there's fire.
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.200]  Now, I want you to get into that, but this is obviously something dangerous.
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:52.240]  First, people have asked, you did kind of disappear for about six months and you were
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.240]  overseas.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:55.840]  You said you were leaving the country because you've been told by a good source they might
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.200]  try to whack you.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.360]  Why have you come back to the US, Wayne?
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:04.200]  Then let's get into the Rick Santorum Sandusky connection.
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:05.200]  Right.
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.160]  Well, the grass always looks greener on the other side of the pond until you go over there
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:11.760]  and you find out things are pretty expensive.
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:18.520]  And unless you have a good support network, it's hard to just relocate up and move.
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:23.480]  So we're in election year, this story now I think is very important.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:29.840]  The National College Republicans have always been sort of a nexus for a lot of young male
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:30.840]  gays.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:39.120]  In 1973, Perry Dolan, who was later found out to be openly gay, ran for chairman of
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.240]  the National College Republicans.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:47.960]  He died in 86, but in 73, he was beaten for that job by none other than Karl Rove.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:54.920]  Now, in 1977, Phil English, who goes from the University of Pennsylvania over to Penn
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:00.400]  State to help a freshman named Rick Santorum start the Penn State chapter of the College
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:06.560]  Republicans there, that's the same year that Jerry Sandusky starts the Second Miles
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:07.560]  Foundation.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:13.640]  Both Sandusky and Joe Paterno, big supporters of the College of Penn State Republicans as
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.880]  well as Republicans statewide in Pennsylvania.
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:22.720]  In the 1980s, Phil English is Santorum's friend, who by the way is supporting Romney,
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.440]  but he's still saying that he thinks Santorum is a very good candidate, hedging his bets
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:29.440]  no doubt.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:35.680]  Phil English, when he was city controller of Erie, was arrested for a propositioning
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:38.720]  an underage African American male.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:42.280]  It was covered up because he was a city official.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:46.260]  Later there were two other incidents, one in Erie, one in Harrisburg, the one in Erie
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:56.040]  was covered up by the mayor then, Lou Tulio, and we have then Santorum going into the Senate
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:02.080]  being one of three senators who would get people from the page system, from the diversion
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:07.240]  programs, from the College Republicans, to bring them in as staffers and then keep them
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:14.920]  there until they could be formed out to House members who, you know, basically would elect
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:17.040]  who they'd want to work on their own staff.
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:22.640]  Those three senators were Rick Santorum, Jim Fallon from Missouri, and George Allen from
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:23.640]  Virginia.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:28.440]  George Allen, I have to say, is running for his old seat this year from the old Dominion,
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:35.480]  so these were the three individuals who I was told back in 2006 were part of this whole
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:41.780]  network of recruitment, and this was at the height of, if you recall, the House page scandal
[02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:46.160]  involving a number of members of Congress, including, of course, Mark Foley from Florida
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:49.420]  who resigned because of that scandal.
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:59.360]  So we have, and then we had in 2002, Santorum awarding Sandusky this award as one of the
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:01.240]  adoption angels.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:11.240]  It's quite clear that Penn State, Sandusky, Santorum are involved with one another, this
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:17.720]  whole practice, as I mentioned, of Santorum using his Senate office as a magnet and recruiting
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:22.520]  ground for staffers to go over to similarly inclined-
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:27.880]  And let's be clear, the sportswriter and newscaster who originally broke all this and forced it
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:33.040]  out in the open, he's been interviewed in Pennsylvania and said rich donors were coming
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:34.040]  there.
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:38.720]  Obviously, Sandusky's not raping children in the showers in broad daylight.
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.600]  If he didn't think, hey, this is, I mean, and of course the police and others, it turns
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.560]  out, knew 15 years ago and did nothing.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.840]  So this is the tip of the maggot pile.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:50.720]  Well, and here's another thing.
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.480]  I mentioned that Santorum was a member of the board of the Israel Project.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:14:06.200]  That outfit's chief spokesman and has now shown up at Penn State as the lawyer for Penn
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:14.040]  State to represent them in this whole pedophile scandal, and that guy is Lanny Davis.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:20.080]  So Lanny Davis, who worked with Rick Santorum at the Israel Project, now shows up at Penn
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:21.080]  State.
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:24.560]  Obviously, and many people think, he's there to cover up.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.440]  So there's a lot more to this than meets the eye.
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:32.960]  Covering Capitol Hill for decades, I mean, I get different numbers from different insiders,
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:38.680]  but I mean, obviously they corrupt a lot of them with the hookers you have under George
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:43.600]  Herbert Walker Bush, the hundreds of nighttime visits, Washington Times.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:49.440]  People just search Washington Times underage prostitute visits, you'll get mainstream articles.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.480]  You had it under George W. Bush, the male madam coming in.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.080]  You've got constantly them being caught in bathrooms everywhere.
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:00.840]  You got the Bohemian Grove, you got all of it, and it's just like, really?
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:03.240]  I mean, what do these guys do?
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:05.800]  So why did the system go for these guys?
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.360]  Because they know they can destroy them anytime they want.
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:14.680]  I mean, what percentage, I mean, we know Barney Frank, on record in the 80s, they found an
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:19.400]  underage prostitution ring being run out of his townhouse, and he gave a press conference.
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:23.800]  It's in the film I produced that just came out last year, Invisible Empire, a new order
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  to find.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:28.720]  And he said, look, if you don't stop bringing this up, I'm gonna give names, and they dropped
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:29.720]  the whole deal.
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:31.440]  I mean, how bad is it?
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:35.600]  I mean, a dead reckoning estimation here, Wayne.
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:42.720]  Well, Barney Frank, back when he gave that news conference, he also said that 25% of
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.840]  the members of the House were of the same persuasion, and he said, and as an aside,
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:50.440]  he said, and most of them are Republican.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:52.720]  Now, where are we at today?
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:57.680]  I think 25% is the lowest estimate, even using Frank's numbers.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:03.240]  I would say we're up probably around 45%, maybe even half.
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:08.600]  And the other thing I have to say is, obviously, Penn State being a nexus for this activity,
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:14.560]  that's another reason they hired Louie Freeh, the big cover-up, former director of the FBI,
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:18.080]  has been hired to be in charge of Penn State's internal-
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:23.200]  And they've hired the Merchead, I mean, you talk about vicious, he's involved.
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.760]  I mean, it's a who's who of dastardly characters.
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:35.480]  Absolutely, and the word I get from Penn State is, this is a virtual cult up here, it's a
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.640]  very hard cult to penetrate.
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:44.720]  I mean, football was the veneer, but when you peel back the football layer of this onion,
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.760]  you get into a lot more sordid activities, and I would suggest that one of the key actors
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:56.360]  in that whole episode from 1977 when he was working with Phil English and people like
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:01.680]  Terry Dolan and with the National College Republicans is one Rick Santorum, who is so
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:09.000]  viciously anti-homosexual, you have to wonder what is prompting him to do that, because
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.640]  the word I'm also getting from the gay community here in Washington is, look, we know all about
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:20.480]  Rick Santorum, Little Ricky, his communication director when he was in the Senate, openly
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.240]  gay African-American man, Robert Tranum, who still supports Santorum today.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:33.740]  And then we've got the whole history of TB, I won't say the name on air, Old Rove, a true
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:44.200]  demon of hell, it's just, it's unbelievable, I mean, it is so, and okay, well, just imagining
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:50.480]  all those people's marriage, hey, why do you think the NDAA legalized the military keeping
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:53.080]  goats and pigs on the base with them and bestiality?
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:58.200]  Well, that was kind of odd, I mean, when I served in the Navy, I can't say that was ever
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:04.760]  an issue, we had all kinds of other issues with activity, but I just don't recall anybody
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:12.680]  being involved in the barnyard sex in the Navy, but yeah, I was surprised to hear that,
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:19.520]  but maybe there's a reason for that as well, we do know that sometimes there's congressional
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:24.960]  delegations that visit some of these military bases overseas, for example, maybe it was
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:28.640]  to protect the animals from members of Congress and their senior staff members.
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:34.480]  Well, I mean, it's in there, they passed it.
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:40.560]  I was surprised to see it, I mean, that was an issue that, like I say, I had never realized
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:44.800]  that was an issue, I'm sure there were cases of that in the military, but nothing that
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:51.880]  would have risen to the point where Naval Investigative Service or some other investigative
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.760]  arm of the military would have had to conduct an investigation or court-martial somebody
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:58.760]  for it.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:04.680]  This country is really becoming a joke, and we're gonna come back with calls, I promise,
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:09.680]  folks, but the minute we've got left, NDAA, Obama's signing it, brief take on that, Wayne.
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:16.120]  Well, I think, again, this was another bait-and-switch operation, we now see Joe Lieberman starting
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:22.280]  to talk about deportation of people convicted of terrorism, look, we already had that poor
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:27.360]  girl down in Houston deported, a US citizen deported to Columbia, are we gonna see more
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:28.600]  cases of that?
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.120]  You know, I mean, if you're a natural born citizen, where are they gonna deport you to?
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:35.960]  In fact, wherever your forefathers hail from-
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:42.160]  Well, they're gonna deport you to a black site, because they strip you of the citizenship
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:47.280]  and the torture party begins by Christian leaders, Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for

[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:25.400]  All right, I've got a compilation of clips after I take some calls, because I haven't
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:26.400]  talked enough about this.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:33.000]  Obama and these recess appointments, they've not been in recess.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.080]  They've never even tried to bring them before the Congress.
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:40.600]  It is unprecedented power grab, just like launching wars without congressional approval.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:46.120]  So I wanna play a compilation of these clips coming up of Obama trying to sell the public
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:48.680]  on the idea, should I do things without Congress?
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:54.160]  And they're like, yay, get rid of them, we want a dictator, super creepy.
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.920]  Evert in Tennessee, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:57.920]  Thanks for holding.
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:58.920]  Yes, thank you.
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:05.240]  I just want to say real quick that we listened to you on WBCR here, our local radio station,
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:06.520]  1470 AM.
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.640]  1470 are just awesome folks, yes sir.
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:12.520]  And he's a great friend of mine.
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:18.360]  And I just want to say, ain't Obama on the security, the head of the security council,
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:22.080]  he sat there and don't our constitution prohibit that?
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:30.040]  And why is that, it's tying into him just going on, might possibly start a big war to
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:33.560]  finish this new world order that they want to have.
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:39.120]  And as soon I would think that we're seeing the mark of the beast when this stuff starts
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.120]  to happen.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:41.120]  Do you believe that?
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:49.440]  Yes, but they'll call it the mark of anti-Al-Qaeda, the mark of anti-terror, the mark of trusted
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:50.440]  traveler.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:52.880]  And I appreciate your call, great questions.
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:26:00.760]  Yes, there's a rotating membership with the members of the Security Council.
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:06.020]  And you, again, normally have one of your ambassadors sit on it.
[02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:10.960]  But this was the president sitting on it violating Article I, Section 9.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:16.040]  It's unprecedented, but so is all of this, just out of control corruption.
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:19.880]  Judy in Florida, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:26.120]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call, it's ironic that you're talking about what you are right
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:27.120]  now.
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:29.960]  There's two things that I was thinking about.
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:36.120]  I feel like my life has changed personally with the enactment of the NDAA, I mean, because
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:41.880]  I'm a vocal person, even though I'm a nobody, I send out emails to people-
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:46.560]  Oh yeah, I know, they want to set up a system where you disappear into the night, but they're
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:49.480]  doing that so you get scared and won't speak out.
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:52.960]  We have to totally speak out against what they're doing, and they're not gonna get away
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:54.120]  with it.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.520]  That's why they tried to pass it and claim it didn't affect citizens, and then say, well,
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:00.560]  don't worry, we won't use it against you.
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:06.880]  So I mean, it should concern you, like with a heightened awareness that, wow, these really
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:07.880]  are criminals.
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.040]  Yes, it is a wake up call.
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:13.240]  And I'm going to continue all that I'm doing.
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:18.760]  I know that my friends are, and they're all essentially Ron Paul supporters, or they're
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:20.720]  just supporters of freedom.
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:26.520]  And the other thing that I wanted to ask, I mean, to me, it seems very logical, although
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.120]  I don't know how to go about it.
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:34.520]  I know the avenues that I've tried to go through in order to talk to key individuals to get
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:42.160]  it pushed, but why can't Obama get impeached as soon as possible because of everything
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.560]  that he's done that's natural treason in this country?
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:54.040]  Because as Ron Paul's top advisor, Bruce Finis, pointed out, most of them, Democrat and Republican,
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:56.360]  are voting for everything Obama's doing.
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:00.320]  I mean, people that call themselves conservative, well, then you should love Obama cuz Mitt
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:05.260]  Romney is exactly the same person.
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:11.120]  Another teleprompter reading, Kendall, who's well kept and manicured, but is a globalist
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:12.600]  stooge.
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:17.020]  And now there was some talk on the House floor last week about impeaching him over these
[02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:18.320]  recess appointments.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:22.400]  Because there's not even a recess that's supposed to go on for close to a year before you can
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.400]  even discuss it.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:28.200]  It's an emergency recess appointment for, now he's trying to permanently appoint people
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:33.840]  without even getting congressional approval for them and violating federal law.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.700]  But I mean, he violated the law bombing Libya.
[02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:40.400]  He violated the law shutting down power plants.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:45.320]  He violates the law, I mean, no one has ever done as much as Obama.
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.160]  He is the most corrupt.
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:53.600]  But as I've said, it's just gonna get worse from here on out if they're a globalist puppet
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:56.920]  because the New World Order is in overdrive.
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:00.320]  I mean, it's not slow creeping world government anymore.
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:06.000]  It's out in your face, out in the open, hey, we wanna censor free speech, hey, we wanna
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  arrest you.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.360]  Hey, we're training your neighbors to spy on you.
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:12.200]  Hey, we're training your kids in public school to spy on you.
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:14.680]  Hey, we're gonna forcibly inoculate you.
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:18.320]  Hey, we're gonna jack up your taxes and your power bills and rob you.
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:21.440]  I mean, it is a criminal feeding frenzy.
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.520]  You ever watch underwater footage of sharks getting into a feeding frenzy and start biting
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:26.520]  each other?
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:30.760]  I mean, it's just a frothing, no one's up there blocking criminality.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:34.000]  So it's not even an organized criminal operation anymore.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.320]  I mean, they've got the basic New World Order system there, but it's just a grabbing and
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:46.160]  snatching and foaming and fighting and scrabbling around like a bunch of piranha rats on PCP
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:50.520]  who have rabies from the planet Gooblesnapper.
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:54.200]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:30:00.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:14.640]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:15.640]  you to have.
[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:16.640]  It's true.
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:21.080]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:25.660]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:29.400]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:33.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:36.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:41.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:45.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:46.760]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.760 --> 02:30:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:06.600]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs generator.
[02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:11.440]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:15.440]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:20.080]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:25.320]  The Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:31.580]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.580 --> 02:31:35.880]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:41.240]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs generator.
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:46.480]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:52.400]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:54.000]  the Silver Lungs generator.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:01.600]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:05.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:08.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:13.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:14.360]  at home.
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:19.400]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling
[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:20.400]  the shots.
[02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:25.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:30.880]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:35.560]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:37.960]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:38.960]  They're asking for more matches.
[02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:42.080]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check-out to?
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:47.920]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:48.920]  of the Republic.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:55.840]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:09.640]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:17.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:37.400]  Radio Network.
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:38.400]  You know what?
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:45.600]  A call like the last one I had from that nice lady, we're going to Gazelle, Eric and others
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:53.200]  here in just a moment, upsets me because that's what these tyrants count on.
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:56.400]  When they start admitting, yeah, we're listening to your phones without warrants, yeah, we're
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:34:00.780]  training your kids to spy on you, yeah, we got face scanning cameras up, yeah, we're
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.900]  training your neighbors to report your guns.
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:08.060]  It's meant to scare all of us into hiding.
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:14.360]  And that's why I had even been conditioned five, six, seven years ago when open carry
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:22.760]  groups in Arizona, Vermont, and Texas would show up at town squares.
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:26.840]  They'd show up at public events with their firearms on their sides.
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:30.200]  I understood it was their right.
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.700]  But I thought, well, that's provocative, my gosh, they're getting arrested.
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:36.240]  But they were going to court and winning, it was their right.
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:44.040]  They are the equivalent in the 2000s as Rosa Parks in the late 1950s.
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:48.620]  And people like her saying, you know what, I'm tired, I'm not gonna go, there's a front
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:53.560]  seat right here, I'm sitting here, it's open, I'm not going to the back of the bus.
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:58.060]  And now police all over the country in just four or five years, when they see you with
[02:34:58.060 --> 02:35:04.320]  your shotgun, your rifle, your M16, your handgun, they're not swarming you or arresting you
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:06.080]  or freaking out on you.
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:11.900]  Because they wanna act like our freedom is like drugs, illegal drugs or going to the
[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:17.760]  porno shop and buying a Playboy magazine or whatever and sticking it in a bag, or like
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.440]  liquor in a brown paper bag, like something evil.
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:27.600]  Because you watch all these drama shows, all these sitcoms and cop shows, all of them,
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:33.700]  they're all set in New York, Chicago, or other total gun ban places.
[02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:38.120]  And it's always, in your apartment, your neighbor saw a gun, you're going to jail, that's 20
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:39.120]  years, pal.
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:45.440]  And I go back to this, cuz this happened, and it was the big local cleaner place.
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:49.360]  And I even ended up having, it was a two man team, one guy got mad and quick that day and
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:54.720]  ended up calling into my AXS TV show, I can't even say in 12 years, it was like 14, 15.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:59.920]  I'm over there at my house, back then I broadcast out of my house, had a studio in it.
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:10.400]  And there's this shotgun, just a Winchester Defender, like a $250 pump shotgun.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.960]  Cuz I want low tech if I'm asleep or there's a problem, I want an easy to control shotgun
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:19.000]  or something like that.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.560]  And I hear an argument going on back there, it's about three o'clock in the afternoon,
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.720]  they got there after the radio show.
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:29.840]  And I'm in there making a sandwich, talking to my girlfriend, we weren't married yet.
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:33.400]  And I hear kind of, no, no, that's okay, it's okay, no, no, no, you don't have to do that,
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.400]  no, you're allowed to have that in Texas.
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:42.200]  And it turned out the white guy was from some big eastern city, I forget which one, that
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:47.000]  was a Hispanic Texan, but he was the assistant, the guy that carries it around behind him.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.020]  Cuz I actually worked for a carpet cleaner place and was the assistant one summer.
[02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:52.920]  But the point is, I go, what's the problem?
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.840]  The guy's like, I'm not working here, there's a shotgun up there.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:57.320]  And I said, you never seen a gun case?
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:58.800]  He goes, well, that's not the case.
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:05.360]  I go, yeah, it's a gun rack, it's right there, it's fine, he goes, is it loaded?
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:09.680]  And I said, well, yeah, actually it is, I don't have any kids around here, and the guy
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:10.680]  starts leaving.
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:15.760]  And I go, hey, here's the newspaper, two days ago, I led a gun rally, here's my picture.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:22.080]  See, guns aren't illegal, I caught bribery, cuz that had just happened like a week before,
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:26.440]  so I was showing him the Austin American Statesman, see, I'm on the paper, the cover of Metro
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.440]  and State.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:29.560]  And the guy's like, no, I'm getting out of here.
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:33.360]  And I was like, whoa, so then I got a bad feeling about two hours later, and I call
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  the place.
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:38.840]  And they go, yes, Mr. Jones, we all know who you are, no, the police were not called, though
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:40.600]  they almost were.
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:43.520]  And I kinda got lectured, and I was like, wow, that happened.
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:51.560]  Again, I can't have a shotgun in my house in America?
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:56.600]  And they count on intimidating us out of our rights and out of our liberties and out of
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:58.800]  our basic freedoms, and I'm sick of it.
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:06.600]  So I salute all of you that open carry and put up with being arrested, beat up, you name
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:07.600]  it.
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:13.860]  But in hundreds of cases of one, saying I have a right to carry my firearms in almost
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:19.800]  every state in the union, that's how you push back, you exercise a right.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:23.480]  They pass some fake environmental law that you can't fix your barn or build a barn, just
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:24.480]  do it.
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:25.480]  How about everybody does it?
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:26.600]  Everybody pays the fines.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:31.040]  I mean, it's getting to the point now, the government's so lawless and criminal that
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:32.800]  it's time to stop complying.
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:36.600]  You don't have to fight every battle, but just if you work for the system, I understand
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:39.640]  pretty much that's all that's left now for a lot of you out there.
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:45.120]  Just don't go along with everything, don't be so thug-like, don't be so happy to nail
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:50.260]  people to the wall, don't be so into tyranny.
[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:55.700]  And for people out there that are intimidated, this is meant to intimidate you when Lindsey
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:38:59.800]  Graham gets up there and hops around and says, I want you to have no lawyer, it is for citizens,
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:02.280]  I want you to be scared.
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:06.920]  They want to intimidate you so you shut up and then they win.
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:11.480]  Here's an analogy, you're walking through, let's say you're 12 years old, your mom drops
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:16.680]  shop at the mall, you're back out to meet her or whatever, and a man runs up and grabs
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:17.680]  you by the arm.
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:21.320]  Do you bite him, do you kick him, do you yell, do you scream?
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:24.600]  Or do you, cuz he says, just get in the car and you'll be okay.
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:26.160]  You're not gonna be okay getting in the car.
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:30.640]  The new lawyer's got us by the arm, of course, we're about a 10,000 pound gorilla, they're
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:35.240]  a little wart-covered, chicken-necked, buck-toothed little vampire.
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:40.460]  We're like an 8,000 pound gorilla with just giant steel muscles, power, the light of God
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:42.040]  shining in our eyes like thunderbolts.
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:45.800]  And this little vampire comes up and grabs us by the arm, we just roll over on our belly
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:46.800]  and just shake in fear.
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:51.000]  And it's got a little black uniform on, the vampire strutting around, telling us how tough
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  it is.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:57.520]  And it grabs us by the arm, and we just start urinating on ourselves like a dog, roll over
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:39:59.160]  on our back, groveling in fear.
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:03.080]  It's a total game.
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:12.760]  Together collectively, we're an 8,000 pound gorilla with muscles of pure steel.
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:21.760]  Now individually, I'm kinda like a squirrel to the little five foot buck-toothed vampire.
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.720]  And it might be able to catch me and grab me and stick its little rotten fangs in me
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:27.880]  and kill me, okay?
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:31.800]  But let me tell you, us collectively, I mean, they're scared to death of us.
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:37.800]  We're fire-breathing 8,000 pound gorilla that shoots laser beams out of its eyes.
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.560]  And you've got a slug-like vampire that has to gnaw on you for about an hour just to get
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:44.560]  blood.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:50.600]  I mean, it's that pathetic, and I'm not scared of it.
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:53.480]  I fear God and that's it, okay?
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:55.760]  And that's what we have to start seeing them as.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:57.800]  Don't let it intimidate you.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:04.000]  All these checkpoints and TSA, hands down the pants, it's all meant to break our will.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.320]  So if you have to travel, have to go through it, rebuke it, speak out against it, stand
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.200]  up against it, sue them, whatever.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:15.960]  Just let them know, I know what you're doing, vampire, and you don't get the pleasure of
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:18.780]  my fear cuz they drink fear.
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:19.780]  They do, they drink fear.
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:21.680]  All right, I wanna go to these clips.
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.600]  The first one is a compilation that we showed last Friday on the Nightly News.
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:32.540]  But this is Obama, and there's hundreds of these in speeches saying Congress is the problem.
[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:35.800]  Should I act without Congress, boy, it'd be a lot easier if I didn't have Congress.
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:41.000]  If I could just do whatever I want, getting the crowds to cheer, he's like a parrot testing
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  its perch.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.440]  A parrot will test to see if a branch is safe.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:48.200]  He's testing, and the system's testing, he's being told.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:53.000]  Test the perch, see if they'll bend over for enslavement, see if they'll let us put handcuffs
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.340]  on them.
[02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:56.340]  That's what they're doing.
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:59.600]  The TSA is all for their pedophile training of children, all of it.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:06.700]  They're just a pack of ruthless, buck-toothed, cross-eyed, wart-covered, chicken-neck vampires
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:09.000]  that can't even hardly walk, spiritually.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  I mean, they're a joke.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.720]  They are bug-eyed, blind zombies.
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:19.280]  I don't understand the fear of them.
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:22.180]  And a whole pack of them may grab me, a little squirrel and eat me.
[02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:27.880]  I don't even care, as long as I expose them all.
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:30.600]  Now we're gonna continue with other rodent analogies.
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:37.800]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Obama openly here trying to sell you dictatorship.
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:41.600]  I can fix everything, just let me do whatever I want.
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:44.280]  We've heard that before in history, here it is.
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:47.880]  The Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission.
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:52.620]  So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to
[02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:58.640]  pass this problem on to another generation of Americans.
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:11.640]  I know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:21.280]  I know there's some folks who wish I could just bypass Congress.
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:23.360]  Super creepy.
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.680]  I can.
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:31.960]  I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own.
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:33.960]  Believe me.
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:36.800]  And- Cheering for tyranny.
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:39.360]  Yes, yes, we're idiots.
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:41.080]  We really think you're good.
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:47.440]  Remember the very same bankers Bush was.
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:56.240]  And believe me, right now, dealing with Congress, the idea-
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:03.560]  Yes, we can get rid of Congress.
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:06.000]  Those folks will take your guns in a minute.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:16.880]  Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting.
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:22.160]  And then we've got him being sworn in, saying he'd protect and defend the Constitution.
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:28.160]  Yeah, one of the people he's putting forward with these recess appointments, without ever
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:32.800]  trying to actually get them through Congress, was named Chief Operating Officer of Citigroup's
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:34.840]  Alternative Investments Unit.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:42.120]  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and it just goes over all of that.
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:48.360]  Yeah, replacing another mob boss, Daley, I mean literal mafia.
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:56.040]  So this is the type of garbage that we deal with.
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:02.120]  Man, it makes my head spin.
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:06.040]  William Daley is resigning as White House Chief of Staff, and the Budget Chief, Jack
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:07.960]  Lew, will take his place.
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.800]  And no need to get him appointed.
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:13.600]  Who needs Congress, and you can launch a war without him, whatever you want.
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:17.960]  Here's another clip from Real Clear Politics of Obama being creepy.
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:18.960]  Here it is.
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:26.200]  These are ideas that have support from Democrats, they have support from Republicans around
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:27.680]  the country, independents around the country.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:32.800]  I wanna work with Congress to get them done.
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:41.440]  But when Congress refuses to act, and as a result, hurts our economy and puts our people
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:48.160]  at risk, then I have an obligation as President to do what I can without them.
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:54.120]  Now hit pause for a minute.
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:58.160]  See this is more recent, just a few weeks ago, or like a week ago.
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:45:59.160]  This is what's happening.
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:04.400]  See, first, the last three years, it'd be great to not have Congress, but unfortunately,
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:06.760]  I gotta follow the law.
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:10.680]  And then a few months later, maybe it would be good if they weren't there, maybe I will
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:11.680]  do what I want.
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:16.440]  And now, years later, yep, I'm doing what I can, launching war, shutting down power
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:17.440]  plants.
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.360]  And they're just like, yay, destroy the country faster.
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:27.080]  This new Lew guy's involved in all these energy companies and payoffs, and I mean, it's just
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:28.080]  mind blowing.
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:33.640]  Let's go back to the rest of the club.
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:37.680]  I've got an obligation to act on behalf of the American people.
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:38.680]  The foreign bankers?
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:44.040]  Stand by while a minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people that we
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:45.040]  were elected to serve.
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:46.040]  You're not gonna stand by.
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:50.760]  Not at this make or break moment for middle class Americans.
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:51.760]  We're not gonna let that happen.
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:52.760]  No, he's gonna help you.
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:54.120]  He cares so much about you.
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:55.120]  That's enough.
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:56.120]  Thank you.
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:57.120]  It goes on and on.
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:01.680]  This is the guy when Congress wouldn't give approval for the Libya situation.
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:03.800]  He just said, well, I get my authority from the UN.
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:07.440]  I mean, there's no reason to even have a Congress.
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:09.880]  And I'm not saying they're gonna save us either.
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.840]  They're a bunch of crooks that need to be impeached.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:17.880]  And again, it's out of this extreme criminality, this extreme arrogance towards the rule of
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:23.160]  law, Constitution, checks and balances, our protections, common sense, what makes America
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.120]  America, that they sit there.
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:32.440]  It's like a bunch of body snatchers pointing at Ron Paul like he's the guy that's the weirdo.
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:36.800]  When really, I mean, if you study the Constitution Bill of Rights, Ron Paul is just following
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:41.960]  the Constitution, but it's so alien today.
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:46.360]  Because we've gone so far down this rat hole.
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:49.600]  Gazelle in Texas, thanks for holding them, we're gonna get to Eric and others.
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:50.600]  Go ahead, Gazelle.
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:56.840]  Is this a Cobra Commander, Cobra currency will replace your dollar.
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:03.720]  I agree with the World Bank and I love what's happening with the checkpoints, Cobra agrees.
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:06.760]  Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:11.400]  I wanted to, Alex, I wanted to know if you had heard about a series on Showtime called
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:12.880]  Homeland.
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:18.400]  Yes, I know they've got a bunch of different made for TV shows, but also reality shows
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:22.200]  where Homeland Security teaches us how great it is to have checkpoints everywhere.
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:24.080]  It's all part of the dog training.
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:32.480]  Yes, actually, the premise of this show follows a CIA officer who is the hero in the show
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:37.280]  and two POWs, which are the black hats in the show.
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.920]  And they come back from the Middle East and they return after being MIA for several years,
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:48.360]  only to be covert al-Qaeda sleeper cells within the US.
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:55.720]  And what I think is most notable about the series is that it was revealed on NBC Nightly
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:02.440]  News and other sources that Obama is a fan of the show and that he watches it.
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:10.920]  No, they always, they had a Homeland Security celebration for 24 before it got canceled,
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.240]  worshipping it because it taught everyone to like torture.
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:20.280]  I mean, it's just so sick, but I know they also have a real Homeland Security show that
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.920]  follows Homeland Security around while they do all of their miscreant behavior.
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.560]  It's come out that Obama lets the illegal aliens, even felons, go.
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:29.560]  We already knew this.
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:34.760]  Sheriffs have said this for a year, but now it's confirmed that they have hotlines for
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:39.720]  the illegals when they're in a jail for even committing a regular crime and the Fed comes
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:40.720]  and gets them out.
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:45.560]  I mean, I ought to change my name to some illegal alien name and just prance around
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:49.560]  and be above the law and pay no taxes and be worshiped as supreme leader.
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:56.480]  Indeed, I guess what's so disappointing about this is that this is basically the MIAC report
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:02.840]  depicted to a T with returning veterans depicted as threats and not-
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:07.640]  Well, yeah, and again, they're not depicting them as somebody who's gonna get mad and kill
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.440]  themselves or their wife.
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:14.040]  They're depicting them as Al-Qaeda and that's what they say in these manuals.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:19.480]  They actually teach it, we've published them, the police have sent us, and it's just a joke.
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:23.480]  I mean, obviously, the terrorists run the government and the terrorists are trying to
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:26.200]  use Homeland Security against the American people.
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  It's never been about Al-Qaeda.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:32.440]  I mean, Al-Qaeda works for the criminals that run our country publicly.
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:33.800]  I've got to get some snippets of it.
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:34.800]  I'm sure it's online.
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:35.840]  I knew an article about it.
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:38.120]  Thanks for the heads up.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:45.800]  Eric in Colorado, and then Robert Raymond, we'll get to most of you on the other side.
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:47.540]  I keep forgetting to plug this, by the way.
[02:50:47.540 --> 02:50:50.320]  We have the best gravity fed filters out there.
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:53.060]  We tested a bunch of them and looked at all the ratings.
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:54.580]  They blow all the competition away.
[02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:59.760]  It's pro pure gravity fed stainless steel water filters available at Infowars.com.
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:02.840]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:49.160]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:50.640]  and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:53.040]  The war is here.
[02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:54.920]  It's an info war.
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:52:02.200]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:03.780]  Don't answer it.
[02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.760]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector,

[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:43.360]  Thank you for holding, good to talk to you.
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:47.880]  Alex, hey, how about that Tim Tebow?
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:53.560]  Yeah, that's all I'm worried about is that football is great and they're setting up federal
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:57.080]  checkpoints where they grab your genitals, but hey, that's what freedom is about.
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:01.360]  And they're openly pushing for inoculation and DNA databases when you get pulled over
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.960]  and but the border is wide open and the government publicly ships drugs in and guns out.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:08.960]  So everything's great, yep.
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:12.280]  Just wondering your thoughts on the man.
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:16.560]  I mean, it was a great game last night, don't know if you caught it or not, but-
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:23.080]  No, but I see it just here and there and read about it and I'm glad that he's a Christian.
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:26.120]  I know he's been criticized for that.
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:31.340]  But I wonder if he's the type of Christian that thinks nuking anyone who isn't a Christian
[02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:32.340]  is Christian.
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:36.600]  If he's that type of Christian, I don't like him.
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:39.200]  What type of Christian is he?
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.640]  Not sure, not sure, I think Southern Baptist.
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:43.360]  I know he was homeschooled.
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:46.880]  Yeah, he was.
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:47.880]  Very interesting.
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:48.880]  Other than that.
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.400]  Well, I wonder what he thinks of the fact the government wants to secretly arrest citizens
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:56.680]  and have us disappear into black holes.
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:01.320]  I wonder if that's important or just praying to God that he wins football games.
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:06.920]  Cuz see, I'd pray to God that they not release a deadly bioweapon that they've been producing.
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:09.240]  I would pray to God that we not have World War III.
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:11.880]  I would pray to God that the honeybees stop dying in mass.
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:12.880]  You know what I mean?
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:13.880]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:16.560]  I would pray to God that they stop putting flora in the water.
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:20.440]  I would pray to God that we didn't have the highest cancer rate in the world and Alzheimer's
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:27.040]  exploding and just plagues upon us while we worship television and mindlessness.
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:33.200]  You see, let's go ahead and talk to Robert in California.
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:34.200]  Robert, welcome.
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:35.200]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:36.200]  How are you?
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:37.200]  Good, sir.
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:43.660]  Yeah, I came up with an interesting idea and I live in the Bay Area and I went down to
[02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:47.160]  United Nations Plaza like the week before Christmas.
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:55.080]  And I polled 232 people about whether they'd prefer world government to national sovereignty.
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:57.080]  So I thought you'd find that interesting.
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:56:58.080]  And what did they say?
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.440]  Well, I got 21% for world government.
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:05.640]  And that's even in San Francisco where you're brainwashed with it.
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:08.880]  That's where our government started the U.N. there, as you know.
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:09.880]  Exactly.
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:11.400]  So I gave them home-field advantage.
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:14.240]  I did it in the most liberal city in the world.
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:20.040]  And I also used the leading question, I said, would you prefer world government or national
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:21.040]  sovereignty?
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:25.640]  You see, the globalists say they know best, so what you want doesn't matter because it's
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:27.280]  liberal and trendy.
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:33.440]  Yeah, but I also asked them their age and I kept track of their race and I did a little
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:37.880]  bit of an analysis of the demographic and you'd find this really interesting.
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:42.360]  If you look at who is for world government, you could probably guess.
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:48.280]  I would imagine that kind of academic establishment, government worker types?
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:49.280]  Uh-uh.
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:50.280]  No.
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:58.280]  I mean, virtually every Latino I asked or Hispanic was for it because there's no border.
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:00.640]  Virtually every homeless person I asked was for it.
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:04.760]  You know, I had people tell me, well, government, I'd see them taken out of garbage can an hour
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:09.600]  later or one guy said, well, government, and then threatened to beat me up if I didn't
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:12.320]  give him a dollar or two, you know.
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:17.440]  Well, the world government wants to kill everybody, the majority of the population, wow.
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:22.040]  You want to videotape that and show a composite and put it on YouTube, it'd be a big hit.
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:27.680]  You know, I'm just a regular guy, I need all of you, I mean, to be doing the same thing.
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:34.480]  Access TV, local radio shows, put it on YouTube, start fighting, start getting the word out.
