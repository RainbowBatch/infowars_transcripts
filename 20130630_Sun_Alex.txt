[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30.000 --> 00:41.600]  My friends, it is the 30th day of June 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going
[00:41.600 --> 00:50.040]  to be live here for the next two hours as we are every single Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central
[00:50.040 --> 00:57.080]  back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central. Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us in
[00:57.080 --> 01:00.600]  the second hour for three of the segments.
[01:00.600 --> 01:06.080]  Wayne did work at the National Security Agency. He's testified to Congress before about illegal
[01:06.080 --> 01:14.400]  spying over a decade ago. And Wayne was in a big London Guardian article yesterday that
[01:14.400 --> 01:20.040]  got pulled from the Guardian and the Observer, one of the biggest group of publications in
[01:20.040 --> 01:32.760]  the UK. It got pulled, and then at the same time, they even went into the Google system,
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.040]  which I've never seen before, and took it out of the Google Wayback Machine.
[01:37.040 --> 01:42.960]  In fact, if we punch up my middle computer, folks can see it there if you're watching
[01:42.960 --> 01:48.280]  on prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com forward slash show. We now offer the radio show free
[01:48.280 --> 01:51.760]  everybody while we can pay for the bandwidth, and subscribers get the nightly news and all
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.680]  the films, the rest of it. Our goal is just to get the word out, period.
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.520]  That's why we're putting that out so people can actually see it if you're a radio listener.
[01:59.520 --> 02:09.980]  But shocking NSA scoop on Saturday, the Guardian revealed a major NSA scoop, then deleted it
[02:09.980 --> 02:14.440]  from their website. I saw this in the Business Insider this morning, posted up on infowars.com,
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.200]  so I called Wayne. And on his site, he has it archived, but other than that, it's gone.
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.480]  You click on the Google Wayback Machine, and I actually searched the article headline in
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.520]  a fresh search of their site. I clicked on this this morning, and it was there. It's
[02:31.520 --> 02:35.520]  now gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35.520 --> 02:44.100]  That's the type of stuff that is going on. Now continuing here, look at it, there's the
[02:44.100 --> 02:49.740]  Wayne Madsen right there revealed secret European deals to hand over private data to America.
[02:49.740 --> 02:57.320]  This has been known forever, that this has been declassified over and over again, that
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.280]  is called Infopole 9, basically over Europe. And it's the same grid, and they all share,
[03:02.280 --> 03:04.720]  and Europeans can then listen to us.
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.860]  So see, the Europeans are out in the press going, how dare America, we would never put
[03:08.860 --> 03:15.960]  up with this. I saw an article two years ago where a guy was in France, and he said, man,
[03:15.960 --> 03:23.040]  this is the bomb going to this sporting event, and he was arrested. And then you've seen
[03:23.040 --> 03:27.880]  examples of Europeans coming over here and others saying, man, we're coming to America
[03:27.880 --> 03:32.680]  to tear the place down, and here comes the FBI.
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.280]  They're reading the emails, the text, listening, that is on record. They're only going after
[03:38.280 --> 03:44.120]  Snowden and people because they're saying it's morally wrong. So they're really going
[03:44.120 --> 03:48.800]  after their free speech. They're going after Greenwald's speech interviewing somebody like
[03:48.800 --> 03:53.920]  Snowden and having David Gregory on NBC say arresting, and it is disgusting.
[03:53.920 --> 03:59.160]  So there it is, revealed secret European deals to hand over private data to America, that's
[03:59.160 --> 04:04.120]  up on Infowars.com. And then we're linked to the new article to Wayne Madsen putting
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.360]  out a report today responding to all this, it is a big deal. We tend to have Wayne on
[04:09.360 --> 04:12.000]  so much every few months, people think, that's just Wayne Madsen.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.240]  Folks, he worked at the NSA, he worked before that in Navy security, and he worked in the
[04:18.240 --> 04:26.640]  Naval War College. And he has testified to Congress and he has the sources. But he's
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.720]  going after a European Commission that admitted it a decade ago. And James Bamford's book
[04:31.720 --> 04:36.440]  12 years ago, Body of Secrets that Exposed Operation Northwoods, among other things.
[04:36.440 --> 04:43.680]  So he'll be joining us. We've got all the other news first though. We've got reports
[04:43.680 --> 04:50.800]  out there right now, they're planning massive rioting. What did that story go mega viral?
[04:50.800 --> 04:56.640]  Folks are planning that if Zimmerman doesn't get convicted, we'll be covering that and
[04:56.640 --> 05:02.160]  a lot more. Stay with us. There is an increased need to support our
[05:02.160 --> 05:07.920]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[05:07.920 --> 05:13.620]  a full selection of silver based products. Our most popular silver based products are

[06:16.640 --> 06:36.120]  waiting for war. Waging war on corruption. Crashing the lies
[06:36.120 --> 06:42.880]  and disinformation. I'm your host Alex Jones and we're live the 30th day of June this Sunday
[06:42.880 --> 06:51.660]  2013 and we've got a very important Pro Liberty transmission jam packed with truth and decisive
[06:51.660 --> 07:00.440]  research coming up so stay with us. Again folks coming up in the second hour a real
[07:00.440 --> 07:08.680]  NSA insider whistle blower will be joining us Wayne Madsen. A big cover story in the
[07:08.680 --> 07:17.480]  London Guardian slash Observer came out yesterday and was de-noticed by the British government.
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.040]  They have national security declarations over there where they can shut the press down.
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.880]  Very authoritarian. Under the so called US government request they have been slapping
[07:25.880 --> 07:31.280]  down scores of mainstream media reports about illegal spying and how Europe and the UK is
[07:31.280 --> 07:37.440]  working with the criminals that run our government to engage in this type of activity. And Wayne
[07:37.440 --> 07:43.880]  Madsen story that was up on the Guardian that was on a retraction. There was not a anything.
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.080]  It went out in the print edition of the newspaper nationwide and into Europe. It's one of the
[07:48.080 --> 07:56.160]  biggest English speaking papers in Europe. If not the biggest. It went out but they removed
[07:56.160 --> 08:02.240]  it off of the online. And we have screenshots of it at the bottom of the article on info
[08:02.240 --> 08:11.880]  wars.com. They removed it. And now they have removed it from the Google cash system that
[08:11.880 --> 08:19.800]  I've never seen Google. Remove something from its cash. So that has all been disappeared
[08:19.800 --> 08:26.760]  and we have links to that. You can see up on info wars.com and exclusively Wayne Madsen
[08:26.760 --> 08:31.960]  will be joining us. He's talked to the newspaper. It was the government quote putting pressure
[08:31.960 --> 08:34.520]  on them to remove it.
[08:34.520 --> 08:39.440]  But as Madsen pointed out over the phone, I said, well, wait, the stuff you talk about,
[08:39.440 --> 08:44.560]  you're smart. Like Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program, the weaponized
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.360]  space system before that Colonel Bowman in the Air Force. You're smart like that engineer
[08:50.360 --> 08:55.240]  and nuclear physicist Bob Bowman. He'll come on and talk about space weapons, but only
[08:55.240 --> 08:58.560]  what's been accidentally leaked by other people.
[08:58.560 --> 09:02.660]  Only what's been gotten out by the press in the past, he can come out and say what's accurate
[09:02.660 --> 09:08.600]  and what isn't. And he talked about on C-SPAN debating the current head of the Star Wars
[09:08.600 --> 09:14.760]  program in the late 80s. And the guy got real angry with him and started releasing a bunch
[09:14.760 --> 09:22.260]  of classified stuff. And so he was then able to talk about that because his former colleague
[09:22.260 --> 09:24.560]  got angry and was blurting it out.
[09:24.560 --> 09:30.840]  And the truth is, it's like General Petraeus, as the head of the CIA last year, now defrocked,
[09:30.840 --> 09:37.520]  disgraced, kicked out in one of those interagency wars, was at a technology conference put on
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.560]  by Wired magazine. And he said, look, we got wireless internet looking through your walls.
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.960]  He said, look, all your new appliances have microphones, cameras, your dishwasher is watching
[09:47.960 --> 09:59.440]  you. And of course, we're listening to everything you're doing. But it's for your safety. So
[09:59.440 --> 10:10.760]  because he was promoting it from a perspective of this spying illegally is good for you,
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.200]  and to keep you safe from the bad men, like we're two years old and really believe these
[10:16.200 --> 10:18.560]  fairy tales.
[10:18.560 --> 10:26.160]  Then you don't go to jail. But if you're Edward Snowden and you come out and you say, hey,
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.760]  they're spying on everybody illegally. These are the programs that are in place. And I
[10:30.760 --> 10:36.000]  think it's terrible and I can't go on living like this anymore. Then they've got to call
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.240]  you a traitor and an enemy and a piece of trash and say you've endangered America and
[10:43.240 --> 10:49.040]  get all sycophantic about national security when the globalists are the ones destroying
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.240]  our industry, our sovereignty, and our security.
[10:52.240 --> 10:59.480]  So I'm gonna talk to the people out there like David Gregory of Meet the Press who with
[10:59.480 --> 11:09.720]  extreme salivation had Greenwald of The Guardian on last Sunday and said, hey, you ought to
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.200]  be arrested. We played the clip last Sunday. You ought to be arrested. Maybe you should
[11:14.200 --> 11:24.360]  be arrested. And I mean, this is so outrageous. The spying is illegal on record without warrants.
[11:24.360 --> 11:30.600]  This is part of the war on journalists. They're using the NSA on the Associated Press and
[11:30.600 --> 11:36.200]  on Fox News. They're arresting members of the State Department that talk to Fox News
[11:36.200 --> 11:40.240]  or to this show for that matter.
[11:40.240 --> 11:45.420]  People go to the State Department to the cafeteria, meet with them and go, what's your view as
[11:45.420 --> 11:50.360]  a top analyst on North Korea? Are they capable of you think really launching a nuclear weapon
[11:50.360 --> 11:56.080]  at Japan? Well, yes, we think they're crazy enough. They are unstable enough to do it
[11:56.080 --> 12:00.520]  and we don't think they're planning to but they are dangerous and we believe they have
[12:00.520 --> 12:01.520]  three weapons.
[12:01.520 --> 12:07.320]  That's in the newspaper. And they went and arrested that guy and are talking about charging
[12:07.320 --> 12:16.520]  the Fox News head national security reporter. And that was in the news a month ago. And
[12:16.520 --> 12:21.840]  then they take Snowden. There's a bunch of whistleblowers. There's been AT&T, NSA whistleblowers.
[12:21.840 --> 12:24.400]  There's been a ton of them.
[12:24.400 --> 12:29.280]  James Bamford interviewed a bunch of whistleblowers and brought out more than Snowden did 12 years
[12:29.280 --> 12:35.120]  ago in body of secrets. We interviewed him. And mainly what he did was go and dig through
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.960]  the National Security Archives and then go and talk to retired people about what they
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.240]  could tell them about things in the archives.
[12:44.240 --> 12:48.160]  And mainly it was our so called government shipping narcotics around the world, our so
[12:48.160 --> 12:55.060]  called government running sex slavery, white slavery, our so called government staging
[12:55.060 --> 13:00.440]  terror attacks to blame foreign governments and take American liberty. That came out in
[13:00.440 --> 13:01.720]  ABC News, by the way.
[13:01.720 --> 13:09.720]  James Bamford used to be the producer, the news director of Nightline. You didn't know
[13:09.720 --> 13:18.140]  they've declassified over 200 instances of the US Army blowing stuff up to blame an enemy.
[13:18.140 --> 13:25.000]  I mean, our military says, well, we do this because other people do.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.560]  Yeah, I guess other people do. Operation Himmler was more than a dozen staged terror attacks
[13:30.560 --> 13:39.920]  to be blamed on Poland and countries like that to start World War II. I guess Operation
[13:39.920 --> 13:47.920]  Himmler did really work well for a while.
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.880]  So this is the type of stuff I deal with and that we all deal with when we're informed
[13:51.880 --> 13:58.160]  is hearing other talk show hosts literally salivate on air going Richard Snowden or Edward
[13:58.160 --> 14:05.840]  Snowden is a traitor. And all these people need to be arrested and we need to go after
[14:05.840 --> 14:12.400]  them and we need to go after people that try to hurt America and all this business.
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.360]  He didn't give out ICBM information. He didn't give out cruise missile information. He didn't
[14:18.360 --> 14:25.200]  give out how many knots an aircraft carrier can move or steam as they call it, even though
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.520]  it's nuclear powered, they call it steam. I guess they call it cruise now. He didn't
[14:30.520 --> 14:38.300]  give out the classified speed of an Abrams M1A1 tank. They didn't give any of that out.
[14:38.300 --> 14:43.160]  He came out and said, we are spying on everybody in the middle of a huge scandal where they
[14:43.160 --> 14:49.760]  were caught spying on the press and caught spying on the House cloakroom and the Senate
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.440]  cloakroom where people go to eat their lunch.
[14:53.440 --> 14:59.480]  The Justice Department has stinking microphones planted in there, totally illegal, totally
[14:59.480 --> 15:05.720]  illegal. And all of this comes out, ladies and gentlemen, and we've known this before,
[15:05.720 --> 15:11.720]  MI6 has been caught spying on the British Parliament. The bureaucracies and the special
[15:11.720 --> 15:17.620]  interests that control them are out of control. And that's the big national security threat
[15:17.620 --> 15:26.860]  is the 860 plus thousand private contractors with top secret and above top secret clearance.
[15:26.860 --> 15:34.000]  Most of them foreign owned companies here in the US who have access to all the NSA data.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.900]  Snowden worked for a private company. It happened to be American. The point is these are globalists
[15:39.900 --> 15:44.840]  that have taken over. They're dialed into all this and they're really using it for unfair
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.480]  trade advantage against companies that aren't on the inside scoop.
[15:48.480 --> 15:54.600]  It'd be like having a bug in your competition's office. OK, we're going to come back and break
[15:54.600 --> 16:01.080]  down the latest on the NSA scandal than a bunch of other news.
[16:01.080 --> 16:05.880]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[16:05.880 --> 16:11.580]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[16:11.580 --> 16:17.160]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.480]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.640]  be a problem? E Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll

[20:05.640 --> 20:26.120]  to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's
[20:26.120 --> 20:45.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. You think you've got private lives folks? Think nothing
[20:45.280 --> 20:52.940]  of the kind. There is no true escape. Big Brothers watching all the time. The only escape
[20:52.940 --> 20:58.160]  is not being intimidated by all this and standing up to the criminal interest that have hijacked
[20:58.160 --> 21:04.280]  our nation and restoring our republic. Now I want to get into a bunch of important crime
[21:04.280 --> 21:10.760]  news. The bizarre statements of Alec Baldwin, just because it shows the hypocrisy of the
[21:10.760 --> 21:16.760]  authoritarian left as I call them. We're going to get into US military build ups, not just
[21:16.760 --> 21:24.540]  in Jordan, but also in Israel by Gaza. And it's not even really getting any press here
[21:24.540 --> 21:25.540]  in the US.
[21:25.540 --> 21:32.520]  I mean, it's in Reuters. It's in France 24 on their national TV, but I've been monitoring
[21:32.520 --> 21:38.880]  TV and press here. There's very little coverage of it. It's a big deal. Here's the headline.
[21:38.880 --> 21:46.160]  Jordanian suspicious about US military deployment. The government, it says is the US had a drill
[21:46.160 --> 21:50.600]  there and then a month ago and then refused to leave. It's pretty bizarre. So we're gonna
[21:50.600 --> 21:51.600]  be looking at that.
[21:51.600 --> 21:56.960]  We're going to be, again, in depth looking at the NSA. But here's what I want to get
[21:56.960 --> 22:03.520]  across to everybody. We've all heard stories and seen convictions in news where 20 year
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.900]  old companies, 150 year old companies, 200 year old companies in some cases in Europe
[22:08.900 --> 22:18.200]  or older, where the CEO or the CFO or the president of the company or a managing director
[22:18.200 --> 22:25.160]  gets caught doing something illegal with the company, robbing thousands of people or overcharging
[22:25.160 --> 22:32.520]  millions or cheating or using company transport to ship in drugs.
[22:32.520 --> 22:38.560]  You've all seen countless articles and stories like that in the press. There's a lot of examples
[22:38.560 --> 22:48.000]  of it. It doesn't mean that everyone in the company is a criminal. It doesn't mean everybody
[22:48.000 --> 22:54.720]  that works for the organization is bad. When you get a bunch of people in a company operating
[22:54.720 --> 23:03.880]  as criminals, then you can call it organized crime.
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.600]  And when you look at our government and many other governments, I mean, most people will
[23:08.600 --> 23:16.960]  say, well, most governments are corrupt and are tyrannies and are oligarchies. Most governments
[23:16.960 --> 23:22.840]  are wildly corrupt and the police are oppressive and there's a surveillance state and there's
[23:22.840 --> 23:28.320]  checkpoints on the road and the police will rob you if they want or take blood from you
[23:28.320 --> 23:29.320]  at checkpoints.
[23:29.320 --> 23:35.280]  Or and you start going down the list, you're like, wow, that's a lot of places in America.
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.360]  And anyone who's honest will tell you America is declining culturally, spiritually, mentally
[23:41.360 --> 23:48.240]  and very, very many ways. And it's accelerating. And when you try to stand up against that
[23:48.240 --> 23:53.560]  decline, you get demonized by the mainstream media and you get demonized by a lot of the
[23:53.560 --> 24:01.160]  politicos that are out there. Because they've got a lot riding on America going quietly
[24:01.160 --> 24:02.760]  into the night.
[24:02.760 --> 24:14.680]  They've got a lot riding on the people standing down. And really all the New World Order is
[24:14.680 --> 24:23.600]  is a private, global, corporate takeover. And Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carol Quigley
[24:23.600 --> 24:32.720]  and Rothkopf and Henry Kissinger and countless others have all written books. Helmut Schmidt,
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.760]  the German Chancellor, Men in Powers, a political retrospective.
[24:36.760 --> 24:41.440]  There are countless books I've personally read where they announce their global corporate
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.640]  government and where they brag for 50, 60 years that they're above the law. They have
[24:48.640 --> 24:53.360]  diplomatic immunity, that the government ships in the narcotics, that the government runs
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.360]  every bad vice.
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.480]  And that select corporate individuals make the money off of it. But it's good because
[25:02.480 --> 25:10.080]  they're altruistic and they're only running the criminal enterprises so that bad people
[25:10.080 --> 25:16.400]  don't get control of it. See, they're in control of it because they'll make sure that it doesn't
[25:16.400 --> 25:22.240]  hurt innocent people that didn't ask for it.
[25:22.240 --> 25:27.200]  And what I'm giving you is the secrets of organized crime here. The mindset, the way
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.680]  it works, the way they think. And they all write books bragging how they're doing it
[25:32.680 --> 25:39.360]  and saying, hey, we're in control. We deserve to be in control. I've been approached by
[25:39.360 --> 25:45.120]  some of these guys on record and off record and said, look, the public would tear you
[25:45.120 --> 25:46.280]  limb from limb.
[25:46.280 --> 25:54.260]  They don't want freedom. You ought to join us. Well, I don't believe that. With the culture
[25:54.260 --> 26:03.800]  they sell, the dumbing down, the propaganda, all of that, undoubtedly, we have a decadent
[26:03.800 --> 26:09.920]  wicked society and the general public is a howling, dangerous mob of miscreants on average.
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.680]  But there is a large segment of society and I think bordering on a majority that is hard
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.120]  working, smart, good, decent, but they're overwhelmed by the complexity of the world,
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.980]  overwhelmed by the magnitude of the corruption.
[26:25.980 --> 26:30.520]  And they believe that they'd have to be able to fix the whole world with one magic button
[26:30.520 --> 26:37.840]  or lever they throw. And that's not how the universe works. But simply put, the New World
[26:37.840 --> 26:44.760]  Order is a corporate hostile takeover of not just the US, but every other country in the
[26:44.760 --> 26:52.920]  world. It is 2,000 major companies, this is all mainstream news now, that have access
[26:52.920 --> 26:55.460]  to most of the NSA data.
[26:55.460 --> 27:01.920]  It is the Fortune 100, roughly, and Google and Microsoft and Apple and AT&T and Verizon
[27:01.920 --> 27:08.200]  on record that are the NSA. They have the data centers. They administer the government
[27:08.200 --> 27:12.200]  centers, but most of it's in their centers. And I told you this a decade ago. I told you
[27:12.200 --> 27:18.320]  this 17 years ago, cuz it's all public. Wayne Madsen's coming on. He simply pointed to the
[27:18.320 --> 27:19.320]  Guardian.
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.360]  Here's the European Union Commission from a decade ago admitting this. When James Bamford's
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.080]  book came out on the NSA, the former head producer of Nightline, here's all the documents.
[27:29.080 --> 27:33.400]  Here's the name of the programs. Here's how they do it. Here's how they run it. And they
[27:33.400 --> 27:39.640]  shut that article down after less than 24 hours and even took it off Google cache, folks.
[27:39.640 --> 27:44.360]  And you know why they did? Because Wayne Madsen just walked out and said the emperor has no
[27:44.360 --> 27:51.440]  clothes. This is all public. This is in the Telecommunications Act of 96 in the US. This
[27:51.440 --> 27:58.960]  is in your telecommunications acts of 1997, 2003 in Europe.
[27:58.960 --> 28:07.440]  And they totally freaked out, ladies and gentlemen. You see, they like it when Snowden's running
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.920]  and scared cuz they can then act like he did something wrong. Get everybody to buy into
[28:11.920 --> 28:16.160]  it and call the guy a traitor when he is a hero. And they can have others call him a
[28:16.160 --> 28:19.280]  double agent. That guy's not a double agent.
[28:19.280 --> 28:22.720]  He's a double agent of the globalist. He's not like Lee Harvey Oswald they sent to Russia
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.440]  to defect or something. I've studied it, I've seen every angle. He's one of many people
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.840]  that tried to get away from this evil who they decided to pick as a cutout to then make
[28:33.840 --> 28:40.040]  the double agent by demonizing him and trying to scare everybody.
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.760]  And tell you, yeah, we're listening to you. And yeah, we torture people. And yeah, we
[28:43.760 --> 28:50.400]  ship in the drugs. What you gonna do about it? You see? Now I'm done talking about that
[28:50.400 --> 28:56.720]  to the next hour. Okay, we're live. It's Sunday right now. 30th of June 2013. We come back,

[31:05.720 --> 31:11.380]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[31:11.380 --> 31:16.960]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[31:16.960 --> 31:21.280]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there will really

[31:59.920 --> 32:04.560]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us? As we've moved through
[32:04.560 --> 32:09.760]  history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of
[32:09.760 --> 32:17.100]  dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche. From
[32:17.100 --> 32:22.780]  compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[32:22.780 --> 32:28.100]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback
[32:28.100 --> 32:32.080]  loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total
[32:32.080 --> 32:35.960]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of
[32:35.960 --> 32:41.120]  the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only
[32:41.120 --> 32:50.640]  endorse but demand war. State of mind because there's a war on for your mind. Get your copy

[33:18.680 --> 33:32.200]  Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. There is
[33:32.200 --> 33:36.640]  a new scandal involving the ATF that broke via USA Today.
[33:36.640 --> 33:45.720]  We have the background on it at infowars.com right now. ATF arming robbers in hatched plots
[33:45.720 --> 33:54.600]  that they hatch, leaving many dead ATF domestic sting operations, eclipse operation, past
[33:54.600 --> 34:01.520]  and furious. They go out and find people that they pressure to go out and commit crimes
[34:01.520 --> 34:05.960]  with illegal guns. So they can then point at that and call for all of us to lose our
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.940]  guns as their own internal memo showed on Fast and Furious, where they shipped thousands
[34:10.940 --> 34:15.900]  of guns into Mexico to then blame the Second Amendment when crimes were committed with
[34:15.900 --> 34:16.900]  them.
[34:16.900 --> 34:21.280]  That's called a false flag event. I'm gonna be getting to that more in just a moment and
[34:21.280 --> 34:25.920]  a bunch of other news I haven't covered yet. But first off, the July issue of Infowars

[34:52.320 --> 34:59.120]  months, maybe a year. We published three big infowars.com bumper stickers in it, outdoor
[34:59.120 --> 35:06.160]  bumper stickers, the high quality ones. This one has ten of them in it, four big ones,
[35:06.160 --> 35:07.160]  six little ones.
[35:07.160 --> 35:11.400]  I mean, little ones are medium size to put on your own property or legal in awful areas.
[35:11.400 --> 35:22.800]  Talk about an Infowars bomb in the Infowar. Again, it's got six medium size bumper stickers
[35:22.800 --> 35:31.680]  that you can stick wherever you want. And then it's got the four full-size ones. America
[35:31.680 --> 35:38.680]  has been occupied by globalist forces, infowars.com.

[35:46.440 --> 35:51.960]  infowars.com, forbidden information. And then listen to Alex Jones at infowars.com. Great
[35:51.960 --> 35:58.480]  way to wake people up. So ladies and gentlemen, we're talking ten bumper stickers.

[36:01.920 --> 36:07.280]  my audio had been kind of low in my earpiece. And it just suddenly clicked in and then I
[36:07.280 --> 36:11.960]  could hear it good. Wow, that was amazing. That was like the sun coming back or something.
[36:11.960 --> 36:16.700]  Wow, it was driving me crazy not being able to hear barely. That was neat.

[37:52.440 --> 37:58.320]  libertarians, infowarsstore.com. We're the only operation of its kind, a true libertarian
[37:58.320 --> 38:03.800]  constitutionalist that goes after both parties and exposes the inside scoops fearlessly.
[38:03.800 --> 38:08.800]  This is the biggest and best operation out there. We'd like to do a lot better job. And
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.960]  the more support we get, the more we can do it, infowarsstore.com. And lastly, support
[38:13.960 --> 38:19.360]  our local AM&FM affiliates. Spread the word about this broadcast. Whether you're listening
[38:19.360 --> 38:28.120]  to me here in Austin on 590 AM or in Chicago, if you're listening to us on 1530 or the 160
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.400]  plus AM&FM affiliates across the land.
[38:31.400 --> 38:37.640]  Okay, I'm done with the daily plug there, but that's also how we fund our operation.
[38:37.640 --> 38:42.120]  Let me get to this thing that I just mentioned here. And I'm gonna get Larry Pratt on this
[38:42.120 --> 38:48.000]  week of Gun Owners of America to break it down. But ATF arming robbers and hatching
[38:48.000 --> 38:56.220]  plots leaving many dead. ATF domestic sting operations eclipse operation fast and furious.
[38:56.220 --> 39:02.500]  And sting operations similar to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which left six dead.
[39:02.500 --> 39:09.220]  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are pressuring and arming people to rob fictitious
[39:09.220 --> 39:10.920]  drug stash houses.
[39:10.920 --> 39:17.280]  And the bust have left at least seven people dead, according to USA Today. Now remember,
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.200]  our government on record, the banks that have hijacked it, ship in most of the narcotics.
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.520]  Even Bloomberg reports that. They run the guns to the drug cartels, all of it. So they
[39:25.520 --> 39:31.400]  need low level idiots to bust for the media to make it look like they've done something.
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.400]  And it just goes on with a lot of legal scholars, constitutionalists saying this is illegal.
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.240]  This is beyond entrapment and it's very, very dangerous. And it's then used to blame the
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.840]  Second Amendment. It's then used, in fact it came out, they've used these cases and
[39:45.840 --> 39:49.320]  anti-gun stuff on TV.
[39:49.320 --> 39:53.400]  And as we learn more and more, it'll get even worse, of course, just like Fast and Furious.
[39:53.400 --> 39:57.980]  Which CBS News, with their credit, got the internal memos from higher ups saying, cover
[39:57.980 --> 40:03.320]  this up. We're gonna use this to go after the guns. Well, of course, I said that before
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.760]  it came out. Of course, they were already on the news when Obama got elected.
[40:08.760 --> 40:14.080]  They were already on the news in 2009 going, we've gotta turn our guns in. We've gotta
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.200]  ban semi-autos. They're being used in Mexico. We've got gun tracker programs. That's how
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.160]  we know the White House was lying because it turned out they had directed it. And before
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.960]  they got caught arming the cartels, they said, yeah, we're tracking the guns in this program.
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.000]  You bet you were tracking them. You were giving them the guns because the drug cartels are
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.860]  buying full auto and buying armored vehicles.
[40:37.860 --> 40:43.560]  And having Goldman Sachs-type mega banks launder the money. It's come out with all these big
[40:43.560 --> 40:48.440]  Federal Reserve-connected banks, mainly Wachovia and Wells Fargo, the ones that have been busted
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.480]  with the hundreds of billions of drug money. And specifically running the aircraft, the
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.160]  weapons, you name it to them. When's the last time you heard about a big Federal Reserve
[41:00.160 --> 41:01.160]  shareholding bank?
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.080]  Because all the big six banks own share in the Federal Reserve, the private offshore
[41:06.080 --> 41:13.160]  Federal Reserve. And just go in your LexisNexis if you're a reporter and type in Federal Reserve
[41:13.160 --> 41:18.520]  Bank, 6 billion in drug money, 20 billion in drug money. You'll see it all the time,
[41:18.520 --> 41:20.160]  but nobody gets in trouble.
[41:20.160 --> 41:26.640]  Instead, they'll raid some dilapidated drug house just a few times a year per city to
[41:26.640 --> 41:32.320]  make it look like they're doing something. Our government has been involved in the drug
[41:32.320 --> 41:44.240]  trade, taxing it since it was legal in 1789. Cocaine, opium, laudanum, then heroin after
[41:44.240 --> 41:51.040]  the 1860s when they invented purifying it. The derivative of opium, all of it, just shipping
[41:51.040 --> 41:53.800]  it in en masse on record.
[41:53.800 --> 41:59.360]  The CIA Solicitor General, 1997, look it up, congressional hearings admitted it. This is
[41:59.360 --> 42:08.360]  a public secret, a public secret. There's Forbes, is the Federal Reserve using money
[42:08.360 --> 42:12.320]  laundering techniques to cleanse banks balance sheets? I don't know, do bears go poo poo
[42:12.320 --> 42:13.320]  in the woods?
[42:13.320 --> 42:19.600]  I mean, is Charlie Manson a lunatic? Is Bill Clinton a liar? Does Superman have a red cape?
[42:19.600 --> 42:27.680]  Is the Easter Bunny a bunny? Do turtles have shells? Are Ewoks stupid and ruin Turn of
[42:27.680 --> 42:35.880]  the Jedi? My goodness, it's already time to go to break again. All right, we'll be back.
[42:35.880 --> 42:39.000]  I'm going to shut up. I'm going to get into the really big news after that.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.440]  US on alert for possible fireworks bombs. Nanny Cam, home invader, assaulted mother
[42:44.440 --> 42:49.760]  in front of her child, was known to have entered a neighbor's home, but no one did anything.
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.720]  He had four burglary convictions and just been let out of prison. Obama compares Nelson
[42:54.720 --> 43:01.360]  Mandela, a hardcore communist, to George Washington. It's all coming up.
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.800]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are

[46:02.580 --> 46:08.580]  of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm
[46:08.580 --> 46:13.840]  strikes, people panic. It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food
[46:13.840 --> 46:19.060]  price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the
[46:19.060 --> 46:23.420]  end of the summer. Wonder if there will really be a problem? eFoods Direct has a plan to

[47:16.020 --> 47:34.180]  the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. You know, in England,
[47:34.180 --> 47:41.580]  they are moving to ban without a license, having any type of sharp knives, even for
[47:41.580 --> 47:47.300]  chefs, because someone might do something bad with a knife. Why not ban cars? Someone
[47:47.300 --> 47:51.340]  might run people over with cars, look out. They're coming out with the new Mercedes and
[47:51.340 --> 47:56.700]  things where the car won't let you do stuff like that, supposedly. But then if an unnamed
[47:56.700 --> 48:01.980]  agency or individual wants to hack into your Mercedes and drive it off the road in a fireball,
[48:01.980 --> 48:08.780]  they can, can't they? By the way, I had the Rolling Stones editor's army buddy that he
[48:08.780 --> 48:14.020]  was embedded with off and on for years as one of his best friends on the show, and he
[48:14.020 --> 48:15.420]  thinks they probably killed him.
[48:15.420 --> 48:19.180]  He was at the funeral. The wife of Michael Hastings thinks they probably killed him,
[48:19.180 --> 48:23.340]  and she says, I'll bring down whoever did this. And they said that he was being death
[48:23.340 --> 48:26.900]  threaded by the army. They were gonna kill him. That was the biggest story ever. And
[48:26.900 --> 48:32.020]  he was going into hiding two hours before his car blew up, witnesses said, and then
[48:32.020 --> 48:34.660]  flew off the road into a tree.
[48:34.660 --> 48:41.700]  And that has been out in the news now for six days, breaking on my show, and no one
[48:41.700 --> 48:47.260]  that I've seen has covered it. I mean, even if we're crazy to question him being blown
[48:47.260 --> 48:51.460]  up, when the army's going, you're dead for what you've released, we're going to kill
[48:51.460 --> 48:52.460]  you.
[48:52.460 --> 48:56.700]  And it turns out it's not just hearsay on my show, he wrote that in one of his books.
[48:56.700 --> 49:00.860]  But he was getting death threats the day he died and said, I'm going into hiding, and
[49:00.860 --> 49:05.460]  then his car blows up. I'm getting death threats. I'm going into hiding. Biggest story ever.
[49:05.460 --> 49:09.780]  Imperial troops are in the base. Imperial troops are in the base. I mean, to continue
[49:09.780 --> 49:15.660]  the cheesy Star Wars analogies, I'm waiting for him to say at the 50th anniversary that
[49:15.660 --> 49:16.940]  Kennedy wasn't even assassinated.
[49:16.940 --> 49:22.040]  In fact, you're a conspiracy theorist if you say he was killed, period. A gnat did that
[49:22.040 --> 49:29.660]  to him. A gnat was a convertible. They were going too fast. We were in Texas, big gnats
[49:29.660 --> 49:34.220]  here, everything's bigger. Like the gnats in the cartoon with the big sharp nose, blew
[49:34.220 --> 49:39.820]  his head clean off. Blew the brains all over Jackie's pretty little dress.
[49:39.820 --> 49:45.660]  I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you that's what mainstream news says. I'm sticking to
[49:45.660 --> 49:53.220]  it. I'm not gonna question anything. Vince Foster, witnesses saw him dragging a dead
[49:53.220 --> 49:57.820]  body out there, and Hillary cleaned out his office, and all the witnesses, he was shot
[49:57.820 --> 50:02.940]  on the top of the head. Hey, a lot of people wrap themselves up in a carpet and take themselves
[50:02.940 --> 50:05.620]  and throw themselves in a park.
[50:05.620 --> 50:13.900]  I'm going with that. And I think Richard, Richard, is it Edward? I keep saying Richard
[50:13.900 --> 50:18.780]  Snowden, Edward Snowden. You know what, I'm teleprompter free, that's gonna happen. But
[50:18.780 --> 50:25.180]  let's get to the really big threat. Every time there's any event going on, Christmas,
[50:25.180 --> 50:32.540]  New Year's, Halloween, Fourth of July, we've got to hear the terrorists are planning to
[50:32.540 --> 50:33.540]  hit us.
[50:33.540 --> 50:37.420]  And the army's gonna be out of events all over the country. And the TSA is gonna be
[50:37.420 --> 50:43.900]  in cities all over the nation, randomly searching people on the roads and at the terminals now.
[50:43.900 --> 50:49.020]  And Bloomberg wants to ban fireworks in New York State, not because they can burn stuff
[50:49.020 --> 50:52.880]  down, but because you heard it, folks, the terrorists might get them and make a bomb
[50:52.880 --> 50:55.180]  out of them.
[50:55.180 --> 50:58.940]  Just like we got to ban knives, I mean, you can't be trusted. Now government can have
[50:58.940 --> 51:03.140]  nuclear weapons and missiles and tanks and armored vehicles and 2 billion bullets and
[51:03.140 --> 51:09.740]  be training to take on gun owners and tea partiers, but that's okay.
[51:09.740 --> 51:18.500]  US on alert for possible fireworks bombs, here's UPI security officials, they're not
[51:18.500 --> 51:23.500]  servants, they're officials, said US police should be on the alert. But for al-Qaeda,
[51:23.500 --> 51:28.220]  you gave 10,000 heat seeking missiles in Syria, you got all the neighbors freaked out, even
[51:28.220 --> 51:31.780]  the pro-west Jordanians are freaked out.
[51:31.780 --> 51:35.660]  They're like, why are you bringing al-Qaeda in by the, now it's over 100,000 they're saying
[51:35.660 --> 51:40.140]  into our area and giving them heat seeking missiles, while they dance around saying we're
[51:40.140 --> 51:46.560]  gonna blow up more buildings. We publish these videos and we post them on Infowars.com every
[51:46.560 --> 51:51.220]  day cutting people's heads off, cutting their hearts out, blowing up synagogues, blowing
[51:51.220 --> 51:56.780]  up churches, blowing up Shiite mosque that these Wahhabists don't like.
[51:56.780 --> 52:02.380]  Our government has brought over 100,000 at any one time, was 60, now it's over 100,000
[52:02.380 --> 52:12.100]  to attack Syria who did nothing and who's secular, a Ba'athist regime. But we gotta
[52:12.100 --> 52:17.740]  ban our fireworks, Jiminy Crickets, I mean, al-Qaeda is gonna blow us up.
[52:17.740 --> 52:22.700]  You're like, well, Alex, the Boston bombing, the Boston bombing, you got FBI agents being
[52:22.700 --> 52:28.140]  killed that were involved arresting the Patsy brother. You've got their other witness, them
[52:28.140 --> 52:32.320]  shooting him in the top of the head admitting he didn't even resist them now. You've got
[52:32.320 --> 52:37.260]  the older brother sent by the CIA to infiltrate al-Qaeda groups, that's been confirmed, he
[52:37.260 --> 52:38.500]  worked for the State Department.
[52:38.500 --> 52:44.220]  I mean, double agents bare minimum, they blew up what they probably thought were just a
[52:44.220 --> 52:48.180]  part of a drill. Turns out there was a drill, like I told you. No wonder they're on national
[52:48.180 --> 52:56.860]  TV saying, do not look at Infowars.com, remember that at the press conferences?
[52:56.860 --> 53:01.500]  It goes on and on and on and on, the United States has been hijacked by foreign banks
[53:01.500 --> 53:07.220]  that run al-Qaeda. It's criminal elements inside the government, steering and piloting
[53:07.220 --> 53:12.900]  it. It's like these science fiction movies where the slug climbs in your ear, Rafa Khan
[53:12.900 --> 53:20.780]  or Host, and then controls you, maybe people can get an analogy or an allegory.
[53:20.780 --> 53:25.860]  It's not our government, it's criminal interest. They're always talking about national security.
[53:25.860 --> 53:29.360]  National security means they can commit all their crimes. National security means they
[53:29.360 --> 53:33.900]  can shut down coal plants here and move them to China with no environmental standards to
[53:33.900 --> 53:39.500]  build widgets cheaper than we can. National security means they can get away with unlimited
[53:39.500 --> 53:42.540]  crimes against our republic.
[53:42.540 --> 53:52.880]  A bunch of foreign companies and a whole bunch of foreign countries have access to your emails,
[53:52.880 --> 53:59.580]  your text, your phone calls. They're all sharing this data. Europe, the UK, the United States,
[53:59.580 --> 54:03.980]  Australia, New Zealand, the Anglo-American Global Empire. And it's called that because
[54:03.980 --> 54:11.760]  of the Anglo-American combines, not meaning white people. It means the robber baron index
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.980]  of the British East India, Dutch East India Company model of a corporate empire above
[54:16.980 --> 54:20.040]  the law, exempt from taxes, and we aren't.
[54:20.040 --> 54:25.340]  We're not part of the club. So many good old boys, black, white, Hispanic, I don't care,
[54:25.340 --> 54:31.160]  go USA, USA, no matter what the crimes are of this government, bipartisan. Because they
[54:31.160 --> 54:35.960]  feel like when they're carpet bombing some villagers in Africa or the Middle East or
[54:35.960 --> 54:38.980]  Asia that that's our manliness and you're part of it.
[54:38.980 --> 54:44.820]  You pay for it, you don't get the spoils. Our gas prices went up after the Iraq War.
[54:44.820 --> 54:49.260]  It was done because Saddam was selling too much oil and driving down the prices. Go look
[54:49.260 --> 54:58.280]  up the first Gulf War. OPEC was pulling, the Saudis were beside themselves over him driving
[54:58.280 --> 55:00.560]  down the price of oil to pay off his debts.
[55:00.560 --> 55:09.580]  From the Iran-Iraq War that he went $35 billion to the US in to get the nerve gas. The CIA
[55:09.580 --> 55:14.000]  and US satellites were running that war against Iran. The US told him, yeah, go ahead and
[55:14.000 --> 55:24.300]  invade Kuwait to pay us off. They set him up, April Gillespie, the US ambassador. Then
[55:24.300 --> 55:33.180]  they went on TV and called him Sodom Hussein, which means, you know what sodomy means?
[55:33.180 --> 55:39.940]  That's an Arabic word, Sodom. They went on there so there was no way he could back off.
[55:39.940 --> 55:48.220]  He was a US-CIA full bore, trained in Egypt, US government agent. Sodom Hussein on record
[55:48.220 --> 55:55.420]  was put in power in 1979 by the US government. He was trained as an army captain in the late
[55:55.420 --> 56:00.300]  1950s. Look it up. And I'm not a fan of Sodom Hussein, but they tell him to attack Iran,
[56:00.300 --> 56:01.300]  he does it.
[56:01.300 --> 56:04.580]  They tell him invade Kuwait to get the money to pay him back, he does it. They set him
[56:04.580 --> 56:12.220]  up. This is disgusting to put a bunch of radicals in the Middle East. They're removing secular
[56:12.220 --> 56:17.260]  leaders like him. I don't care how many HBO shows you show where he's a bad guy. It's
[56:17.260 --> 56:21.060]  so childlike. They go, here's the villain and we're supposed to go, there's the villain.
[56:21.060 --> 56:25.740]  Here, let's look at some more articles here. The slugs, the globalist slugs that are above
[56:25.740 --> 56:32.460]  the law that climb in our country's collective brains and then run us like automatons.
[56:32.460 --> 56:38.420]  And you're like, USA, USA. USA is a foreign banking combine that wants to enslave you
[56:38.420 --> 56:45.260]  and is deindustrializing America. Let me show you this. Obama compares Nelson Mandela to
[56:45.260 --> 56:50.840]  George Washington. I have never seen something that disgusting, ladies and gentlemen. Nelson
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.320]  Mandela, they tagged on to the anti-apartheid movement, which I think was good. He was a
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.700]  hardcore communist mass bomber. His wife says her favorite thing to do is hang tires over
[57:00.700 --> 57:04.740]  children's heads and necklace them. I mean, he's just a horrible person. He's certainly
[57:04.740 --> 57:11.440]  not George Washington. Look at this. NFL declines to promote Obamacare. That's some good news.
[57:11.440 --> 57:17.820]  Can Wi-Fi let you see through people's walls? CNET News, that's CBS. And then it goes on
[57:17.820 --> 57:22.860]  to tell you what I already told you. But they don't tell you the Xbox, that's how it looks
[57:22.860 --> 57:28.880]  through your walls, the new Xbox, connect. The Microsoft has cameras, microphones, face
[57:28.880 --> 57:34.780]  scanning technology and wireless. They had ground penetrating radar 30 years ago. That's
[57:34.780 --> 57:39.220]  all this is. They have better sensors now. These Google blimps they're launching have
[57:39.220 --> 57:43.780]  this and they look right through your walls, black and white image of you in bed with your
[57:43.780 --> 57:50.580]  wife on the toilet. You name it, baby, you name it. Second hour coming up.

[59:56.380 --> 01:00:06.100]  Jones Broadcasting Network. From his Central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines,
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:21.480]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Alright, coming
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.540]  up in the next segment, I'm gonna give the phone number out for your specific questions
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]  for Wayne Madsen.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.200]  He joins us at about 20 after today for the balance of the broadcast. So I'll give the
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:40.100]  number out for your specific NSA questions from a real NSA whistleblower. And this has
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:45.580]  got the system so upset, as I said earlier, they have taken down the London Guardian slash
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.960]  London Observer article, it's twin newspapers, and even expunged the Google cache. And they
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.180]  haven't done a retraction saying we removed the article because it was wrong. They've
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.340]  been de-noticed, which is over in England, the government can tell them to take something
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.460]  down, they have to do it.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:08.840]  But as it broke in the US papers on Thursday and Friday, our government, the Leech Globalist,
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.720]  are ordering the headquarters of the Leech Globalist, London, to remove this stuff. Or
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.100]  probably London ordered its minions in the US to then make the request so it wasn't too
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:23.620]  obvious who's running things. No attack on the British people, by the way, you just were
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.300]  a prominent, powerful island.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:30.660]  So the globalist moved in and took over your country and it made you the system to take
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:37.380]  over the rest of the planet. And I for one just wanna reverse this, I wanna stop this.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:42.900]  By the way, Kurt Nemo wrote an article about Nelson Mandela, Obama and Nelson Mandela,
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:48.580]  George Washington, a communist, that's up on infoawars.com. And then we've got some
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:54.500]  other very important articles that we're gonna be getting to as well, Jordanian suspicious
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.460]  about US military deployment.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:02.860]  And it said they had a drill there and then now the US hasn't left. The drill started
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.760]  about a month ago but was supposed to end June 20th. And the US military says they're
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.300]  staying cuz it's not the US military, it's the globalist military. Very, very spooky,
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:20.740]  very, very weird. But getting back to this just briefly, can Wi-Fi let you see through
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.740]  people's walls?
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, they keep having articles every week going, researchers at a university
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:32.420]  were able to use the Kinect system or were able to use other Wi-Fi systems to see through
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:38.420]  walls and even face scan people. While they say it's incredible that the Wi-Fi can do
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.660]  it, they say, man, this is really high tech.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.180]  This previously what was on this Kinect, what was on these other systems was the most expensive
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:53.220]  Pentagon systems. It's incredible that this is so overly muscular on these systems. It
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:03:02.380]  is so powerful just for a little video game. Hey, this looks for your walls, you look through
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:08.540]  your walls, look through your walls.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:15.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what they do. And they're showing the public very low power
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:22.020]  examples of how this is able to do it. And you can go to infoawards.com and read all
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.660]  about that. But the point is, is that this is just more of a high tech version of ground
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.660]  penetrating radar.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.700]  Speaking of that, RT reports FBI suit over secretive facial recognition program. Turns
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:38.240]  out they're scooping up digital photos from Facebook, driver's license databases, you
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.820]  name it. And I would also add Facebook makes people confirm it's their Facebook by confirming,
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.060]  hey, this is your photo, right?
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:50.820]  And hey, this is your high school buddy, blah, blah, blah. And now when you go on Facebook,
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:58.140]  it'll tell you when you upload a picture, they'll say, hey, these people with you are
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:05.700]  these people, right? Confirm for security. So the computer is now training you as a slave
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:15.620]  to respond to it and confirm as a human computer interface with human intelligence that that
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.060]  is indeed the person.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.180]  And then they have TV shows about how cool it is and news shows. And then in New York
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:26.700]  and LA and Tokyo and Moscow and London, in the fanciest areas, they have deals where
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:33.820]  you walk by and the Facebook cameras shout out at you, Alex Jones, it's you. Wait, turn
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.500]  around, just like in Minority Report that came out 10 years ago, they already had it
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.500]  then.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.260]  They're getting you ready for it. Hey, did you know you can get specials on this at a
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:51.060]  store just down the street? We know you like polo. Literally, that's right, four years
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:57.200]  ago. This is the AI grid, but it's all done happy. If they painted army tanks pink, mothers
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.580]  would lay their babies down to have them run over by it.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:04.300]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.340]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The highest rates of diabetes,
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:16.500]  autism and every other major disease. It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:22.180]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.980]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.860]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:39.320]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit Infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and

[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:09.540]  Defending the republic from enemies born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:43.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 30th day of June 2013. Can you believe we're already
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:51.740]  more than halfway through 2013? Just a light speed. I come in all the time that started
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:57.860]  the broadcast and almost announced 2008 or 2010. It's just the years just blip by. We
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:05.020]  got Wayne Madsen, NSA insider and whistleblower, who had the US government block stories he
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.740]  was interviewed in and the London Guardian and Observer. And there's no coverage of this.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:15.580]  This is a big story for whoever reports on it. Business Insider reported on it. We link
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:21.020]  to it on Infowars.com. But we have the rest of the story coming up in the next segment.
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:27.260]  But first, let me shift gears into an article we put out Friday that was linked up on the
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:37.520]  vaunted almighty driver of news coverage, DrudgeReport.com via Infowars.com. Ex-Chicago
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:43.660]  cop Zimmerman acquittal to cause race riots. A former cop and detective, he's an award
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.100]  winning writer for major publications.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:50.580]  You can read the whole story. Said that according to the thousands of tweets he's seeing and
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:55.700]  what he's seen happen in the past with the Rodney King verdict and things like that,
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:08:02.220]  if George Zimmerman is acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin, a former Chicago police officer
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:09.100]  warns that the outcome of the case could spark race riots in cities all over America.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:15.680]  And then we break down the entire situation in the article up on Infowars.com that I think
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.540]  is in the top five most viral stories we ever put out. On Friday, you can go to Google,
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.000]  but you can also go to other trackers. We had two stories in the top five. Our story
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.300]  about police strapping people down to forcibly take blood and they like take big bags of
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.560]  blood now.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.240]  Just incredible. Didn't used to happen in America, happens now. Imagine in North Korea
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.320]  that was happening. We'd think it was horrible, but not here. We'll shoot some fireworks off.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:45.360]  That was the fifth biggest story on the web Friday. And the third biggest story was our
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.660]  George Zimmerman story about this. It's just amazing to just routinely be able to do that.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.620]  That's why Infowars.com is so precious, is that we can get up here and get people to
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:01.780]  think for themselves. And even take mainstream news articles, but point out another angle
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.820]  to it that really resonates with the people.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.900]  But here's the article. You can read it up on Infowars.com. It's in the most read section
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:13.220]  on the right hand column. Just scroll down about halfway and there it is. Ex Chicago
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:20.860]  cops Zimmerman acquittal to cause race riots. And I saw video, last week we talked about
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:28.500]  it, of a nanny cam in New Jersey of this guy beating a woman, a black guy, beating a white
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500]  woman.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:35.380]  It looked like for, I don't know, two or three minutes thrown her downstairs right in front
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:40.100]  of a three year old child. The woman didn't even resist him. It turns out that they have
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.700]  arrested a man who they think did. He looks just like him. When they arrested him, he
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.500]  was wearing a black and white striped old fashioned prison style shirt. I guess he was
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:55.380]  already. He's been convicted of robbery four times and had just gotten out a month before
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:00.300]  from a short stint for a aggravated home invasion.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.480]  Nanny cam home invader who assaulted mother in front of her child was known to have entered
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.740]  a neighbor's home. Sean Curtis had recently been released from jail for burglary. If he
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:16.420]  was to break into my house, black or white, he'd be deader than a bucket of coffin nails.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.900]  I can tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, because we don't call 911 except for them
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.380]  to come scoop up the body.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.220]  Come in my office too, you're going to be going out feet first as well if you come in
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.220]  here with a weapon or trying to rob somebody. And you look at the crime rates where they've
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:36.900]  taken almost all the guns in New Jersey, in areas of Illinois like Chicago. I mean, the
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.820]  crime rate, I've shown the Justice Department numbers, it's five, 10, 15, depending on the
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:47.680]  area times higher than anywhere else in the US. And it's just so pathetic to see a big
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.280]  man beat up a woman.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.820]  And I wanna know this, if he isn't convicted, will there be race riots around America? I
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:59.900]  don't think there should be. But the issue is that now there's all these witnesses that
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.040]  George Zimmerman walked up and asked the guy what he was doing. Maybe that wasn't a good
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:11.620]  idea, but it didn't give Mr. Martin the right to break the guy's nose and bounce his head
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.260]  off the seamen over and over again.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.980]  And that's what all the witnesses saw. And I'm sad that Trayvon Martin's dead, but the
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.900]  Justice Department went down there, quietly behind the scenes, this came out, to stir
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:28.480]  it up. They want racial division, just look at MSNBC, it is abhorrent. They wanna change
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.340]  the subject from deindustrialization and carbon taxes and corruption and all these
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:39.020]  mega corporations that put Obama in office being totally tax exempt and more banker bailouts
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.320]  and the looting of the country, on and on and on.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:47.820]  They wanna make it all about Obama being part African. I wouldn't care if he was blue, green,
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:53.980]  pink, purple, if he was into liberty, but he is a horrible, corrupt globalist. And they
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:12:01.380]  are selling racial division in this country. And that's why there are black on white gangs
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.780]  attacking people all over the country.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:09.100]  And you'll see newspapers apologize now when they report it, or they won't say when it's
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.460]  racially motivated, unless it's white people. And this is done to, again, create racial
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:22.020]  division. Well, it's like Alec Baldwin, he's come out and used a bunch of homophobic words,
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.460]  calling gay people horrible names in tweets, I'm not gonna repeat it.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:30.180]  And he said take Republicans out, go to their house, kill them, kill their children, burn
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.740]  down their houses, kill their families. He's above the law. So the London Guardian said
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.700]  Hollywood's refusal to stand up to Alec Baldwin is shameful. Alec Baldwin uses homophobic
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:43.560]  slurs against gay, Daily Mail journalists, and nobody says anything.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:49.880]  Because political correctness is only meant to be used against libertarians or conservatives.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.100]  It's only meant to stifle everybody's speech, but the establishment people. Okay, that's
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:02.400]  what's going on with Alec Baldwin. Alec Baldwin, you have been very useful to me to quote the
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.740]  great Kim Jong Il in Team America.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:09.720]  All right, continuing here, let's get into George Zimmerman trial. Neighbor testified
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:17.340]  Trayvon Martin was straddling Zimmerman moments before fatal gunshot. Yeah, no kidding. And
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:25.580]  then other neighbors said they heard, please help me, get off me, help me. And it just
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.860]  goes on from there.
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:31.760]  Now we have this article, illiterate rambling defense witness Rachel Gentell is a victim
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:37.320]  of brain damaging mass fluoridation. And maybe Miss Teen USA is too, only one we found dumber
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.900]  than this lady. And let's go to some of the clips where, well, let's just go to this first
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:51.640]  clip where on the stand, the so-called star witness Rachel Gentell says creepy ass cracker,
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640]  not a racial slur.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]  Let's play that.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.240]  Describing the person is what made you think it was racial?
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]  Yes.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:02.240]  And that's because he described him as a creepy ass cracker?
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.980]  Yes.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:11.680]  So it was racial, but it was because Trayvon Martin put race in this.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.680]  No.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680]  No.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:20.880]  All right, let's get her off there. Let's go to the next clip with this genius. Rachel
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:28.640]  Gentell can't read her own letter somebody wrote for. So she can't read her own letter.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.080]  Miss Gentell, would you take a look at that copy of the letter and let me ask you a couple
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:43.640]  of questions about it. Do you recognize that letter as being one that you said earlier
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.880]  was prepared to be given to Miss Fulton?
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.540]  Yes.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:57.040]  And that letter was prepared with the assistance of a friend of yours named Francine Serv.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.120]  Yes.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:06.400]  And you and Miss Serv talked about what you wanted to be in the letter, and then she helped
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.800]  write it in a way that was legible, correct?
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]  Yes.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.040]  But the contents of the letter are yours.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.440]  Yes.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:24.080]  Are you able to read that copy well enough that you can tell us if it's in fact the same
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.080]  letter?
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080]  No.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.360]  That's enough.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.400]  Are you unable to read that at all?
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.040]  When I come back, we're going to weigh Madsen. But first I'm going to play the victim of
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:41.240]  the TV dumbed down culture, big government, Caitlin Upton, not to be confused with the
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:46.800]  intelligent and lovely Kate Upton, who I've seen do interviews. We're going to play a
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:56.720]  soul sister of this lady, the dumb blonde Caitlin Upton with her famous Teen USA speech.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.600]  Now, now these women are up there promoting the NSA.

[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:17.620]  dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from

[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:09.520]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:28.320]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:37.960]  We're going to go to censored NSA whistleblower Wayne Madsen. This is a big story. The balance
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.440]  of the hour in just a moment and I will give the number out so in the last segment you
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:48.520]  can have questions for him about the NSA. Now again, I've been having him on and been
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:54.680]  saying folks I wouldn't be surprised if they try to shut this down because he knows a lot
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.720]  more than even people like Snowden and he's not been even giving out secrets. He's too
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.160]  smart for that. He's been giving out what's been already leaked and pointing out what
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.480]  he can legally point out. That's why they've had a major interview he did for the London
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:14.040]  Guardian slash Observer, the biggest paper in England, the biggest English speaking paper
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.080]  in Europe shut down.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:21.080]  Not for inaccuracy, it's disappeared and it's starting to break here in the US. You're getting
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:26.880]  an exclusive with Wayne Madsen. But first showing the dumbing down, I just played clips
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:36.160]  of the Rachel Jontel, not even really knowing what planet she's on. And so many people are
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.000]  like this. And here's Caitlin Upton, the Miss Teen USA pageant a few years ago that's
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.140]  so famous, not knowing what planet she's on.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:50.400]  So no wonder the tyrants are going crazy because of things like this. Here it is.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.960]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the US on a world map. Why do
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.000]  you think this is?
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:08.240]  I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so. Because some people out there
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.440]  in our nation don't have that. And I believe that our education like such as in South Africa
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:22.880]  and the Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe that they should, our education over
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:29.040]  here in the US should help the US or should help South Africa and should help the Iraq
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:35.420]  and the Asian countries to be able to build up our future.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:41.740]  Now Mary McCord just a few weeks ago at the Miss USA pageant, she's Miss Alabama. She
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:48.840]  had this to say about the NSA, so they are definitely training them well. Here it is.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.760]  To Wendy Ballack, your question please for Alabama.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.900]  Government tracking and phone records has been in the news lately. Is this an invasion
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:05.200]  of privacy or necessary to keep our country safe? Why or why not?
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.360]  I think the society that we live in today, it's sad that if we go to the movies or to
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.120]  the airport or even to the mall that we have to worry about our safety. So I would rather
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:18.320]  someone track my telephone messages and feel safe wherever I go.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:30.600]  I think I'm also going to date the Hell's Angels.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:36.920]  This is why our country is in so much trouble. And the idea that a government that can listen
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.040]  to your phone calls isn't going to do something bad with that. You're always going to get
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.440]  criminal elements and when you let them do unconstitutional things, bad things happen.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.400]  That's why we've always known the bad countries listen to your phone calls. The bad countries
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:56.440]  like Guatemala and North Korea reads your mail. The bad countries have police wearing
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.200]  black ski mask. Mexico had that 60 years ago.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:06.860]  Areas of Eastern Europe had that 50 years ago, 60 years ago. They're called secret police.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:14.600]  But everything bad countries do, we now have and as long as we chant USA, USA, USA, USA
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.160]  over the top of it. USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.520]  Ship part jobs to China, pay $21 million to ship General Motors to China with taxpayer
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.680]  money. Yeah. I'm telling you, folks, if you had army tanks that were pink and said it
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.160]  was for Obama, liberals would bring their kids out and run tanks over them.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.220]  I'm telling you, you could have cyanide pills and mark them with like little puppy dogs
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:42.240]  on the tablets and say it's trending and they'd eat them. I'm not joking. I just want to be
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:52.680]  listen to us, I'm safe, I'm safer, USA, America, and we're good.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.880]  It is so pathetic, ladies and gentlemen. Now for the balance of the hour, he joins us graciously.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.520]  He's gonna be back home with Mike Adams, he's filling in tomorrow, but then I'm back Tuesday.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.120]  Promise my children I'm taking them fishing and taking them wakeboarding. So it's going
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.000]  to happen, didn't happen a few weeks ago, it's happening tomorrow. I'm taking off tomorrow.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.500]  The great Mike Adams is gonna be here and he'll be back with Wayne tomorrow in a more
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.760]  in-depth discussion. Hopefully, this will be in the press by then. But I noticed on
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.040]  an article at infoawards.com today, that you can see right now, we can put it on screen
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.120]  and show TV viewers, but radio listeners just go there.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:31.260]  We're about to go to break, Wayne, I just wanna introduce this. That there was a London
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:36.360]  Guardian Observer, that's the Twin Papers, big article about the EU working with the
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.600]  US to spy illegally. Well, that came out in the EU Commission a decade ago, that came
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.840]  out in James Bamford's book 12 years ago.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:48.840]  The guy that ran Nightline, had a best selling book, ABC News was behind it. So, Wayne Madsen
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.240]  talked about that, he worked at the NSA, he's testified before Congress on this and other
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.480]  matters. He's written for the biggest publications in the US, we've been having him on, nobody
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.760]  else has. So, the Guardian, who's been really on this, interviews him.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.200]  D notices that were already in the press last week that they'd been sent out to shut down
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.200]  stuff in the Guardian. We now learn it's Wayne Madsen. Now, do you think that should be news
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:18.080]  that a US former NSA guy, journalist, award winning, got shut down? Do you think that
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.600]  should be news? No, it's not news, it disappeared and the Google cache.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.800]  I saw the Google cache this morning, read it, had our guys post the Google cache on
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.240]  our site. Show the articles, they're still saved. Well, they shut down infoawards.com.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.640]  I've never seen the Google cache shut down like this. And again, they didn't retract
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.880]  something. They just removed it, but then started disinfo campaigns on the web against
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:48.120]  Wayne Madsen. They are scared. Why? Because he's doing it right. He is blowing the whistle
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:52.520]  on what's hidden in plain view. He has credibility, so now they wanna assassinate his character.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.960]  We'll get more into that. But Wayne, bottom line, you talked to the Guardian slash Observer,
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.920]  they admitted they were leaned on.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:08.160]  Well, I talked to the Observer and they had vetted this through their legal counsel. I
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:18.120]  assume all their editors signed off on it. They got everybody's chop and right as the
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.200]  Observer, actually the print edition, the first edition already ran and was sent out
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:28.280]  to the news agents. The second edition, the story disappeared from the front page of the
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280]  paper edition.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:36.040]  And of course, first, if you went to the Guardian site, it said the link is down because of
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:43.040]  an investigation, whatever that means. And then now it says the link is broken. So for
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.080]  all purposes, the story was removed.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.200]  And then they disappeared it off the Google Wayback Machine, unprecedented.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:57.680]  Yeah, I mean, when I put the word out to some of my friends and colleagues, I said something's
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  going on.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:06.960]  A lot of them grabbed it and saved it because this is rather unusual, even for some seasoned
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.360]  journalists that I spoke to.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.760]  Now, for those that don't know, we're gonna come back and give you the floor as best I
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.860]  can. This is such a big deal. It's hard to not add points. The big enchilada here from
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:19.800]  my perspective, we'll get your take on this when we come back, is that you don't wanna
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.800]  go to prison.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.840]  Cuz you were a pretty high level guy at the NSA. You work up on Capitol Hill, anybody
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.320]  can watch C-SPAN and see a national security hearings. You'll see you there reporting at
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.800]  the National Press Club. You're a smart guy. You're going off what's already been admitted
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:41.440]  before in EU commissions, which I noticed articles saying the EU's mad at the US over
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440]  spying.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.760]  They're, of course, running and all, basically. That's what you expose. That's why they're
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:53.400]  upset. So this is admitted, already declassified info being censored now and a journalist being
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.720]  censored. This is a big deal, folks, for freedom of the press. We'll be back with Wayne Madsen
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.720]  of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:06.280]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.960]  us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic. It would be wise to
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:17.540]  prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:21.860]  is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer. Wonder if there'll really
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:27.520]  be a problem? eFoodsDirect has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad

[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:05.080]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:10.120]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The highest rates of diabetes,
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:17.280]  autism and every other major disease. It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.960]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:28.760]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.640]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:11.020]  great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of dollars have been
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:18.720]  spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:24.520]  education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage

[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.920]  We're going to take a few calls for Wayne Madsen at the next segment specifically on
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:46.840]  the NSA. I want to see what angles you bring us to, kind of a wild card. Callers always
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:52.040]  ask good questions or tend to. A toll free number to join us specifically on the NSA.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:34:01.160]  Thanks for Wayne Madsen. Very, very quick questions. 877-789, Alex 877-789-2539 on this
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:07.400]  live Sunday worldwide broadcast, 877-789-2539. Also want to ask him about Michael Hastings
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:11.280]  and what happened there. The family does think that he was killed. I've confirmed that. Talk
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:18.160]  to him. Talk to his best buddy in the Army and Sergeant Biggs. We're going to get to
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:25.480]  all that. But Wayne, you heard what I said before the break. For me, this is a huge deal
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.380]  that you are a member of the press. You've written for the biggest newspapers and magazines
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.520]  in the country.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:35.200]  People can go look up your bio. You've testified to Congress main committees many times. You
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.760]  were in the NSA in the Naval War College before that. You were in NSA security. That's how
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:45.260]  you know about the Q group. What do you think it is that got this censored? Because I guess
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:51.640]  you have broken the Q group. You called it a kind of an internal Praetorian SS to persecute
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.640]  whistleblowers.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.480]  I mean, is that something? Because the rest of the stuff you brought out, and I want you
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:02.160]  to go over the EU Commission News, Bamford's book. I mean, this stuff has been out. I know
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.560]  that's where my sources are. That's how I knew all this. Guests like you, I mean, you're
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.760]  going about this smart from other people I've talked to that are former government.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.800]  You're talking about what is already out there but not really known. Is that why they did
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:20.640]  this D notice unprecedented to shut down what you were saying?
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.720]  I think that may be part of it also. I think they just can't handle all the leaks. There's
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:32.760]  another set of leaks in The Guardian today from Snowden about how they were bugging embassies.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:39.260]  And if he had access to that, this kind of proves the point I was making earlier. I believe
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:47.360]  Snowden was probably working for the Special Collections Service, which is a hybrid CIA-FBI
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.480]  operation that does exactly that. They put bugs in embassies in Washington, elsewhere,
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.920]  New York, overseas, and now he's released a bunch of that type of information.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:05.040]  But basically, what I experienced yesterday when this story came out is a little bit like
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:11.520]  what Glenn Greenwald has been facing. All of a sudden, there was this sort of attack
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:18.680]  pack on the internet. People were contacting all these websites, flooding Twitter with
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:26.520]  all these tweets, talking about previous stories I had written. And if that was the intention
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.520]  to shoot the messenger, I think it backfired on him. There were a lot of references to
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:37.400]  the stories I did in Chicago about Obama's sexual orientation.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:44.200]  And where is he right now? He's in South Africa. He's had a very tough time of it on his African
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:51.840]  trip trying to convince certain African countries to provide more in the way of rights for gays
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.560]  when, in fact, Africa's going the opposite direction. It's not a popular cause in Africa.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.680]  So he's got egg all over his face now.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.000]  Well, I gotta say this. When they rolled out Too Little Kids at the gay lesbian event,
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  I don't even get into this issue, and I know you're not anti-gay or anything. But I mean,
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.720]  they rolled out Little Kids at the gay lesbian event to introduce it, and they're talking
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.600]  about kids' cartoons.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:18.440]  I mean, if heterosexuals were involving kids on TV and cartoons' sexualization, it'd be
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.880]  called really creepy. If Calvin Klein has teenagers half naked, it's called creepy.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:28.200]  What's this thing with kids? And I gotta say, at that gay lesbian event, he was prancing
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.720]  around on the stage. And whatever, the point is that's blackmail material. That's why we're
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.900]  concerned about it, not about his sexual preference. Tell people your intel on that. You did this
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:42.560]  investigation into Obama and Larry Sinclair and stuff.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:48.960]  Yeah, I mean, I did not believe Larry Sinclair at first, and I wrote that. And he told me
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:55.520]  he said I was pretty tough on him. But when I went to Chicago, I started hearing the same
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:01.240]  stories. So I looked into it a lot further. Now, here's the thing that is amazing. When
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:08.520]  Michael Lissikoff got the story on Monica Lewinsky and the blue dress and all that business,
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:13.680]  that was mainstream media all over that story. When it's Obama, no, it's relegated to the
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:21.920]  offbeat sites, the non-mainstream media sites. But what has happened here by these attack
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.480]  dogs coming after me because of other stories I had written, which have nothing to do with
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.920]  the NSA story, by the way.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:37.400]  Now the bit about Obama's history in Chicago and people saying he's gay is in some of the
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:43.880]  biggest newspapers in Europe. That would have not happened had they not gone down the avenue
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.880]  they did because-
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.840]  And they have these NSA defense people, War College people and stuff have come out against
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.320]  you. They're really concerned about this.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:58.400]  Oh, yeah. I mean, one of the central figures is a professor at the Naval War College where
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.880]  I had done some postgraduate work in a continuing education course. I've got the certificate
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:08.240]  and I think it's kind of unusual that, you know, you'd have somebody on the U.S. government
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:14.720]  payroll using his affiliation with the War College attacking me like he's on duty. It
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.480]  was almost like this guy's on duty because it went all afternoon, all evening, all into
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.440]  the wee hours of the morning.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:27.560]  Look, we know from Cass Sunstein and what the NSA is doing through cyber command that
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.240]  they have these sock puppets out there to destroy the message, money the waters.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:37.280]  Oh, no, they admit cyber command has hired hundreds of private companies, PR companies
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.440]  to attack people that came out on the National Guard and Katrina putting whole teams for
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.560]  two years on one woman from the state who criticized the work they'd done. I mean, we
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.440]  know what's going on, but expanding on this, I mean, when you're always not making a big
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:55.420]  deal about yourself, you broke some major news that was hiding in plain view about the
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:40:03.200]  EU and what info poll nine and then the G.S., whatever it is, was a G.S. five there with
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.440]  the British spy network.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:09.920]  Break down this because they're in the news going, how dare America spy on us when they're
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.240]  all involved in the same system. So so break down what was in the piece that they're so
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.640]  scared of.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:21.880]  Well, what was in the piece was basically we know that Ed Snowden has talked about third
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:28.560]  party relationships of NSA and also the second party. There's a recent revelation in Spiegel.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.880]  There's Spiegel yesterday where he's talking about third parties. He cites Germany as being
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:40.580]  one of the countries. This was being lost because this was being looked into by the
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:47.840]  European Union and other governments in 1999, 2000. A report was issued. 9-11 comes along
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.800]  and all of this is forgotten. You know, it just goes down the memory hole. I actually
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:59.560]  testified before the EU parliamentary commission. They came to Washington, D.C. and I told them,
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:05.720]  you know, what I knew about the echelon and the system by which they shared information
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:11.800]  and that wound up in a report. But here's what came out of the Snowden revelations that
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:20.640]  GCHQ, which is Britain's NSA equivalent and partner, they and NSA were jointly tapping
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:29.480]  the transatlantic cable in Cornwall. And it comes from Denmark down to Germany and the
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.960]  Netherlands, Belgium and France. And then it hops over the English Channel, goes over
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:38.360]  to Cornwall and then it heads over to Tuckerton, New Jersey. They were sucking everything off
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:45.080]  this cable, email, phone calls, you name it, the metadata stuff, a system called at Cornwall
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:54.040]  Tempura. And then the Germans, Angela Merkel and the French started to get on their high
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:42:00.760]  horse. Here's Britain once again acting as America's Trojan horse when in fact I pointed
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:07.700]  out that Germany as a third party country to the NSA or SIGINT relationship, only the
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:12.160]  English speaking countries are second party. So the third parties are NATO allies that
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:18.240]  don't speak English. Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Japan and South
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:24.920]  Korea and Asia. I pointed out that for years the Germans and the Spanish jointly tapped
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:34.240]  the trans Mediterranean, transatlantic cable in southern Spain and Conil de la Frontera.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.060]  And then they pull it all together. Yeah, so they all tap different things and then
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:44.240]  pull it all. That came out when you testified before the EU. That came out in Bamford's
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.820]  book. He was the main news guy at Nightline. This is a fact. You put it back out there
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:54.900]  and your article disappears. Incredible, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be right back with Wayne

[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:08.000]  We're not just here Sunday's 4 to 6. So bottom line what you're saying is, hey, the Europe
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.520]  and others act all holier than thou. They're all putting in the same systems. They're all
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:17.360]  pooling it. They're all sharing it. In fact, I've read, I've had Bamford on for maybe seen
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.520]  news that he broke that they'll spy. Of course you were there. They'll spy. They'll have
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.760]  the Brits spy on the Americans and the Americans spy on the Brits vice versa because it's so
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:27.760]  illegal.
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.880]  It creates more plausible deniability in that way. You're not listening to your own cousin.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:36.200]  Is that accurate? Yeah, not only the Brits do it for the Americans and vice versa, but
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.400]  the Canadians do it for the Americans and the Brits and vice versa. The Australians
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:45.000]  do it for the Americans and the Brits. So foreigners are listening to our phones, not
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.800]  just our criminal government. So there's the big bombshell. In total, what do you make
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:55.360]  of this whole NSA thing and where it's going?
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:00.360]  Well, we don't know how much more Snowden has. Apparently he's turned over the bulk
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:06.600]  of his documents and most of them look like they're briefing slides and point papers,
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:10.440]  wait papers. He's turned this over at least to the Guardian. I don't know how much he's
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:16.240]  given to the Washington Post, but certainly they're not as open in releasing this stuff
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.000]  as the Guardian has been.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.640]  But he was high level then. This is like owner's manual stuff.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.520]  Yeah, he was kind of like a system administrator, security administrator. So he had access to
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:33.240]  a lot of stuff. And the Guardian, of course, is stringing it out and making a release sort
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:40.200]  of like what WikiLeaks did with their State Department cables. But now we've got the story
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:46.520]  about the bugging of the embassies, the missions in Washington, New York and in Europe. And
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.880]  it's interesting. The Italians, the EU itself, their missions in New York and Washington
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:59.200]  were bugged. The Italians, the French and the Greeks. But the Germans and the Dutch
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.400]  and the Danes, who were also the third party allies of NSA, were not. So I think we're
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:11.640]  looking at basically the northern European countries that are not having austerity problems
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:17.440]  like they are in southern Europe, are the ones doing the spying or-
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  Getting spot on.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.440]  Or not getting spot on.
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:23.040]  But bottom line, this is big news because it shows for all these countries, it's their
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.320]  own scandals. What do you make? I want to play this clip and get your take on it from
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:34.080]  Meet the Press last week with David Gregory sounding like some type of authoritarian muppet
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.820]  from a dystopic nightmare. Here it is.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:42.360]  To the extent that you have aided and abetted Snowden, even in his current movements, why
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:46.480]  shouldn't you, Mr. Greenwald, be charged with a crime? You're aiding and abetting the New
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:50.320]  World Order, Gregory.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.360]  I think it's pretty extraordinary that anybody who would call themselves a journalist would
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:51:00.000]  publicly muse about whether or not other journalists should be charged with felonies. The assumption
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.160]  in your question, David, is completely without evidence, the idea that I've aided and abetted
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:05.160]  him in any way.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:09.640]  The scandal that arose in Washington before our stories began was about the fact that
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:14.360]  the Obama administration is trying to criminalize investigative journalism by going through
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.080]  the emails and phone records of AP reporters, accusing a Fox News journalist of the theory
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:24.640]  that you just embraced being a co-conspirator in felonies for working with sources.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.680]  If you want to embrace that theory, it means that every investigative journalist in the
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.680]  United States-
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:33.560]  I've played that before. Wayne, briefly, what do you make of this beating the drums to arrest
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.560]  American journalists?
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:41.800]  Yeah, this same David Gregory, who was dancing at a White House dinner once with Karl Rove,
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:47.480]  who outed Valerie Plain Wilson, who was a covert CIA agent. So he's talking about aiding
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:53.840]  and abetting somebody. David Gregory danced with somebody who was involved in leaking
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.840]  classes.
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.800]  Yeah, so he's aiding and abetting. I mean, the whole point is, everybody knows they're
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:02.200]  aiding. Snowden did what I think is very patriotic for liberty worldwide. He didn't give out
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:07.080]  the codes to the ICBMs. He didn't ship our jobs to China. He didn't sell us out to foreign
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:08.440]  banks. That's the aiding and abetting.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  Briefly, I want to go to calls here, Wayne, of WayneMatsonReport.com. We have it linked
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:17.040]  up in your reports with all this breaking news, with the documents, with the spike story,
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.800]  the screenshots while they're still there. Of the story, they spiked at The Guardian
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:27.320]  and Observer at Infowars.com with links to WayneMatsonReport.com. Wayne, bottom line,
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:31.200]  I've talked to the people that have talked to the family, his best buddy. He says, yeah,
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.200]  they think he was killed.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.960]  They want an investigation. That should be news. What do you think, or have you heard
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:41.960]  from your sources on The Hill that the associate editor at The New York Times, Michael Hastings,
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:42.960]  was reporting on?
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:47.680]  Look, I haven't always agreed with Richard Clark, the former counter-terrorism czar
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:52.080]  for the Clinton and Bush administrations. But he came out and stated that it's possible
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.960]  to put a hack into the computer in that-
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:56.960]  Very easy.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:01.860]  ... that Hastings was driving. Now, look, I'm going to be accused of doing another conspiracy
[01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:07.400]  theory. That's the charge that all these sites are making and all these people on the internet.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:12.880]  But let me say that I was in London and Paris right after Princess Diana's death in the
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:15.120]  car crash in the tunnel in Paris.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.400]  Oh, they remote controlled it.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:21.480]  I heard the same thing then, and how many years ago was that? So how old is the technology?
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:27.120]  Clark knows how old it is. And certainly that's what happened with Princess Diana.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:33.400]  Yeah, they could put a special box on cars that are 50 years old. But cars the last 15
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.640]  years or so have the plug right in to totally control them. That's DARPA's own briefings
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:43.040]  since about the mid 1990s, so longer than 15 years. But I mean, his family is out saying
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.080]  they think that he was killed, and then no media will touch that.
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:52.400]  Yeah, I don't... What I know is the stories he was working on, he was working on a story
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:58.480]  about the former CIA chief in Algiers who was put in jail. He's serving time in Ashland,
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:05.000]  Kentucky in a federal penitentiary there now. He spoke like five or six Arabic dialects.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.080]  They got him on some sort of sexual harassment charge. One thing led to another. Now he's
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:16.480]  serving time. He was a convert to Islam, an African American, which is very rare to find
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.400]  with the CIA station chief. And yet he's serving time. So I don't see President Obama, our
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:25.640]  first African American president, doing anything to help this guy out.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.600]  No, he's just making sure they increase forced abortion funding in Africa. Joseph, sorry,
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:33.000]  go ahead. I was just gonna say Hastings interviewed
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:42.960]  him in his jail cell in Kentucky. He was also working on the Jill Kelly story, the woman
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.120]  of course, who was involved with the email sort of-
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.880]  Absolutely. Let's just jam in a few final calls. He can cover this more tomorrow. Joseph,
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:56.040]  real fast question from Missouri for Wayne Madsen. Go ahead, sir. Thanks for calling.
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:03.720]  Yeah, Mr. Madsen, Mr. Jones. We know through history about American and England playing
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:09.440]  the role with Hitler and put in such force. The idea came to me, I'm a religious, I'm
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  not a religious person. Sure, ask your question, bro. We're almost
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:18.840]  Okay, what if all this was a setup, not Mr. Snowden involved, but religiously some believe
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.000]  Russia and China will come against America. What if this was all just you could say, hey-
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.840]  Well, yeah, no, our government shipped all our industry to China on purpose. So that
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:34.880]  is part of the globalist plan, Wayne Madsen. Yeah, I don't think China or Russia really
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:39.280]  wanted to see Snowden wind up in one case in Hong Kong, which is a special-
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.560]  Yeah, Russia's told him get out. Russia said leave. They already know all this.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:49.800]  Right, and I mean, they don't wanna turn them over, but the US is like a little spoiled
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:53.120]  brat the way we threaten countries with all kinds of-
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.720]  Absolutely. Let's take another one here. Let's talk to Patrick in Oregon. Real quick question,
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.720]  Patrick. Sorry, I waited till the end. Go ahead.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:05.160]  It's okay. Hi, guys. Hey, my question is, do you think Snowden is a real guy? I mean,
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:09.360]  do you think they just fabricated him out of thin air just so they can use this as a-
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:14.280]  I think he's real, but they're gonna try to spin it the way they want. I think he's real.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.360]  Wayne? Yeah, he's real. I talked to a lot of people
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:25.460]  that know exactly where he's worked. And I know there was this idea that as he's serving
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:31.520]  some other agenda, he just shocked a lot of people when he walked away and wound up in
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:38.440]  Hong Kong. That happened in NSA before, back in the 60s. There were two mathematicians
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:44.600]  working on crypto codes that actually wound up at a news conference in Moscow. They were
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  spies.
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:49.200]  They said they'd rather live in the Soviet Union. They were Marxists working on crypto
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.160]  codes. Can you believe it? At NSA, Martin and Mitchell. But that was a little different
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.000]  than this guy. This guy's a libertarian patriot.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.680]  Yeah, yeah. Martin and Mitchell were communists who didn't like working at NSA.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.920]  Paula, do you disagree with that point? Do you have a point to add?
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:10.560]  No, I kind of agree. But what's the Russians gonna do? Is Putin gonna take his laptop and
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.320]  look through it or what's going on?
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.760]  He'll probably take his shirt off and run around on a horse. Listen, we're out of time
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:19.440]  here. In fact, if you guys want to give us your name and number, we'll call you back
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:23.000]  tomorrow when Wayne's on and let you have your questions tomorrow. The loaded phone's
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.860]  over there. If not, call back when he's on guest hosting for 30 minutes and three hours
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:32.040]  with Mike Adams, noon to 3 Eastern, 11 AM to 2 PM Central.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.880]  Wayne, be safe. I don't think you've gotten death threats. We appreciate your courage.
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.240]  Okay, good to be with you, Alex.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:41.760]  You're awesome. Great job to the crew. Great job to all our affiliates and our great listeners.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.900]  Pray for this broadcast. Pray for America. Pray for liberty and a return to the Constitution
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:53.120]  bell of rights and what made this nation great and what made the world great. God bless you.
